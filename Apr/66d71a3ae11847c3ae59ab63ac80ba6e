YESTERDAY marked exactly a year since Akhumzi Jezile died. The award-winning actor, presenter and director died in a car crash with four of his friends: actress and singer Siyasanga Kobese, actor Thobani Mseleni, Skhumbuzo Mbuthuma and Tumi Morake. Yesterday, family and friends gathered to remember him and to keep his legacy alive through the Akhumzi Jezile Foundation. Akhumzi’s mum Zoleka announced that the foundation to honour his name was aimed at changing behaviour on the road, to educate road users and provide support. Zoleka told Daily Sun it was what Akhumzi would have wanted. “He would have tried to make sure what happened to him didn’t happen to other people. That’s who he was.” The foundation started off by asking people to light a candle in Akhumzi’s memory. Treasurer Alex Hlabangane said: “This was Ma Zoleka’s wish. She didn’t want her son’s death to be in vain, and that’s how the foundation was born. “We want people to make better choices on the road while educating and supporting them.” Alex told the People’s Paper there will be a launch and campaigns once the foundation had partners and sponsors. #SmartRoadChronicles is driving the message behind the campaign and can be followed on all social media networks at @akzfoundation. Social media was flooded with messages of remembrance as Akhumzi’s family, friends and fans remembered the five who died.
