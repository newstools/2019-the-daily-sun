YOUTH violence is a growing challenge. Addressing the root cause of violence, and preventing youth from getting sucked into it, is vital. Jabu Khambule was once a humble young man, according to family and friends, but things went wrong in matric. He was 17 and his school work was impressive. His family and teachers were proud of him. “When my parents split, life became difficult for me and I ended up doing drugs and dropped out of school.” No one wanted to associate with him and he ended up keeping the wrong company. One day while drinking with friends, he got into a fight and ended up with a scar on his forehead and left arm. “Today, four years down the line, I’m trying to get my life back on track. I play soccer with likeminded peers who want to change their lives for the better. “I’m tired of nursing injuries I got because of drug abuse, alcohol and nyaope,” said the troubled Jabu. SunHealth spoke to family member Mavis Khambule, who said: “Jabu used to be a good young man and was dedicated to his school work. “But things turned bad when his parents divorced and he ended up dropping out before matric. “He needs professional help because the family tried our best to advise him, but we lacked the necessary skills to solve his problems.”
