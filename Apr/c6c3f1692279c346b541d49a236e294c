HE kidnapped the shop owner, killed him and buried him in a shallow grave in his yard. But he kept using the dead man’s phone. What he didn’t know was that cops were tracking calls and the phone led them to the killer and the dead man. Shocked neighbours watched as the body of the man was dug out from a house in Devon, Gauteng, last Thursday. Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs Police Station said the man had been missing for six days. The suspect was shocked when cops came to his doorstep and asked him about the phone. “When interrogated about the phone he eventually confessed.” The 34-year-old suspect faces murder charges. The suspect’s 29-year-old brother told Daily Sun that after the incident, he saw a pile of soil but just thought his brother had been cleaning the yard. “There was no smell and it never occurred to me it could be a grave in our yard,” he said. Captain Ramphora said the suspect appeared in court to face murder charges and will make his second appearance soon.
