EASTER is supposed to be a time for celebrating Christian values, but this family from KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, spent the weekend fighting. Duduzile Mkhwanazi (79) allegedly poured boiling water over her nephew Mandla (32) on Saturday. Trouble apparently started when she asked him to turn off the TV. He told Daily Sun: “On Saturday morning she was boiling water in the kitchen and complaining the TV was making too much noise. “We argued about it the previous night and I told her to stop shouting because the issue was over.” He said when he walked past her, she poured boiling water over him. “I ran to my brother’s shack to hide because I thought she’d follow me. I stayed there until I was rushed to hospital,” he said. Mandla said he and his aunt have been arguing since she came to live with him in January. “Whenever we argued, she’d say she hates me.” Mandla said he opened a case against his aunt while in hospital, but when he returned home she wasn’t there. Residents were shocked by the incident. One said: “This woman must go away.” Mandla’s brother Mthokosizi (41) said: “What my aunt did is evil and I want her to be arrested”. Duduzile said Mandla pushed her into attacking him. “I didn’t mean to but was angry.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an assault case was opened.
