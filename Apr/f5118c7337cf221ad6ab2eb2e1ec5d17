ETHEKWINI Municipality water and sanitation workers have vowed to continue with their strike despite management’s call to return to work. Workers downed tools on Wednesday, demanding the immediate cancellation of Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans’ promotions. Workers at the Pinetown and Springfield depots parked water trucks yesterday and vowed to return to work only when management reversed its decision. Workers claimed that management increased MK veterans’ salaries by taking them from grade four to grade 10 level. Workers said grade 10 was for qualified plumbers who earned about R20 000, while grade four was handy men with no matric, earning R6 000. After holding an urgent meeting with the union on Wednesday night, municipal manager Sipho Nzuza said he set up a task team to investigate how the promotion was done. He urged workers to return to work immediately, but they told Daily Sun they would not return to work until the decision was reversed. “The strike continues and we will not return to work until the matter is resolved. We are not against the promotion of MK veterans, but we must all be promoted. We all need money and no one will be treated special because he went to exile. We all fought for freedom,” said one worker. Samwu provincial secretary Jaycee Ncanana said their members were waiting for the municipality to correct the matter before returning to work. Mkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association head in KZN, Themba Mavundla, said the municipality did nothing wrong as the veterans deserved special treatment for liberating the country.
