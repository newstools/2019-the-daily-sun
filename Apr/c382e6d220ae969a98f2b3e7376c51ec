The EFF would like to caution all artists and entertainers of a person going by the name of Sibusiso Buthelezi, with a company name Tamasco, claiming to be booking artists for EFF Tshela Thupa Rally. This person does not act on behalf of the EFF and no artists must trust him or his company. The EFF will book artists directly for its Tshela Thupa Rally to be held on 05 May, 2019. We condemn anyone, anywhere, who seeks to mislead artists and cause confusion and disrepute in the name of the EFF. We have no Sibusiso Buthelezi in the EFF or any relationship with a company by the name of Tamasco.
