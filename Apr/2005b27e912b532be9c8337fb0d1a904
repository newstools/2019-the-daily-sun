MEMBERS of the St Paul Latter Rain Church in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, are angry. They claimed they were attending a service on Sunday when Metro cops stormed into their structure. The members were shocked as they watched cops demolish the church. They claimed the damage caused was about R37 000. Bishop Godfrey Mahlangeni said the cops just arrived without notice on Sunday. “What the cops did was unholy. Shame on them for disrespecting the house of the Lord,” he said. Angry members said they don’t know why their church was targeted. Daily Sun noticed that not far from their demolished church there was another church which had a steel roof, and workers were putting slabs on the sides. A church member said: “We worked hard to raise money to build the church. “We would not have refused to move if they had given us enough time to find another place. “Now the cops have demolished our church. “We are now forced to hire a tent and that costs a lot of money.” Themba Gadebe, a spokesman for Ekurhuleni Municipality, told the People’s Paper: “There are certain procedures to be followed when looking for land to build a church, but the municipality will investigate the matter.” He said the church received notice before, but they ignored it until the Metro cops came to demolish the structure.
