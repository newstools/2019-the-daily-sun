COMMUNITY Safety MEC Pat Ngomane warned residents of Mganduzweni, outside White River in Mpumalanga, not to follow fake pastors or evil sangomas. He was addressing mourners during the funeral service of Nontokozo (5) and Silindile Qibi (6), who were murdered last Tuesday. The sisters’ naked bodies were found on Wednesday morning dumped under a tree near a stream. Ngomane said fake pastors and evil sangomas should be exposed because they are a serious danger. “We want to encourage those who know what happened to come to the police and give information. “If someone is a criminal who happens to be a part of killing these children, regardless of being a sangoma or pastor, they must be arrested,” he said. Ngomane said residents should work together to make sure such incidents don’t happen. “The safety of the people in this area rests upon all of us. “We must be responsible for the safety of our children.” Bheki Malumane (36) and Wonder Mbuyane (24) were killed by residents on Thursday after they allegedly confessed the two girls.
