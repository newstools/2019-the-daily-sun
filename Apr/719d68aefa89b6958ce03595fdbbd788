BRENDA and David Kgaje still want to bury their dead newborn baby – even though their child was buried a year ago by another family. Their ordeal started on 13 April last year when Brenda wanted to say goodbye to her dead baby at Job Shimankana Tabane Hospital’s mortuary in Rustenburg, North West. But to her horror, her baby’s body had been swapped with another. DNA tests later confirmed that the remains of another baby were given to Brenda and David. The mum of this baby is Oratile Moetapele, of Luka in Rustenburg. The Kgaje baby’s remains were never exhumed. “There were three new babies who died at the hospital that week,” said Brenda (35). “We don’t want to end up burying the wrong baby again. The hospital must exhume the baby and pay for DNA tests. If the results are negative then they must find the third family.” David and Brenda feel the DNA tests should have been done at the time the baby was given to them the first time. The hospital agreed to help the Kgajes with transport to go and bury the baby. Tebogo Lekgethwane, spokesman for the North West Health Department, said the hospital would assist with DNA tests. “The matter has been handed over so it can be sorted out,” he said.
