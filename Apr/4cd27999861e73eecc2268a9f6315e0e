 COPS in Mahwelereng outside Mokopane have arrested seven
suspects for stealing cattle. The suspects were arrested after they were found in
possession of suspected stolen live cattle. Police spokesperson Constable Maphure Manamela said the
positive reaction by members of crime prevention after receiving a tip-off from
the farming community about the unknown men herding cattle in the bushes,
resulted into their arrest. He said three of the suspects were cornered along a gravel
road from Ga-Mashashane leading to the N11 between Ga-Molekane and Ga-Magongwa
village. This as they were herding twelve cattle on foot. Their accomplices were driving in a VW Golf GTI without
registration numbers. Manamela said the origin of the stolen cattle will be
determined by the ongoing police investigations. The suspects may be linked to other stock theft cases within
the province. All seven suspects will appear before Mokerong Magistrate's
Court soon.
