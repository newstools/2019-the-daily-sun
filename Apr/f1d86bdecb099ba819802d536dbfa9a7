GIVE Mohlomi a microphone and he will get you dancing. The gospel singer started singing at the age of 15. Mohlomi Mohale (37) from Namibia, Mangaung said he was inspired by Sifiso Ncwane and Benjamin Dube. He told Daily Sun: “In 2016, I recorded an album called O Na Le Matla and recorded a live DVD last year. “I am now busy with a single featuring Themba Masina, which will be released in July.” He said he was good at songwriting and wrote for artists in the Free State and other provinces. “I sell my music at shows like the Bloem Show gospel festival, social media, by hand and at church events. “It makes me happy when the audience responds to my performance, which is why I make sure I always provide them with hot music. “I always knew I had a voice that would get me fans. People are happy with my work.” Mohlomi said he preached through music. “The music journey is challenging but worth it. It just needs patience. I also own a general trading business and media company.”
