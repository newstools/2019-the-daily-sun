IT IS not every day that people survive a car accident. But when one does, they are usually very grateful. A few days ago Daily Sun ran the story about Ntando Bangani’s accident, which saw his car being written off. Days later, the Themba Lami singer told Timeslive he didn’t have major injuries or broken bones. “The accident was quite bad, it shocked me. The impact was significant to the extent airbags came out. The car is a write-off,” he said. “I’m fine. There are no broken bones. It’s just the shock of it all that I’m dealing with. “Sitting here, looking at my son, I think I could have died. To think I’d have missed moments of being with my family. It really opens your eyes.”
