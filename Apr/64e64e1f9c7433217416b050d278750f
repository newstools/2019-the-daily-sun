TOMORROW’S National First Division (NFD) match between Stellenbosch and Nedbank Cup finalists, TS Galaxy, at the Idas Valley Sports Ground promises to be a masterclass with both teams having one aim – winning. The Stellies are challenging for the championship and promotion to the PSL, but interestingly they would be happy to prove to Galaxy that they are a better team. On the other hand, Dan Malesela said he would use the match to retain their top eight position. But most importantly, he will use the game as a barometer to assess the level of injuries in the team following a 120 minutes of sapping football when they knocked Golden Arrows out of the Nedbank Cup. “We have no serious injuries. It’s only fatigue after we played for 120 minutes. We need to manage our players well for Wednesday and next weekend matches,” Malesela told SunSport. They will meet Kaizer Chiefs in the Ke Yona final where the two thirsty teams would be competing for the gold medal and bragging rights. They are the only NFD team to have gone and qualified for the Nedbank Cup final, schediled for Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on 18 May. Malesela said this is one match they need to win for their hordes of “red army” from Mpumalanga. Said Malesela: “This (qualifying for the final) is what we wanted. “This is historic for us. And we might win it. It is all in our hands now.” His only challenge is that Chiefs will dominate them on the stands with their large number of supporters. But he is confident that they will compete in the field of play. He said he anticipated a good spectacle driven by “open play and no parking of the bus”.
