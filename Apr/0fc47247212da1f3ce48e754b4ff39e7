  Archbishop
Emeritus Desmond Tutu was honoured for his role in the liberation of Mzansi and
his fight against social injustice. Tutu and
his wife Leah attended the Freedom Day event at the Old Granary building in Cape
Town. The event
was organised by the Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation where photographer and
artist Benny Gool handed them photographs and paintings. Gool who
used to photograph Tutu in the 80’s and artist Richard Scott presented a box
full of various pictures of Tutu and his wife. They handed
over the archbishop a “Tutu Art Box” containing a photobook of pop-art
interpretations of Gool’s historic photographs of Archbishop Tutu. When the
pink leather box was opened, it contained a book with photographs by Gool and
paintings and photographs by Scott. The
foreword of a book was done by business mogul Sir Richard Branson. “Thank you
very much for the book,” Tutu said after the book was presented to him. The launch
of the Art Box precedes a full-scale exhibition of Gool and Scott’s work, to be
unveiled at Artscape Theatre in Cape Town in August. Speaking
during the event, Roger Friedman from the Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation said:
“Benny chatted to Richard and suggested that they collaborate in some way, and
this gathering today is the outcome of that process. We
discussed the project with Archbishop, and we brought the Desmond and Leah Tutu
Foundation on board as the beneficiary of the sale.” The
photobook also comprises of the statements made by Tutu for the past 20 years. The
chairperson of the Tutu Foundation Marlene Le Roux thanked the artists for
taking time to bring the box together. “To the
artist I want to say thank you. The Tutu box is more than just a box, but it is
about us talking about our humanity,” said Le Roux.
