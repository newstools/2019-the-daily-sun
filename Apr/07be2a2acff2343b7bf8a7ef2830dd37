THREE people are fighting for their lives in hospital after the Toyota Tazz they were travelling in rolled several times. This was on the busiest road in Cottondale, outside Acornhoek, in Mpumalanga. The incident happened on Saturday at about 6pm. Shocked taxi driver Freddy Sibuyi (52), said the speeding Tazz was trying to avoid a pothole. The car was facing an oncoming bakkie at a bend and swerved off the road before hitting a truck. “The Tazz was going so fast that the driver, a boy and a woman, were thrown out of the window. “Even the groceries were flung out as the car rolled several times,” said Sibuyi. “We quickly turned off the engine to save the life of the woman trapped under the car.” Gogo Letta Mashile (62) of nearby Buffelshoek confirmed to police that the injured were her daughter Karabo Monareng, her son-in-law Solomon Moeng and their son Lloyd. “It is hurting that heartless thugs stole almost everything including the groceries at the scene, and some of the car parts scattered on the road,” said gogo Letta. Captain Mpho Nonyane confirmed that police are investigating a case of reckless driving but no one was arrested.
