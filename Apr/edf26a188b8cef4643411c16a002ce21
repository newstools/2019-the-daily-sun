BAROKA enhanced their chances of starving off relegation with a massive 1-0 win against AmaZulu at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. Free State Stars, however, still face the spectre of relegation after they went down 2-1 to Golden Arrows at Princess Magogo Stadium in the other match. But the picture will become much clearer after the next round as the bottom four teams aren't separated by too many points. Ea Lla Koto could have edged that much closer to safety with victory over Golden Arrows at the Princess Magogo Stadium yesterday. But the Bethlehem-based outfit slumped to a 2-1 defeat, their 14th of the season and continue to look over their shoulder. They will now have to do it the hard way as their final two games of the season are against Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns (11 May) Stars have amassed 26 points from 28 matches and are just four points adrift of the magical 30 point mark, which generally ensures safety. Knox Mutizwa’s brace was enough to hand Abafana Besthende the all-important three points and boost their chances of getting into the top eight. Steve Khompela’s charges are now on 36 points from 28 matches, only a solitary point adrift of eighth-placed Bloemfontein Celtic. Baroka, who are also candidates for the drop, took a massive step towards safety as they moved above Leopards and Stars into 12th following their 1-0 win over AmaZulu at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Midfielder Tshediso Patjie popped up with the winner in the 85th minute for the Ga-Mphahlele side, just when the match was heading for a draw.
