POLOKWANE City head coach, Jozef Vukusic, has reprimanded his players against the disrespect of undermining other Absa Premiership teams, and advised them to treat them all equally. The on form Rise and Shine host troubled Bloemfontein Celtic in a league clash at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm). City come to this clash on the back of an impressive run of eight games without defeat – won three and drew five. The last time Rise and Shine lost a league match was two months ago when they went down 3-1 to Maritzburg United. “There is no time to relax,” said the Slovakia born mentor. “We cannot start thinking that we have made it and take other teams lightly. We have four games to go and that means we should apply the same fighting spirit in all of them. Our aim is to finish as high as we can.” City have amassed 41 points and would be looking at jumping into the top three. On the other side Phunya Sele Sele have gone six matches without victory – lost three and drew three. Celtic’s last league clash against Cape Town City was abandoned on Sunday after the pitch invasion by their toyi-toying fans, which saw the club being charged by the league. The acts of hooliganism by Celtic fans saw the club charged with failure to provide adequate security for the match and bringing the league, sponsors Absa, Safa, Caf and Fifa into disrepute. They are expected to appear before the PSL disciplinary committee tomorrow. But Vukusic still expects war from the Free Staters tonight: “Celtic are a tough side and we must be at our best to get a positive result against them,” explained Vukusic “Our preparations went well and that is why we told the boys to take this clash serious. Our aim is to fight for three points.”
