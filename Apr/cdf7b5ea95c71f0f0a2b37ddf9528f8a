President Cyril Ramaphosa has fired advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi. This comes after former Constitutional Court justice Yvonne Mokgoro suggested that Ramaphosa fire the two advocates. The inquiry which is established in terms of Section 12 (6) of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Act, probed Jiba and Mrwebiâ€™s fitness to hold the office of Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions and Special Director. The inquiry is led by Justice Mokgoro, assisted by Senior Counsel Kgomotso Moroka and Attorney Thenjiwe Vilakazi.
