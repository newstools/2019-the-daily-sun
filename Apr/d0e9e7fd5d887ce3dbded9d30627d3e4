HER daughter borrowed money from a mashonisa to buy food – and when she couldn’t repay the interest, he stripped the house. Gogo Smangele Gama (55) and her daughter were left sitting on the floor last month, with nothing in the house and no way to survive. But on Friday things changed. Cops, business people and residents came to give her clothes and to renovate her house in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni. Gogo Smangele said she was happy her house was refreshed. It was painted and the floors fitted with new vinyl covering. She also received a fridge, stove, clothes and blankets. “My home is warm now thanks to people who extended a helping hand,” she said. “My daughter borrowed money and we paid the mashonisa but he wanted more and that’s when he came to take our things. “He was aggressive and couldn’t understand when we told him we didn’t owe him anything.” Local physiotherapist Palesa Conco said she was touched when she visited the family, and decided to help. She donated vinyl and paint and hired an electrician to rewire the gogo’s house. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe appealed to the public to open their hands more. “The family doesn’t have beds and they sleep on a mattress on the floor. We urge people not to turn to mashonisa as some take things from a house to sell to get the money owed to them.” Social worker Jabu Peterson said the family will get grants in future as they have now been issued with Sassa cards.
