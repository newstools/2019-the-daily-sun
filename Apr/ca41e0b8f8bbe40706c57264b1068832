Bishop Moses Sibiya of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Empangeni, northern KZN, said his church was under attack. “We are extremely sad to see such painful incidents. “We see them as the work of the devil. We won’t see them as bad luck as it could happen anywhere, like the recent floods,” he said. This comes after the bus carrying mourners who were attending a mass funeral for five church members in Ulundi was involved in an crash. It left 35 people injured. Sibiya said the bus was carrying people from various parts of Ulundi. “From what we heard at the scene, we were told the bus failed to drive up a steep hill when it was transporting mourners to KwaCeza. “Witnesses said the bus rolled back and ended up in a trench.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the bus driver was driving to KwaCeza on Sunday when he allegedly lost control and hit a wall. “Thirty-five passengers sustained minor injuries. A case of reckless and negligent driving was opened at Ulundi Police Station for investigation,” said Gwala. ) KZN Premier Willies Mchunu marked 3 May as a day of mourning and prayer to mark the recent devastating floods.
