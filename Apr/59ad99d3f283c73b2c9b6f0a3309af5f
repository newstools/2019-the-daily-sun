THE smell was unbearable! Motorists drove with their windows closed, while pedestrians shielded their noses with their hands. Food sellers on the corner of Solomon Mahlangu Road and Hinterland Drive packed their food and left. Gatvol residents of Phomolong in Mamelodi East, Pretoria, brought buckets full of kak to the streets to protest over the non-emptying of toilets. After spilling the kak on the street, two mobile plastic toilets were upended and set alight. Resident Matlakala Kotsedi (30) said it had been a month since the toilets were last emptied and cleaned. He said they could not take it anymore. That’s why they decided to show people what they went through daily. “People are covering their noses now, but we have to cover our noses every day. There are flies everywhere. They get into the toilets and come back to our food,” he said. He said the toilets were last emptied in February and had been left unattended since. “We just wait and hope they will be cleaned, but we are acting now before the kak makes us sick,” he said. Food vendor Meikie Sondlo (50) was not impressed with the protesters. “Why should adults carry kak and disturb everyone? I have lost money because of this.” Councillor Doris Maja said the service provider had a problem with his truck. She said the provider was also held hostage when the truck was fixed and he went to empty the toilets. She said the protest had been hijacked by criminals. The municipality is now holding meetings with service providers so the toilets can be emptied.
