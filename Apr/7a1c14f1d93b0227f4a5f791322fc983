MALEBO Mathopa’s special effects make people look scary but in fact she’s just using normal make-up. Her hair-raising pictures have horrified many people on social media. The talented make-up artist has also applied the effects to her own face. The 20-year-old from Moletjie outside Polokwane, Limpopo told Daily Sun she grew up watching horror and action movies. “I never got scared and believe that was a calling for me to work with scary images.” The Unisa environmental management student said even though she is a self-taught make-up artist, she would love to study it. “I want to become well-known across the world as a professional make-up artist.” “At first, my pictures scared people, who’d cry for me, thinking I’d been bitten or had been in an accident. “My friends told me to open a case against the person who assaulted me until they realised it was only make-up.” Malebo said her dream is to work in soapies and movies. “I’ve been receiving calls from artists who want to shoot music videos and films,” she said.
