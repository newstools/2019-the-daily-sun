A STUDY suggests that ugly guys have bigger balls than good-looking ones! This study was led by Stefan Lupold, a biologist at the University of Zurich. He first looked at two types of chimpanzees and found males can either look amazing or have big balls, but not both. Long beards, swelling and brightly-coloured skin serve to impress females and intimidate other males. “Our study only focused on between-species relationships, so we can’t jump to the conclusion, as done by a few news outlets, that bearded men have small testes,” Lupold said. Daily Sun asked SunReaders if they thought this theory could be applied to humans. However, not everyone agreed. Let’s wait for outcomes.” “Instead of doing their best they’re thinking about their looks and end up flopping.”
