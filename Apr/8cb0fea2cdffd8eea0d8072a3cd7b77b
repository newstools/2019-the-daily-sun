A TAXI ride turned into an adventure all because of R1! Thokozile Mhlungu (33) from Dobsonville in Soweto took a taxi from Dobsonville to Leratong Hospital on Wednesday. “We all paid, but the money was R1 short,” said Thokozile. She said their taxi was approaching Roodepoort when the driver shouted that the money paid was short. “He asked for the person who had paid R9 instead of R10 to bring the remaining balance. No one said anything,” she said. Thokozile said the driver kept quiet and they thought he’d decided to let the issue go. But at the next intersection, he turned back in the direction they came from. She said when they started complaining that he was going back, he kept quiet. She said when passengers attempted to pay the R1, the driver refused to take it. “He just kept on driving until he reached the area he picked us up from. Then he told us to get out,” she said. Daily Sun asked SunReaders on Facebook what other taxi adventures they had experienced. Wiseman Khotsholo said: “I was in a Siyaya. As I was getting out, the door accidentally came off. The driver looked at me as if I had killed his sister. He told me to fix the door.” Taxi driver Sbongiseni Maduna said: “We also need to be respected. No one goes to Nando’s and buys a full chicken with short money. They respect Nando’s, why not us?”
