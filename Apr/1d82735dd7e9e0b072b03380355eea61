NONTSIKELELO Magengenene (23) kissed her gogo, said goodbye and left for work. That was the last time her gogo saw her because only a few minutes later, the young woman was dead. Gogo Jemina Mothae (79), from Unique Homes in Mangaung, said: “I didn’t know it was the last time I would see her alive. She left for work at 6am on Sunday morning. When I heard people scream I asked my other grandchild to go and see what had happened.” Nontsikelelo was not far from home when she allegedly met her killers, who robbed her of her cellphone. “I didn’t believe she was dead until I saw her body in the mortuary,” said the gogo. “Her killers killed me alive. I’m bedridden. Nontsikelelo always helped me. “Now I have to stay at an old age home.” She told Daily Sun before her granddaughter left she wanted to bath her. “If I’d known she was going to be killed, I would have let her bath me just so I could feel her touch for the last time. “Ntsikelelo was too young to die. I’m heartbroken,” said gogo Jemina. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a murder case was opened. “On Sunday at about 6am the victim was walking to work on Manyane Street when she was attacked, stabbed and robbed of her Samsung J1. “No arrest has been made yet,” said Hlubi.
