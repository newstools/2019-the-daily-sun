GUGULETHU residents are happy with the good work of their neighbourhood watch. Members of the community group handed over residents’ property recovered from thugs on Wednesday night. Robbery victim Mandisi Ndabeni (20) said: “I was waiting at the bus stop when thugs pounced on me last week. “I reported it to the neighbourhood watch. “They later called to tell me they had recovered my phone. I was so worried but now I’m happy.” Nomvuyo Mabokwe from Stormont Madubela Primary School said the dustbin at the school was stolen. “We told the neighbourhood watch and three days later, they called to tell us they had recovered it. “We sometimes report these issues at the cop shop but get no results. We are grateful our neighbours take action, no matter how small the crime is.” Chairman Manelisi Sisulu said he’d been part of the neighbourhood organisation since 2004 and was happy residents trusted them. To deal with crime, Sisulu said they forced illegal shebeens to close at 10pm because they realised many people were robbed while coming back from shebeens. The group has meetings every Tuesday and Thursday and encourage people to report crime. Mum of two Ntombentsha Masiko, a member of the group, said she’s committed her life to serving people. Gugulethu commander Captain Zwe Nkabi praised the efforts of the neighbourhood watch. “We are proud of these men and women. They are helping us and we have managed to reduce crime with their help.”
