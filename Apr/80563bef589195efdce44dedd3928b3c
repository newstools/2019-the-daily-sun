The EFF and the ANC faced off on Tuesday at the Rand Show at
the Nasrec Expo Centre in the South of Johannesburg. Just as former President Thabo Mbeki was pledging his
support for the ANC in the upcoming elections at the ANC Pavillion at the show,
the EFF commander in Chief Julius Malema hit the stalls engaging the public and
business owners who were showcasing their products at the show. Malema said he felt that it was important to hit the show to
support small business owners and just get boots on the ground for the EFF and
engage people and convince them to vote EFF in the upcoming elections.  Addressing the media Malema said that MPs who've come up
accusing him and Floyd Shivambu of abusing the funds are bitter, that they are
either not on the list or didn't make it high enough. Malema said that journalist is free to have a look at their
books and decide for themselves whether there has been wrongdoing. Malema said that they are not going to be going into
elections with the DA. "I don't imagine myself sitting with Mmusi Maimane
again on the same table after he accused us of stealing VBS even though there's
no such evidence," Malema said. Malema said that they are open to working with the ANC on
possible coalitions. Malema also admitted that they have been struggling to
secure the crucial female vote.  He said though the party has progressive views on female
issues and the LGBTIQ community, they have been struggling to get the vote. He said they are working on finding out what women have to
say about the EFF. “We are trying to learn as to what is the problem voter of
the female voter when it comes to the EFF. We are conducting our own internal
research to find out what the females are saying about the EFF,” Malema said.
