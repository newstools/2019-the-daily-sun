NO more long queues at the clinic! Phedisong Clinic in Qalabotjha kasi has had a facelift. Free State Health and the Rand Water Foundation handed over the renovated clinic on Tuesday. The event was attended by Free State Health MEC Montseng Tsiu, chairman of the Rand Water Board Mdibanisi Tsheke and Mafube mayor Jabulani Segasa. The clinic treats about 10 000 patients each month. Ward 3 Councillor Fusi Motloung said patients used to stand in long queues in the sun because there was never enough space inside to wait. “With winter slowly creeping up on us, patients can keep warm inside the clinic whilewaiting. There are enough chairs in the waiting area.” General manager of the foundation, Mohlahleho Sekoaila said: “When we heard about the challenge Qalabotjha residents faced at the dilapidated Phedisong Clinic, it was a no brainer for us to get involved. “It was heartbreaking to see queues of the elderly, women and children standing in the hot sun, waiting to receive medical care. “Our vision is to be an agent of change for our mother organisation, Rand Water, focusing on people who live in our areas of service. “During the first site visit, we took a decision right there and then to get involved in renewing the clinic in partnership with the department,” Sekoaila said.
