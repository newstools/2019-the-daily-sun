KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has revealed that Lebogang Manyama has suffered a minor injury setback as his injury-disrupted season continues. The highly-rated forward has made just 15 appearances in the current campaign after having been sidelined due to a number of injuries. Firstly, Manyama was ruled out after a car accident which lead to a broken bone in his arm. He then returned and suffered a knee injury not long thereafter. It appears the 28-year-old is now set to be out for a little bit longer as he picked up a mild muscle strain. With that said, Middendorp believes he could feature against Free State Stars at least as a late substitute. He said: "Everyone has the qualities to assess and judge what the performance and abilities of Lebo Manyama is. "He is and was, during the December-January period before he got brutally kicked against AmaZulu, one of the most qualified players in terms of knowing exactly where he has to be calm in possession, passing and finishing. "It's very disappointing that we still have to wait. He got a little bit of a grade one muscle tear, which is normal procedure of reality, but he was already on a good way recovering similarly or probably even a bit more advanced to Joseph Molangoane. "We will see what's possible. We're planning probably to play him against Free State Stars for some minutes."
