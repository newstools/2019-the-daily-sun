FIKILE Mbalula has called re-arranged ANC posters dirty politics. Mbalula, head of ANC elections, said on his Facebook page: “Dirty politics will get you nowhere. We know who you are.” He said rogue opposition elements are using fake posters to discredit what he called the clearly effective ANC campaign. “We are unmoved. We are undeterred. We are growing South Africa,” he said. Mbalula was responding to ANC posters being re-written on social media. A poster with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s face on it and the words: “The people’s choice” was changed to “The Poephol’s choice”. Another original poster reading: “Let’s grow South Africa together” was changed to “Let’s grow South Africa togher”. Social media users found the posters funny. “The ANC has been in power for so many years but still we are suffering. I agree with the first re-arranged poster,” said Boi Boi on Facebook.
