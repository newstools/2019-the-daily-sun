 THE South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) axed its Chief Operations Officer Chris Maroleng with immediate effect on Tuesday. The corporation issued a statement saying the board had met on Tuesday and decided to terminate Marolengâ€™s contract. "After due consideration of the findings and recommendations of a disciplinary process, the Board resolved to terminate the contract of employment of its Chief Operations Officer, Mr. Chris Maroleni, with immediate effect." Speaking to Jacaranda FM, Maroleng said the decision by the SABC to axe him was somewhat harsh. "It's very important that we set the record straight. I acted in the interest of the SABC at all times and I think it should be pointed out that in all the decisions I made, these were done in the interest of the SABC, " Maroleng said. The City Press previously reported that Maroleng was in hot water after allegations that Maroleng protected the company's former group executive for sport Marcia Mahlalela, who quit before she was about to face a disciplinary inquiry over her appointment of Robert Marawa to SABC radio allegedly without following due process. Maroleng is accused of writing a letter to the South African Rugby Union exonerating Mahlalela of the accusations against her, saying the SABC considered the accusations against her unsubstantiated.
