SAMUEL is homeless while someone is living comfortably in his RDP. He said he did everything legal to get an RDP and waited for a new project to be completed so he could get one. But people hijacked the project and occupied the houses before they were finished. Now he’s got a house number and is the legal owner, but other people are living in his house. Thabazimbi Municipality gave him another house number but that house was also occupied. Samuel Moremong (60) from Block 7, Northam, in Limpopo said: “I asked the municipality to consider me first when a new housing project started, but they said I already had a house.” Daily Sun went to see the house and found a gogo living there called Nontsika Nzima. When asked how she got the house, she said: “How do people get houses? They walk through the door. That’s what I did. I found this house and moved in. It’s been years and if I go now, where will I go? Thabazimbi municipal spokesman Joshua Motsomane said the community hijacked the houses before they were finished. He said government departments are working to come up with a solution. Approved beneficiaries like Samuel will have to be deregistered and apply for new houses.
