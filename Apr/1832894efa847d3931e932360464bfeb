THE pressure is on as the Absa Premiership title race  heads into the final straight. Defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns get the chance to draw level with leaders Orlando Pirates when they face struggling Black Leopards on Tuesday at Thohoyandou Stadium (7.30pm). Pirates are perched at the top of the table on 53 points with two games to play. Sundowns are breathing down their necks on 50 points with three matches remaining including the Leopards clash. Downs head coach Pitso Mosimane will be hoping his side can catch up to Bucs but the players will be leg weary when they arrive in Venda.Downs arrived home at the weekend after they were beaten 2-1 in their Caf Champions League, semifinal, first round clash against Moroccan giants Wydad Casablanca in Rabat last Friday night. With the title chase finely poised the title could be decided on goal difference if both title contenders win their remaining fixtures. Pirates have a plus 17 goal difference compared to Sundowns’ plus 12 goal difference. And despite the fact the Tshwane based Downs have been on the road to North Africa and now head north this time to Venda, Mosimane will be looking to not just collect three points but closing the goal difference on Bucs against a Leopards side that look to be losing the plot. Leopards head coach Dylan Kerr saw his side lose 2-1 at the same venue to bottom side Maritzburg United at the weekend. Mosimane will be hoping to take advantage of a home side that have been drawn into the relegation dog fight. Things are strained inside the Leopards camp with Kerr and goalkeeper King Ndlovu exchanging harsh words after that defeat. Morale is reported to be low after the loss to Maritzburg.Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic is also aware that goal difference could be vital in the remaining matches.
