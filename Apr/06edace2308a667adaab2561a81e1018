THE staff at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa,Tshwane, are gatvol of their working conditions. Their anger boiled over on Monday after machinery in the laundry room burnt down. They picketed inside the hospital on Tuesday and yesterday and demanded that CEO Dr Freddy Kgongwana be axed. They said they have been picketing every lunch break at the hospital for months. They said they have told management their safety was in danger. “After the fire broke out the manager sent us home without making sure we had not inhaled smoke,” claimed a worker. “Our kitchen is in the same condition as the laundry. The staff changing rooms are dirty and the toilet pipes are blocked,” said another worker. She claimed there were not enough beds in the psychology department. Gauteng Health spokesman Lesemang Matuka said the unions had raised a number of issues. “There was a meeting with Gauteng Health MEC Dr Gwen Ramokgopa and the HOD, Professor Mkhululi Lukhele on 11 April to fast track decisions around these issues.” He said some issues had been escalated to the Public Service Commission and the premier’s office. “We could only commit to co-operate in the investigations to ensure speedy resolutions,” he said.
