Cape Town City striker Kermit Erasmus received his marching orders in a 1-1 draw against Highlands Park for a wild kick on his opponent at the Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday. The Citizens were reduced to ten men as early as the 18th minute when Erasmus was shown a red card for a ridiculous kick on Mothobi Mvala. Mvala tried to stop the forward from taking a quick free-kick and Erasmus proceeded to lash out, striking the opposing player near the thigh with a swinging boot which left the referee no option but to send him off. The Lions of the North finally took advantage of being a man to the good when Ndoro pounced on a defensive error to slot past Peter Leeuwenburgh in the Cape Town City goal ten minutes after the half-time interval. City though fought back with Craig Martin executing a fine diving header in the 84th minute after a pin-point cross from Bradley Ralani to salvage a point.
