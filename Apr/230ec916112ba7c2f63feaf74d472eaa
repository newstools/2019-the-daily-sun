CAPE Town City coach Benni McCarthy was left frustrated by some of the decision against his side during their 1-1 draw with Highlands Park. The Citizens were forced to play most of the game with ten men after striker Kermit Erasmus received his marching orders as early as the 18th minute. The diminutive forward wildly kicked out at Mothobi Mvala who tried to stop the Citizens from taking a quick free kick.

But a spirited City outfit pulled level late to steal a point through winger Craig Martin. McCarthy, who was proud of his team’s efforts despite being a man down, was less than pleased with some of the officiating. Speaking to the media after the match, McCarthy also admitted that Erasmus showed a great lack of intelligence with his reaction, but stated that the striker had been provoked by the opponent. “It was a good game of football I think. We tried to make the most by going at them. Kermit, stupid reaction, [he was] provoked I would say but then you bite and you leave your team with 10 men. In the end, the guys fought,” said McCarthy.
