WHEN 13-year-old Kutlwano Tsoku saw the wall collapsing, he ran forward to push a grade R pupil out of the way. He saved the pupil but it cost him his life. He died of injuries at Gelukspan Hospital, near Mahikeng, North West on 10 April. The accident happened at Batho Batho Primary School in Mareetsane when Police Minister General Bheki Cele opened a new police station. The kids climbed on top of a wall to watch the opening of the cop shop next door. Kutlwanoâ€™s father, Frank, plans to sue the department. Cops have opened an inquest case. North West Education spokesman said officials visited the family to discuss arrangements and said the department will help where it can.
