GOOD leader Patricia De Lille has taken the DA to court. That’s because they refused to apologise for telling voters they fired her when in fact she had resigned. De Lille said she will not back down as the “lies” have damaged her name. “I will offer my services to the DA, I want to teach them how to tell the truth. I want them to know how to speak the truth,” said De Lille outside the Western Cape High Court yesterday afternoon. She appeared before Judge Robert Martin, who postponed the matter to Friday. “The DA continues to ignore the finding of the IEC, which instructed them to apologise to me,” she said. She said she’d experienced dirty politics from her former party in the past two weeks. “I fought them all the way and have won three or four cases. They did not even have the courtesy to respond to the lawyer’s letter I sent them. That’s how arrogant they are,” she said. Responding to accusations by the DA that she was taking them to court to gain political points, De Lille denied it. “We all know the DA are a bunch of blue liars. I don’t believe anybody still believes them,” she said. The DA’s Mike Moriarty said: “The basis for our court action is the hope that court will rule on whether or not the IEC can make instructions of a binding nature. Whether we’re right or wrong, the court will decide and we’ll be abide by the outcome of the court.”
