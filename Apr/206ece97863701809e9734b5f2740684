COPS were called on Monday after a mentally ill man (37) assaulted his 76-year-old gogo. The man was apparently so out of control that the Kagisanong cops in Mangaung couldn’t stop him, and they shot him dead at the scene. Resident Mothibi Mothupi said the man assaulted his gogo and cousin with stones. “I was walking from a vegetable stall when I saw the man pointing a knife at the cops and threatening to stab them. “No one could stop him. The man didn’t want to take his medication and was often a danger to his family and residents,” said Mothibi. He said he saw a cop being stabbed. Then a shot was fired and the man was on the ground. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said their investigators attended the crime scene in the evening. “The man allegedly assaulted his 76-year-old grandmother and the police were called. “He drew a knife on the police officers and stabbed a female officer in the hand. “A second blow landed on her bulletproof vest,” he said. “Another police officer fired shots hitting the man in the upper body but he allegedly kept on attacking. “A post mortem is taking place, no arrests have been made and investigations are ongoing.” He said Ipid would investigate the docket. The injured cop received medical attention and is getting counselling. “A firearm, cartridge cases and a projectile were handed over to the Criminal Records Centre’s officer at the scene. ”
