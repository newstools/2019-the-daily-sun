IT’S squeaky-bum time! And Orlando Pirates are certainly not blinking, focusing fully on the big prize. The Buccaneers restored their three-point lead at the top of the Absa Premiership with a narrow 1-0 win over relegation-haunted Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium last night. Vincent Pule poked home from metres out to in the 67th minute to sent the packed stadium into ruptures. The Buccaneers are now on 53 points, there ahead of closest rivals Mamelodi Sundowns, who have a game in hand, being away on Caf Champions League assignment in Morocco. However, it wasn’t the easiest of victories for the Soweto giants, who have to strain every sinew of their being to grind out results. Equally under pressure to starve off relegation, Maritzburg came into the game looking to get closer to fellow relegation-haunted side Chippa United and Baroka FC on 23 points. But they could not get through a resolute Bucs side, keen on restoring their lead. Bongokuhle Hlongwane proved to be a menace for the Bucs defence and actually came close to scoring on the half-hour mark. But it was Bucs who found the opener through Pule, who had a blinder. Quicksilver winger Pule got the last touch to direct the ball into the net after Luvuyo Memela’s shot deflected off Brian Onyango. Justin Shonga could have found the lead early in the second half, as Bucs pumped up the pressure on the home side. And it looked as though Pirates would away frustrated, having put so much effort into the match. But in the end, Pule’s strike was enough to earn Bucs a massive win. This title race is certainly going down to the wire.
