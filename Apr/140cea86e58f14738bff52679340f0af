OVER 42
people were injured when a bus overturned on the N3 highway on the Chatterton
Off-ramp in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal. ER24’s
spokesperson Russel Meiring said when they arrived on scene, paramedics found a
large bus lying on its left side on a small embankment. The trailer
it had reportedly been towing was still attached to the bus. “A triage
area was set up to allow paramedics to tend to the numerous patients found
walking around on the scene,” Meiring said. According
to Meiring paramedics assessed the patients and found that 42 people had
sustained minor to moderate injuries.  He added
that fortunately, no serious injuries or fatalities were found. “The
patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to
various hospitals in the area for further treatment,” he said.  The details
surrounding this incident are not yet known but local authorities were on the
scene for further investigations
