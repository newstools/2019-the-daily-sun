INSTEAD of celebrating Easter, Patrick Oneke’s family was mourning his tragic death. The 23-year-old from Delft, Cape Town, was murdered by thugs who robbed him of his cellphone. His mum, Mado Bimiswa, said Patrick was last seen leaving his father’s salon. “I’m hurt that my son died this way because he was a good person with a great character.” Witnesses said Patrick was attacked by two men with knives and a toy gun. When the thugs tried to rob Patrick, he resisted. “They stabbed him in the neck, took his phone and ran away,” said a witness. The thugs apparently left the toy gun on the scene, leaving Patrick to bleed to death. When cops arrived on the scene, he was still alive, but died from his wounds a few minutes later. Patrick’s father Huruma Rukubanuk said: “I spent the day with him at the salon. I didn’t know he was going to die. I’m in so much pain.” Police spokesman Captain Fredrick van Wyk said a murder case was opened.
