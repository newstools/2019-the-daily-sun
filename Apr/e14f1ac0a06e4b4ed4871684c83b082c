FOUR people including a 12-year-old girl have died in the Eastern Cape amid floods and overflowing rivers. Premier Phumulo Masualle visited Greens Farm and Mpantu Village in Port St Johns yesterday. “It’s clear we are sitting with a disaster,” said Masualle. Masualle is waiting for a report which will give an estimate of the damage for necessary emergency measures. “The damage is too big. The damage could increase as days go by and we can’t say definitely how much damage was caused,” said Masualle. Meanwhile, mayor Nomvuzo Mlombile-Cingo said they had long-term plans to move Greens Farm residents. “But the issue is that the land belongs to the people of Caguba location. Half of the land of this town belongs to them, but we are in talks,” she said. “We want to move people to secure areas. We want to thank the people who supported us. Residents have three meals a day, showing the magnitude of the support.” An account has been opened for donors who’d like to help the residents. While some residents have remained in their homes, hundreds others are still seeking refuge in the town hall. The rain and floods have since died down.
