PATRICE Motsepe flashed a wide grin as Mamelodi Sundowns hit the 50-point mark with a hard-fought 3-2 Absa Premiership win here on Tuesday. The Sundowns president wished his boys well as they prepared to travel to Morocco on Tuesday night for their Caf Champions League semifinal tie against Wydad Casablanca on Friday.But most importantly, they have maintained their league title challenge. Chasing a double this season, the Brazilians can’t afford to drop the ball in either the Absa Premiership or in the Caf Champions League. And they demonstrated their ability do battle on two fronts as they edged Chippa United 3-2 here yesterday. They are now equal on 50 points with the Buccaneers as the campaign winds down to a close. But the Soweto giants could restore their lead when they visit relegation-troubled Maritzburg United tonight. Pressure is back on Micho’s side, with Sundowns now sitting just below them like a bird of prey waiting for the right moment pounce.However, it wasn’t an easy victory for Sundowns, who had to ride out a storm towards the end. Chippa started brightly, continuing their commendable battle to survive relegation.And they had the perfect start when Mark Mayambela turned expertly before rifling in the opener in the 25th minute. But Hlompho Kekana grabbed the equalised three minutes before the interval. With Gaston Sirino back from suspension to conduct the Downs’ orchestra, the Brazilians took full control of proceedings, taking the lead for the first time through Sibusiso Vilakazi’s goal in the 56th minute. Sirino also grabbed his fourth of the season sublime finish in the 68th minute.But there was a nervous end to the match after Rhulani Manzini scored the second for Chippa.
