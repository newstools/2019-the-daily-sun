South African Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk has withdrawn from the ASA Senior Championships at Germiston Athletics Stadium. Van Niekerk confirmed the news on Twitter during the opening day on Thursday. "Was looking forward to competing again on home soil after a good build-up but the weather isn't playing along so we don't want to take any chances," wrote Van Niekerk. Rain and lightning interrupted the morning session on day one of the ASA Senior Championships, but the action soon commenced at 11:00. The meet would've been particularly significant one for Van Niekerk as he continues his recovery from a long-term knee injury which sidelined him from October 2017 all the way through until February this year. Van Niekerk, however concluded that he would get ready for his next international event. "I look forward to representing SA on the international circuit," he added. Meanwhile, Olympic champions Caster Semenya and Luvo Manyonga are among the star athletes performing in the three-day championships, which ends on Sunday.
