FORTY-TWO suspects were arrested for various crimes in Ekurhuleni
over the Easter Weekend. The operation was conducted by Katlehong Crime Prevention and
Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department. Roadblocks were conducted on various roads around Katlehong. Motorists who broke traffic laws were issued with fines, but most
were arrested for drunk driving. Katlehong police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe told Daily Sun other suspects were arrested
for assault, possession of suspected stolen goods, possession of suspected
stolen motor vehicle, shoplifting, reckless driving and housebreaking and
theft. He said a 29-year-old man was arrested on Monday for possession of
firearm without a valid license. “He was arrested in Khumalo Valley in Katlehong. Katlehong Crime
Prevention were allegedly patrolling Khumalo Valley when they saw two men
walking along the street who looked suspicious,” he said. Ndobe said when police stopped to search the men, they then ran
away. “Police gave chase on foot and grabbed one suspect. He was
searched and a 9mm pistol with eight rounds of ammunition was found in his
possession,” said Ndobe. He said the serial number of the firearm was filled off. “The firearm will be taken to ballistics to investigate whether it
was used to commit a crime. The suspect was detained at the Katlehong Police
Station,” he said. Meanwhile police arrested a 34-year-old man in Florida on Monday
and found drugs hidden in a stove. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said the
intelligence driven operation by members of Joburg CIS and Westrand K9 led to
the arrest. “Police got information early this month and were doing
observations,” he said. He said they searched the flat and found a plastic bag in the
stove with drugs worth thousands of Rands. “The arrested suspect will appear in Roodepoort Magistrates Court
today (Wednesday),” he said.
