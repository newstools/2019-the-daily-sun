CAPE Town City and Highlands Park played out to a 1-1 draw in their Absa Premiership clash at the Cape Town Stadium on Tuesday. Tendai Ndoro’s strike was cancelled out by Craig Martin’s diving header as the two sides eventually settled for a share of the spoils. The draw was Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba’s 14th of the season, the most by any team in the league. And it would have been a better result for them than it was for the Citizens. The Lions of the North are now beginning to solidify their spot in the top eight, while the Capetonians are falling out of the title race, slowly but surely. Benni McCarthy’s charges will need something special now to clinch their maiden title. They were on the back foot early in the match after Kermit Erasmus was given his marching orders early in the game. Substitute Ndoro gave Highlands the lead in the 56th minute when he got through on goal and calmly slotted past City keeper Peter Leeuwenburgh. But City winger Martin equalised in the 84th minute with a diving header. The Citizens next travel to Port Elizabeth to face struggling Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Friday while Highlands host Polokwane City at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday.
