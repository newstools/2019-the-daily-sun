THEY say coaches at Chippa United don’t sleep a wink. They take their bag with them whenever they travel for games… in case the dreaded axe falls on them. But incumbent mentor Clinton Larsen is not having any sleepless nights, fretting over his job. The under-pressure Larsen reckons he is doing a fine job helping the team starve off relegation. Chippa slipped further into the PSL relegation mire after losing 2-0 to Cape Town City on Friday night. They are four points off the bottom, occupying 15th position with 24 points. Knowing Chippa Mpengesi, Larsen could soon find himself in the unemployment queue. However, Larsen insists his boss is happy with the progress the club has been making under his guidance. “Some people said I shouldn’t unpack my bags. They said I won’t last a month. Well, I’ve been here for four months,” said Larsen. “He is very happy with my work. At the end of the day all I do is my best. I think everybody can see the work I’ve done since I took over. And just to let you know, in the 17 games before I took over, the four coaches (previous) accumulated 12 points. I got 12 points in nine games. So, it does not take rocket science to see there is improvement in performance and results.” But the biggest challenge will be overcoming Kaizer Chiefs who they face in their last league match on 11 May. “My team keeps fighting,” added Larsen. “I’d like to get the job done in those two games. You don’t want to leave it until the last day. We’ve got players coming back from suspension, with the likes of Gladwin Shitolo, Frederic Nsabiyumva and Zitha Macheke.” Larsen added pressure was part and parcel of the job.
