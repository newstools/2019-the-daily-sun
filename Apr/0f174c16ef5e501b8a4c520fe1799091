KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says there is no chance that goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune will be fit to play for Bafana Bafana at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Khune is currently nearly five months into his six-month recovery period from a shoulder injury that prematurely brought an end to his 2018/19 season in December. His injury required surgery and he has since started rehabilitation on the condition. However, Middendorp is adamant that the star keeper will not be ready in time for the Afcon in Egypt. The Afcon is scheduled to start fromÂ 21 June until 19 July in fourt Cities of Egypt. Bafana will take part in the tournament and are in a tough Group D along with Morocco, Namibia and the Ivory Coast. As such, there were hopes that Khune may make an early return to international duty. The German told reporters: "Ja, let's be honest, today is nearly the end of April, and until now he has not even trained with any ball involved at all. " I think, actually, it should not really be that every three weeks I have to answer this question. "But there is no chance, 100%, if somebody dreams about having Itu Khune at Afcon, when he is not even at training. "Sorry, it is totally not serious, it is dishonest. "And secondly, he should really make it happen to be very concentrated and clear-structured to prepare himself to have a good start of the [2019-20] season. "We have Bruce Bvuma and we have Daniel Akpeyi who are getting more and more settled in, they are definitely goalkeepers who have a high quality competitive level. "That's my opinion. But if the national team coach (Stuart Baxter) has an idea to call in Itu Khune for Afcon, that's his decision. "Our medical department definitely has other ideas."
