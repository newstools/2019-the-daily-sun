SOCIAL media has gone crazy over wax sculptor and painter Lungelo Gumede’s work. Lungelo’s paintings of famous Hollywood celebrities have earned him praise. He paints celebrities in traditional Zulu attire! Some of the celebrities he painted include Denzel Washington, Angelina Jolie, Eddie Murphy, Jay Z and former United States president Barack Obama. Some social media users have even suggested he give Rasta tips! Speaking to Daily Sun, the Durban-based artist said his paintings were inspired by the celebrities’ African roots. Lungelo said he had an exhibition in Hollywood in 2016, where he showcased his artwork. It was a one-man show, he said, and the response was positive. “It meant so much to me because I wasn’t expecting attendance from the celebrities that came,” he said. Lungelo did paintings of boxer Floyd Mayweather, Dr Dre, Queen Latifah, Whoopi Goldberg and John Legend.  “I felt very honoured to be appreciated,” he said. When social media suggested he give Rasta a tip, he said he wished to meet Rasta. “We all start somewhere. Before I travelled the world, there was a time when I’d go to the mall, take my stuff and draw – and at the time nobody knew me.”
