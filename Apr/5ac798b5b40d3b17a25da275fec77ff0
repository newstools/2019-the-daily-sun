Two buses burst into flames in two different incidents in
Cape Town in this afternoon. A Golden Arrow bus burnt down around 2pm at a rank in the
CBD. While a MyCiti bus caught fire at Nelson Mandela Boulevard
around 5pm just outside the city centre. In both incidents’ officials say they are investigating the
matter, but it looks like both buses had a mechanical failure. Jarmaine Carelse City Fire and Rescue department said: “Fire
Fighters were called out at 14:22 to a bus alight in Castle Street, Cape Town
CBD. Currently there are three fire engines, a rescue vehicle abd 17 staff on
scene battling the blaze. The fire has been contained. No injuries have been
reported and the cause of the fire is unknown.” Golden Arrow spokeswoman Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said: “The Fire
Department was on the scene very quickly and the fire was extinguished. At this
stage the cause of the fire is unknown, but it does not appear to be related to
vandalism. We will conduct a thorough investigation to determine the
cause. No injuries were reported.” On the MyCiti bus Carelse said: “Fire Fighters were called
out to a MyCity bus alight just before 5 this evening on Nelson Mandela
Boulevard, incoming lane. Two fire engines, a rescue vehicle and 12 staff
members were dispatched. Currently the fire fighters are on scene utilizing two fog
jets to contain this fire. No injuries have been reported.” Jean-Pierre Smith
the Mayco member of Safety and Security said: “ The fire started from the engine compartment and quickly
engulfed the whole bus. Commuters who use Golden Arrow and MyCiti said their fear is
to get home late. “When these kinds of incidents happen, it delays many other
buses but at least it looks like today, the delay is slight,” said Mandisa
Vikilahle from Khayelitsha.
