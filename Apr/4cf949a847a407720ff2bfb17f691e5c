LOOKING for
jobs will no longer require you to have work experience. “You will
get experience on the job!” This is
what ANC Head of Elections FIkile Mbalula told residents of Duduza in
Ekurhuleni during a community meeting shortly after a door-to-door campaign in
the area. In less
than two weeks people of Mzanzi will be heading to the polls to casts their
votes. Promises
and commitments will be heard more often as the country heads to the most
anticipated national elections. Mbalula
also told the scores of residents that Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina, will
give them land to build their own houses. “Mzwandile
is working in Ekurhuleni, not Herman Mashaba and Mmusi Maimane with his small
pants.” “Mzwandile
is going to give you land so that you can build,” he said. As most
political parties are looking to snatch supporters from other parties, Mbalula
urged the ANC supporters in Duduza not to give in to opposition parties. He also reminded
them of some of the things the ANC had done for South Africans, such as social
grants and RPD houses. “ANC has
worked and there is a lot that we still need to do.” He said
some people say they don’t see what the ANC is doing, but they are occupying
RPD houses, “Some say
we don’t know what the ANC is doing, but they are beneficiaries of social grants.  He also
urged residents to go out in numbers and vote for them because they don’t want
to rely on Julius Malema’s EFF in coalition. Masina said
they have identified some of the things that the ANC is doing wrong in the
region and they need to correct that. Yesterday
he said he was addressing the issue of land in Etwatwa, where residents told
him that they want land so they can build their own houses.
