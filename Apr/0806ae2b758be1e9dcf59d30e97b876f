SABC summer song winner Master KG has promised to perform for "mahala" (without charging a fee) for his fans after he failed to pitch at a gig at the The Tees Life Style in Springfield village outside Bochum, Limpopo. He was expected to perform on Saturday night but never came. In a video making rounds on social media, Master KG apologized to his fans for not coming to the event. "I was supposed to come there and perform but due to unforeseen circumstances I didn't manage. After my performance somewhere, we had tyres problem as we had hit potholes. I apologize for that to my beautiful fans who bought tickets to support me." "I know I have disappointed you and I will come soon and perform for you and entrance will be free. I will make it up to you." Master KG.
