TWO UDM volunteers who were moered by their ANC counterparts last month dropped the charges yesterday. Three UDM volunteers opened a case of assault against ANC ward committee member Tsepo Hlabe and his brother Gobo after they allegedly attacked them while campaigning at Khaleni Village, west of Mthatha. The Mbizana Magistrates Court dropped two counts of assault against the accused after the parties agreed. Simon Zikizela (70) was allegedly manhandled and ridiculed by young men belonging to the ANC. The prosecutor said Simon’s complaint was not dropped as he was not before court. Nomgqibelo Celwane (35) and Phelokazi Ndlovu (22) were slapped and beaten. They both confirmed in court they were dropping the charges. Nomgqibelo said she was tired of the drama. “I can’t be going up and down for this. Villagers keep pointing fingers at me and giving me bad looks,” she said. Phelokazi said her family told her to drop the charges. “The Hlabes spoke with my family and apologised. I was pressured into dropping the whole thing. “Being in court is a terrifying experience and I won’t cope without support from my family,” she said. Tsepo told the court he did not bother looking for an attorney. “I thought the charges would be dropped. I’m surprised there are still charges remaining,” he said. The case against the accused was postponed to 30 April.
