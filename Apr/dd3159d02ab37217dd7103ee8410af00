ABOUT 12 000 Tshwane residents were expected to march to the Union Buildings on Monday. But only a few people participated. Authorities said the planned march to deliver a memorandum of grievances was unauthorised. Even the South African National Taxi Council distanced itself from #TshwaneShutDown after some members were said to be taking part. Organisers claimed their shut down was sabotaged by councillors as their issues were caused by them. Residents who travelled from various Tshwane kasis arrived in Marabastaad in buses but instead of marching as planned, they changed their minds and opted to be driven to the Union Buildings. They said it was too hot to march. Leader of the shutdown, Jomo Rapholo, said although the Metro police refused to authorise the march, that wouldn’t stop them from fighting for what they wanted. Their grievances included title deeds, street lights, clean water and the removal of potholes. Sinah Tlolo (68) said she was tired of waiting for an RDP house. The protesters said they won’t vote in the election as there was currently no party good enough to rule them.
