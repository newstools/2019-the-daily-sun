MPUMALANGA Education MEC Sibusiso Malaza has called on communities to work together to support boy children. Mbatha (16) was allegedly raped and killed by a fellow pupil on Monday two weeks ago. The following day, her parents searched for her in the area, without success. But they learned that she was last seen with Calvin Chiloane (17) after the study session on that fateful day. Her body was discovered buried in a shallow grave in the back yard of Chiloane’s house. Chiloane has since committed suicide while in jail by hanging himself with his school shirt. Malaza said the community must work together to build the boy child as this was a societal matter. “I always put an emphasis on how we are raising a boy child because I have realised that there is a gap and all these negative behavioural patterns you see are being displayed done by boys,” he said. “The things that are happening in our schools reveals the conditions we are living under in our communities. The violence and anger show us that there is something that we are not doing right in our communities. We need to fix our communities, our problems are within our societies and if we don’t fix them, we will continue to have situations like this,” he said. He called on men and absent fathers to take part and take charge in raising their sons. Mbatha’s aunt, Louisa Mabote, said this was a great loss for the family because they have never thought that it would happen. “We don’t have strength... , we can’t do anything, and we hope God will take us through this ordeal and . They have caused us an this unbearable pain,” she said.
