COPS are looking for a green Toyota Tazz with no plates after a mum was killed on her return from a maintenance court hearing. The 57-year-old woman was shot and killed outside her gate in Mancoe Street, Kagisanong, in Mangaung last Thursday afternoon. Her traumatised family could not speak to the SunTeam. “This is very sad as the family was probably looking forward to enjoying the Easter weekend together. “I heard three gun shots which terrified me. I hope the suspects get caught,” said a neighbour. A cop said: “The woman filed for child maintenance at the Bloemfontein court. On Thursday, her case was due to be heard. “But the man she took to court did not show up. He sent a doctor’s certificate to say he was at a consultation and the case was not heard.” Mangaung police spokeswoman Sergeant Precious Hlubi confirmed the incident. Hlubi said: “Kagisanong police are investigating a murder. A woman was shot dead outside her home. She was shot three times in the head, cheek and neck. The suspects were driving a green Toyota Tazz with no registration number. No one has been arrested yet.” Anyone with information is urged to contact Lieutenant- Colonel Thapelo Mojanaga at 082 467 6177 or Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or report to the nearest cop shop.
