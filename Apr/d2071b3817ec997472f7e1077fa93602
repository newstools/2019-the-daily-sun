“Everyone coming and saying we were fraudulently registered is working to suppress democracy" These are the words by African Transformation Movement (ATM) President Vuyolwethu Zungula. Zungula was addressing members of the media at a press conference in Parktown on Thursday morning. Zungula said that there are no splinter groups just individuals working to cause confusion. Zungula said that any confusion about there being an ATC or ATM came about during the election process. "We were going to register the party as the African Transformation Congress (ATC). The IEC said that there too many parties with a combination of African and Congress in their name and we had to find an alternative," Zungula said. Zungula accused Buyisile Ngqulwana, the secretary-general of the South African Council of Messianic Churches in Christ (SACMCC) of working with the ANC, after he wrote to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), asking that the ATM be deregistered for the election. The party also welcomed members from Agang and COPE. They welcomed former Agang leader Michael Tshishonga and Princess Manzana Themba Nakumba from COPE. Tshishonga was expelled from Agang after being accused of misappropriating party funds. Tshishonga said that he joins the ATM because it is the only party that is preaching peace. ATM President Zungula said that the allegations against Tshishonga were unfounded. He said that the party welcomes everyone even people who've made mistakes but are willing to transform we'll be accepted into the ATM. Zungula also talked about how private funding encourages corruption. “No company will give political party money and expect nothing in return,” Zungula said. He said that ATM hasn’t received any funding from private donors. “We don’t owe anyone money. We don't anyone any favours,” Zungula said. Zungula said that the macro-economy should be reserved for South Africans. He said that it is currently owned by foreigners and they are not paying taxes.
