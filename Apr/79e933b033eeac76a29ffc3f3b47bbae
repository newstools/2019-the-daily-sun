HE ALLEGEDLY raped Jane Saul (44) from Thubelisha, Thabong in Welkom earlier this year but she dropped the charges. But after Jane was found dead on Tuesday, the man was bust. The dead woman’s neighbour Puleng Litabe (58) said she went out to sweep her yard when she saw a person’s feet around the corner of the house. “I ran back into the house and looked through the window to see a dead person on the ground. I called the neighbours and we found it was Jane. The image of her body will haunt me forever. The man who did this is evil and must rot in jail.” Apparently, the dead woman’s intestines were hanging from a tree and her heart was lying next to her body. Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said: “A 32-year-old suspect has been arrested and charged with murder after Jane’s half-naked body was found with stab wounds and her intestines cut out.” She said Thabong police and the Welkom K9 unit began a manhunt. Detectives followed up on information that led them to Dr MG Mngoma Primary School, where they bust a 32-year-old street vendor. They found clothing full of blood at his house. “The suspect will appear in court soon,” Mokhuoane said.
