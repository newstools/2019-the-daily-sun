THEY live with disabilities but are not waiting for handouts. This group works with iron and aluminium to make sliding doors, gates, windows and railings. They are based at Tsholetsa Disability Centre in Tlhabane, near Rustenburg in the North West. They also collect old tyres to make sofas. At first they only focused on art, but as time went by they started a garden project. They have brick-making machines but need money to buy sand and cement. Their chairman Richard Tlhogoe told Daily Sun: “It’s a challenge to transport finished goods to customers. “We don’t have transport. We struggle to visit big businesses to market our products. “For now customers who visit us see our products, give us their specifications for orders, and collect their orders.” He said they hoped more people could visit the centre so that they can make a living. They were grateful to the lottery board for its R190 000 donation.
