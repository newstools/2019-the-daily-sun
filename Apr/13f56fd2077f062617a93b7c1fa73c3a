KABELO Moloto (28) would possibly still be alive if the hospital hadn’t kept him waiting, his family claims. Kabelo was admitted to the Moses Kotane Hospital in Ledig, near Rustenburg in North West on 24 February. His car had broken down and a speeding car allegedly hit his car before hitting Kabelo. His right leg was broken in two places. Kabelo’s uncle, Frans Mogale said the driver seemed drunk but police never tested him for alcohol. Mogale said: “The accident happened at about 10pm. The police came at about midnight or 1am. Kabelo waited at Moses Kotane Hospital till 5pm before being transferred to Job Shimankane Tabane Hospital in Rustenburg,” said Mogale. Kabelo signed to have his broken leg amputated but he later had breathing problems and vomited up blood. On 1 March, after his leg was amputated, he died. Mogale said nurses told him the infection had spread to other parts of the body because he was not attended to on time at Moses Kotane. “Now we want answers. The department of health must take full responsibility for this,” he said. Department spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said the matter was being investigated, and they will find out what happened at the two hospitals. Cops confirmed a case of culpable homicide but said details were different from the family’s version. Colonel Adele Myburgh said the case is under investigation and they need to obtain witness statements. Myburgh said the taking of blood at an accident was not compulsory. “It is based on a reasonable suspicion that a person may be under the influence of alcohol,” she said.
