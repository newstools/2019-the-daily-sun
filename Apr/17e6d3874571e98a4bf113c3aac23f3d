SAMUEL Lefoka (55) from Mosesetjana in Mokopane, Limpopo loves birds so much he even speaks to them. Samuel has been breeding birds for 25 years. “Birds need socialising, just like humans,” he said. “I hold them and talk to them. They respond to whistles, chirps and bird talk,” he said. Samuel takes care of more than 2 000 birds at Birds and Pets Africa. His favourite bird is the Blue Gold Macaw. “It is a kind bird and it learns quickly,” said Samuel. He also loves the African Grey but said the male birds hate men and the female birds hate women. Samuel’s day starts at 8am. He feeds the birds, cleans their cages and checks if any of his charges are sick. “It’s not always easy to see. It takes experience to notice their signs and symptoms. During the day I work as a salesman and help customers who want to buy the birds.” He advises people about the care of birds, including choosing the right cage and food, and watching the bird’s health. Samuel keeps his birds safe at all times.
