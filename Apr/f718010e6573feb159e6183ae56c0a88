 The
Mokopane Regional Court has sentenced a baby snatcher to eight years in jail. Anna
Matjila aged 18 appeared before the Mokopane Regional Court on a charge of
child stealing. After
her first appearance on the 15th April 2019 where she was denied bail, her case
was heard again on Tuesday and she was ultimately sentenced to eight years
imprisonment. Police
spokesperson constable Maphure Manamela said the case against her boyfriend
aged 23, was withdrawn pending further police investigations. He
said the duo was arrested at Ga-Mphela Village outside Polokwane by a high-level
Task Team during a sting joint operation conducted in Polokwane and the
surrounding areas on 13 April 2019. The
kidnapped child was also found in their custody unharmed. This
followed an intensive search operation by the police after Matlatjie allegedly
stole a six-week-old baby boy at Mokopane shopping centre on 28 March 2019. It
is alleged that a 24-year-old mother met an unknown woman in the shopping
center and thereafter, walked with her while shopping. The
suspect offered to hold the baby so that the mother could eat. Later on, they
went to another supermarket. The
suspect disappeared with the infant, without the mother noticing.
