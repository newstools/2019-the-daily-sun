World Boxing Super Series (WBSS) semi-final’s late replacement Stephon “Showstopper” Young said he is ready to give his all when he clash with Filipino legendary boxer Nonito Donaire at Cajune Dome in Lafayette Sunday morning (SA time). The American fighter replaced the South African boxing hero Zolani Tete who suffered a shoulder injury three days before the championship contest. Tete, a WBO bantamweight champion was scheduled to unify with Donaire who holds the WBA super and WBC Diamond titles. “It doesn’t matter who I fight. I’m coming in to win vs anyone I step in there with. My mindset is strong. I have the utmost respect for Nonito. He is a great fighter and from what I see he’s a classy fighter outside the ring as well. “I feel I will handle the big stage quite well and I rate my chances very, very good.” “I was walking in circles for ten minutes eyes full of tears of joy. I felt amazing with the news,“ said Young about receiving the news that he is entering the World Boxing Super Series. “It’s a real dream come true to be in this position.” According to the competition’s chief boxing officer Kalle Sauerland the No 5 WBA ranked Young was already on standby as a reserve and fighting in the co-feature on the undercard against Daniel Lozano. And he will now have the golden opportunity to earn a place in the final against either Naoya Inoue or Emmanuel Rodriguez in the final.
