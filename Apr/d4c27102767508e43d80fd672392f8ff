POLITICIANS took their campaigns to various churches in Mzansi over the Easter weekend. President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC KZN chairman Sihle Zikalala visited the Nazareth Church in Ekuvukeni, KZN on Saturday. Deputy president David Mabuza attended a church service at the ZCC in Moria, north of Polokwane in Limpopo on Sunday. Mabuza was visiting the church for the second time. His visit formed part of the ANC’s campaign before the election. Mabuza later shared a moment with Bishop Engenas Lekganyane. EFF leader Julius Malema was also at Moria on Sunday. On Facebook, Malema said: “I was at St Engenas ZCC church service in Moria with the outgoing deputy president DD Mabuza and outgoing Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha. They were telling me how they trained me in the ANC from Cosas level. Beyond politics we are friends, we meet, laugh and drink whiskeys together and advice each other. If we at the top can do it, why are you fighting each other?” On Sunday, the Mnceba Methodist Church in KwaBhaca, in the Eastern Cape, welcomed ANC treasurer general Paul Mashatile. In Gauteng, DA leader Mmusi Maimane visited Grace Bible Church in Soweto on Sunday, while Cope president Mosiuoa Lekota was at the Bethlehem St Michael’s Faith Mission Apostolic Church in Mabopane. DA Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga was at the Rock of Salvation Church in Meadowlands, Soweto, while African Content Movement leader Hlaudi Motsoeneng was at the AME Church in Thaba Nchu.
