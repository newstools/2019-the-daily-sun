THE Mthatha High Court has sentenced muthi killer Olwethu Mbalwa (32) to life in prison. The court, sitting in Mbizana on Thursday, found Mbalwa guilty of murder, breaking and entering and robbery with aggravated circumstances. Mbalwa killed 18-year-old Sinoyolo Mgaga at her home in October 2017. He beheaded her and removed her private parts and then buried her head in a bucket with muthi. He kept her private parts in a glass jar for muthi to make himself and his clients rich. During his appearance last Monday, Mbalwa claimed cops had forced him to confess and lied about him showing them where the body parts were hidden. However, Judge Buyiswa Majiki said his confession included details of the murder the police could not have known about. Majiki said she had to dismiss the evidence that he pointed out the grave site because the proper procedures were not followed, but other evidence informed her decision to find him guilty on all charges. Sinoyolo’s mum Nomthunzi said she believed her sister was involved in the murder. “I am hoping one day my sister explains why my child was killed,” she said.
