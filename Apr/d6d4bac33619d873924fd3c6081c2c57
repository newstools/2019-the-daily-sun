NOZALISEKO Matwa (67) bought her house in 1997. But she only lived in the house for a few months. Gogo Nozaliseko of Mvubu Street, Motherwell, Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun when it was being built, she picked up lots of empty alcohol bottles in her yard. “I later found out the builders were drinking while building my house. The roof started to collapse the same year. They should have repaired the house,” she said. Nozaliseko, who lives with her son and grandchild, said they have been living in the front of the house during the day and sleeping at neighbours’ houses at night. Community members intervened and Councillor Mambalu Mgcokoca sourced R3 500 to buy roofing material. Resident Chuma Tokota said he, Mgcokoca and Max Qandana raised R1 000 each while other residents assisted with additional material. “Motherwell Hardware gave us the material at a good discount,” said Chuma. Andile Mfunda, Nelson Mandela Bay municipal head of human settlements, told Daily Sun: “I admire the role played by the community. We will ensure there is official recognition of the house.”
