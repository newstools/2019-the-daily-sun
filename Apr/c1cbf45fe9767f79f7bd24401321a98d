The battle between Public Enterprises Mnnister Pravin Gordhan and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane intensifies. This was after Mkhwebane granted Gordhan an extension until 3 May to submit the affidavit and evidence he was expected to provide. Gordhan is being investigated for allegations of improper conduct, a violation of ethics code and irregular and unlawful activities. This relates to allegations that he established a rogue unit while he was serving as the South African Revenue Services Commissioner. Gordhan was given less than a fortnight to provide Mkhwebane’s office with the requested information. Mkhwebane, in a statement released on Tuesday, accused Gordhan of colluding with other implicated parties on how they should answer the questions surrounding the alleged rogue intelligence unit. Mkhwebane also claimed that Gordhan approached her for the extension on Monday, after the Easter Holidays. However, Gordhan hit back, claiming that Mkhwebane had failed to respond to a letter from him. Gordhan also denied that he had approached her on Monday for the extension. “"We take serious issue with any suggestion by the Public Protector that there was collusion by ‘implicated parties who were served with subpoenas’ to coordinate how our client responds to her office," the minister's office said. "These unfortunate remarks, in her statement to the media earlier today, have no basis in fact and represent conjecture which impugns on the Office of the Public Protector.” "Minister Gordhan has not met with any person subpoenaed by the Public Protector nor with any official of the South African Revenue Service in relation to the subpoena issued by the Public Protector. Gordhan’s office also said that they will be challenging the Public Protector to provide the factual basis for the statement suggesting that Gordhan is acting in concert with others and why he is referred to as an implicated party.
