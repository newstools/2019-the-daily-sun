COPS are looking for the driver who smashed into a group of cyclists on the R55 near the Zwartkops Raceway in Centurion, Tshwane on Friday. His vehicle apparently ploughed into the group and killed one of them. After the accident, the driver apparently fled on foot, leaving a passenger behind. Constable Tumisang Moloto said police are investigating a case of culpable homicide and reckless driving. “The incident happened just after 6am on the R55 near the race course. “When police arrived on the scene, one person was declared dead while four others, including the passenger in the white Toyota Tazz, sustained injuries and were taken to a local hospital for treatment. “The driver was not found on the scene. We appeal to people to assist the police to locate him.” Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Charles Mabaso confirmed the incident. “One cyclist was certified dead on the scene and four others sustained moderate to serious injuries, while 13 had light injuries. “The driver of the vehicle that ran over the cyclists could not be found. He left the vehicle with a passenger in it,” he said.
