It is believed that Cleopatra may have been one of the first women to have a vibrator. Hers would have been a calabash filled with buzzing bees. We’ve come a long way since then even in terms of design, but perhaps socially and psychologically we have in fact regressed. Speaking to 7 men, who are between the ages of 25 and 40 four of them confessed to being offended. In committed relationships, it is important to consider your partner's feelings and the fact that a vibrator poses a risk of replacing your partner according to the men we spoke to. In the past, Roman and Greek philosophers and healers from as early as the 4th century wrote much about the idea of ‘hysteria’ in women. Hysteria was considered to be a disease of the womb which caused irritability, discomfort and a general malaise.Today we would just call it sexual frustration. For over a thousand years, the most common treatment for hysteria was therapeutic genital massage. Four of the ones who were completely against the idea said that using a vibrator only means they can't do what they are supposed to in bed while one said that "I don't think I can be replaced by a toy because I believe the human touch is very powerful but however it would worry me if I can't satisfy my woman." "Actually one should encourage to bring toys into the bed to spice up their sex life." said the one who did not feel offended and the other one added that there's nothing wrong as long as there's a common understanding and agreement regarding its importance in the relationship. That being said, nobody wants to feel replaced by a toy. If you start turning him down for sex for some vibrator time, it could build resentment. Generally, I would say that toys are a welcome addition to the bedroom.
