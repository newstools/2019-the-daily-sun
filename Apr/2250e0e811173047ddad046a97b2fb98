 Another crash left kids injured on Wednesday morning. Seven
children were left injured this morning following a rear-end collision between
two cars and a taxi on Klassie Havenga Street in Sasolburg. ER24’s Russel
Mering said paramedics arrived on the scene to find the three vehicles parked
on the side of the road. Several
children were found walking around the scene. “Paramedics
assessed the patients and found that seven children aged between 6 and 12, had
sustained minor to moderate injuries,” he said. Fortunately,
no serious injuries or fatalities were found. The
children were treated and thereafter transported them to nearby provincial
hospitals for further care.
