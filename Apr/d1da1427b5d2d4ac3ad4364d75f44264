WHEN Carriage Lubisi sees overgrown grass, he sees a chance to make money. The 49-year-old from extension 11 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun: “Life can be unfair but we have to make the best of it. I saw an opportunity to cut grass and it’s working for me. “I do it for residents but can’t do it for free. “I need to support my family.” The father of seven has 10 lawnmowers and hires two people to help. But he said he wasn’t making enough money working for individuals and wanted to get company contracts. “I want to see my 10 lawnmowers turning my life into gold so I can live like other happy families in my area.” Carriage hopes one day the municipality will hire him to cut grass in the area. “I hope the machines will turn my life around. I’m suffering. Please help me to improve my community but also to put something on the table,” he said. Carriage said he brought change to his community by clearing the bush where thugs who terrorise residents hide. Acting Tshwane mayoral spokesman Norman Mohale said Carriage should go to Mamelodi’s region 6 offices to get in touch with a contractor if he wants to become a subcontractor.
