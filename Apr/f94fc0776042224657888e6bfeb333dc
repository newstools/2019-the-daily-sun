SHOUTING “Wozani”, they burned tyres in the streets. The residents would not allow the Red Ants into their kasi yesterday and kicked them out. Illegal squatters from Ironside in the Vaal have threatened bloodshed in the fight for their land. Midvaal Municipality got an order to remove the squatters. As the SunTeam spoke to community leaders, a man shouted: “We’re not going anywhere. If they want war, we’ll give them war.” Community leader Sayyid Kgaole said they would not back down and were prepared to die if the Red Ants demolished their homes. “We want our land. We are going nowhere. Midvaal Municipality didn’t follow the proper steps when they got their court order.” Kgaole said they went to the High Court to challenge the eviction order and the evictions were illegal. “The municipality knows we are challenging their eviction order in the High Court. We have an advocate representing us for free. “On 27 June, our matter will be heard in court but the municipality wants to evict us,” he said. Midvaal mayoral committee member for development Mokete Motsamai said the squatters had to evacuate the land as it was marked for development. “Two weeks ago, we got an eviction order and served it on time to residents. They’re refusing.” The evictions were postponed and meetings with the squatters were arranged to find a resolution. Motsamai said they would continue with their plan on Monday.
