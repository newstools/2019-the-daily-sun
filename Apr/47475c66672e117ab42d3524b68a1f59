SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is hoping for as strong finish to the season for his charges. They threatened to launch a late charge for the Absa Premiership title, however, their recent results have derailed it. They were stunned by AmaZulu midweek before sharing the spoils with Bidvest Wits on Saturday. Tembo, like his counterpart Bidvest Wits mentor Gavin Hunt, was not pleased with the officiating in their game at Mbombela Stadium which ended in a 1-1 stalemate. The match had it's fair share of controversy with Wits denied what looked like a legitimate winner late in the game. Matsatsantsa also felt hard done by skipper Dean Furman's red card, forcing them to play the final 25 minutes with ten men. “The game was a mess from an officiating point of view,” said Tembo. “But in terms of performance from the guys, I think we played well, we managed to neutralise their threat especially from crosses and tried to dominate the second ball. “We also dominated from set plays, we had better chances especially in the second half. “I’m very proud of the guys, I think they played very well, playing 25 minutes with ten men against a team like Wits is not easy.” Now, Tembo wants his charges to finish the season on a high note. They next travel to KwaZulu Natal to face Maitzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday, before concluding their season with a clash against Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium on 11 May. “The last two games are must-win games for us because we want to try and finish as high as we can.”
