THE DA wants action to be taken against teachers who send pregnant girls away from school. This comes after two pregnant grade 12 pupils from Ogwini High School in Umlazi, south of Durban, were told to leave until they had given birth. The pupils were expected to return to school yesterday after the DA intervened. However, KZN party leader Zwakele Mncwango said he still wanted KZN Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana to take action against teachers for violating the girls’ right to education. The principal allegedly told Nokuzola Shange from Folweni and Sinothile Zulu from Umlazi to leave school until next year. Mncwango said he received an SMS asking him to help the girls. Principal Vusimuzi Dlamini said the DA was politicising the matter and one of the pupils was eight months pregnant. “Pregnancy is like a chronic illness where one needs regular checkups by doctors, which schools don’t have,” said Dlamini. Education department spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said being pregnant at school was irresponsible and it wasn’t fair to expect teachers to act as midwives, as they weren’t trained.
