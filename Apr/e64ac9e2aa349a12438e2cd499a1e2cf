Star signs can often reveal a lot about a person, from their personality to their compatibility as a partner. And a study by Pharmica says star signs can also reveal a lot about people's bedroom habits too. PEOPLE born at the beginning of the year are more likely to be busy between the sheets than those born later in the year. A study by Pharmica has ranked the 12 star signs from the most frisky to the least, and it's bad news if you're a Scorpio. THE star signs getting the most - and the least - action have been revealed. AND it's good news if you're dating an Aries person. And if you're looking for a bit of romance in your life, you should probably date an Aries, as they 'get intimate' the most often. In second place were Pisces, followed by Gemini. People with birthdays in February, March, April, May and June got the most action. In contrast people celebrating birthdays in the latter part of the year appeared to lack physical intimacy. The star sign having the least sex was Gemini, with Libra's in second place, and Capricorn's performing the third worst. These zodiac signs have birthdays in September, October, November and December. It's time to check your date's star sign.  Source: The Sun
