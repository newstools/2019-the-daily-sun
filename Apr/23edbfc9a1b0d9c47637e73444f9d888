The community of Ironside in the Vaal sent the Red Ants packing on Wednesday. This after a failed attempt to evict illegal dwellers in Ironside. The defiant illegal dwellers stopped red ants from entering their kasi by burning tyres. They further said they will put their lives on the line and threatened to respond with violence if their shacks were demolished.
