FORTUNE Makaringe will join Orlando Pirates for the 2019-20 Absa Premiership, Maritzburg United coach Eric Tinkler has confirmed. Makaringe, who was one of the important pillars for the club’s success last season, has been heavily linked with the move to Pirates. It doesn’t need any rocket scientist to figure it out who recruited him to Pirates as former Maritzburg coach, Fadlu Davids, now assistant coach at Pirates, might have had an influence in sweetening the deal. In fact, it became more clearer last week that Makaringe is moving to Pirates when he dished out a five-star performance in their 1-0 loss to the Soweto giants. Said Tinkler: “Fortune wanted to prove a point to Pirates that hey, ‘I’m coming to you’. I must be honest, no player likes to lose, every player plays to win.” There was a glimmer of hope on Saturday when Maritzburg defeated Black Leopards 2-1 to give hope that they might ditch their dreaded relegation worries. Makaringe, who assisted in the first goal scored by Mohau Makate, is likely not to be the only one to join Pirates from Maritzburg. Ghanaian Goalkeeper, Richard Ofori, who has played all 28 league matches this season, is also set to depart to Irvin Khoza’s club. Also, Siphesihle Ndlovu maybe be also in the reckoning to sign for Pirates. The reigning Midfielder and Young Player of the Season is stalling on penning personal terms with Mamelodi Sundowns despite both parties agreeing in principle. Ndlovu, who grew up supporting Pirates, is said to be in favour of donning The Black and White jersey instead of the Brazilians’ kit.
