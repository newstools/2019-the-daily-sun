A
bus carrying mourners from a funeral overturned near KwaCeza, leaving 52 people
injured. “We
were extremely shocked to hear about the incident of the bus crash, just a
short while after we had just laid to rest our fellow compatriots who perished
at the Pentecostal Holiness Church last week,” KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr
Sibongiseni Dhlomo said. He praised
all the paramedics, doctors and nurses who sprung to action and rendered
medical assistance to the injured. “We
praise the Lord for sparing these lives this time. We are informed that 10
people sustained serious injuries from the bus accident, and 42 had minor
injuries. We wish them all a speedy and full recovery,” he added. Dhlomo
commend the KZN Health Emergency Medical Services for the medical attention. “We
dispatched seven Intermediate Life Support Paramedics, six Basic Life Support
paramedics, two Emergency Support Vehicles, and 1 rescue response vehicle to
the scene. “All
our EMS personnel applied themselves fully, stabilising those who were
seriously injured, before transferring them to hospital. They were equal to the
task, and we appreciate what they did,” said Dhlomo.
