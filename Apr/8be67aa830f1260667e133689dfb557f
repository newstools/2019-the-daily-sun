As the
Election Day draws closer, the electioneering is getting even more intense. Today the
Democratic Alliance took the fight to the Gauteng Premier David Makhura's
office in Newtown. Led by
their Gauteng Premier candidate Solly Msimanga and other DA leaders including
Chief Whip John Steenhuisen and MP Phumzile Van Damme. The DA
marched to the premier's office as part of their #StopCorruption march. The DA says
that over R20-billion has been lost in the last five years by the Gauteng
government under Makhura. The
marchers were joined by former DA leader Tony Leon at the Mary Fitzgerald
Square. Addressing
the crowds John Steenhuisen criticised journalist and thought leaders who are
saying who else but Cyril Ramaphosa. Steenhuisen
said that Ramaphosa is not a messiah. He said that Ramaphosa runs in the same
circle as people looting South Africa. Steenhuisen
also said that Andile Ramaphosa’s BOSASA money scandal is only but
"smallanyana" skeleton in Ramaphosa's closet. Addressing
supporters Solly Msimanga said that the ANC must ‘voetsek’. He said
that the ANC's time in Gauteng government is up. He said that when they get
into power they will set up a commission of inquiry to look into the corruption
in Gauteng.
