GOGO Joyce Aphane has stood guard next to a trench near her home for a month. Joyce (70) said the ditch was an accident waiting to happen. After waiting for the municipality to fix a pipe and close the trench which its workers dug, she reported it. But the trench is still full of muddy water and hasn’t been closed. She sometimes wakes up in a panic to go and check whether kids are playing near it. “If this isn’t fixed, my heart will stop,”she said. Resident Melvin Sambo (27) said it was heartbreaking to see Joyce guarding the kids. “She’s always there, as if she’s being paid. This needs to be fixed so she can enjoy her old age peacefully.” Spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the municipality would respond once it knew where the trench is.
