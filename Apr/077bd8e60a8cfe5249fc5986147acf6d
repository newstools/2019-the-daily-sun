BABES Wodumo, her sister Nondumiso Simelane and Tipcee were disciplined by magistrate Jackie Jonk in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday. The three are facing a case of assault. Only Tipcee, whose real name is Thobeka Ndaba, arrived on time. When she moved around in the dock, Jonk said: “Stand still and drop the attitude!” Their lawyer Thobani Khuzwayo withdrew from representing them, claiming they were not co-operating with him. Their new lawyer Sandile Shoba told the court Babes and Nondumiso had a problem with their car. “Again?” asked Jonk. She said she would issue a warrant of arrest if the sisters didn’t arrive in court in 10 minutes. Babes and Nondumiso showed up with smiles on their faces. The court resumed after 10 minutes. Jonk then asked Nondumiso what had happened to their car, and she replied while shaking her head: “Eish, the usual.” Then Jonk said: “The usual? I suggest you take Uber or Taxify in future.” Nondumiso said: “That’s what we did.” Jonk told them she was tired of their excuses and gave them a final warning. When Tipcee moved in the dock, the magistrate said: “Stop moving! Mr Shoba, is accused number one under the influence or something?” Shoba replied: “No, my Lord. She’s sober. She’s very sober.” The case was postponed to 16 May for pre-trial. The three were bust last month after Nelisiwe Zondi opened a case.
