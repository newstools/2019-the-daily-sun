GAUTENG Premier David Makhura will take part in a memorial walk and deliver a lecture in honour of the late Eudy Simelane. The walk will take place on Friday in Kwa-Thema, Ekurhuleni. Makhura visited Eudy’s home on Thursday following the death of Eudy’s mother, Mally, early last week after a short illness. Mally was known for promoting the rights of the LGBTI community and attended many events to raise the flag against the brutal killing of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. This was after the brutal killing of her daughter in 2008. Eudy, who lived openly as a lesbian, was raped and killed. Her body was found in the bush not far from home. At the time, Eudy was a Banyana Banyana player. Makhura said the family had suffered another tragedy. “Mom Mally was the anchor of this family,” he said. The premier said communities needed to accept the LGBTI community. “We want Gauteng to be the home of the LGBTI community. Not in our name, should there be gay bashing. “The killing should stop and perpetrators should be put behind bars,” Makhura said. “We must educate families and retrain civil servants to create an environment that is truly free.” Eudy’s brother, Bafana, said their mum never stopped visiting the place where Eudy took her last breath. He said she would sit there quietly before walking back home.
