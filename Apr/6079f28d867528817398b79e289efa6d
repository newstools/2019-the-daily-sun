PERCY Tau could be set for a rich reward following his breakthrough season in Europe. The Bafana Bafana star has been nominated for the Proximus League Player of the Year award in the Belgian second division. Tau has been a revelation for Royal Union Saint-Gilloise where he is on loan from English Premiership side Brighton & Hove Albion. The 24-year-old has been consistent throughout the season, scoring six goals and contributing seven assists, including in the 3-2 loss to Wassland Beveren in the Jupiler Pro League playoff clash on Saturday. He will be vying for the gong with among others, his Saint Gilloise teammate Faiz Selemani. “Selemani Faiz and Percy Tau are nominated in the Proximus League Player of the year category at the Pro footballer’s Gala,” the club said. The winner will be announced at the awards ceremony on 6 May.
