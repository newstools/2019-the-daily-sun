HE FOUND the woman and her children sleeping. The 30-year-old man then tried to rape her, but she fought him off. But he grabbed the two-year-old boy and ran away with him. The suspect was arrested, but the boy has been missing since. During the search on Saturday in Delportshoop, Northern Cape, clothes believed to belong to the boy were found in the veld. It’s been four days and the suspect will not say where the child is. The missing child’s father (34) said he was at work when the incident happened. “This is so painful. The boy’s twin brother is always crying and looking for him. I am afraid this cruel man has killed my child,” said the dad. Resident Isaac Botsane (48) said they were working with the parents and police to find the boy. “We haven’t slept since this happened. People are so cruel. We don’t want him in our community. We will kill him if he is released,” said Isaac. Police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana said the boy hasn’t been found. “During the search, clothes believed to belong to the boy were found in the veld. “A man in his 30s was arrested and charged with attempted rape. “He will appear in the Barkly West Magistrates Court soon,” said Tawana.
