THERE seems to be proof on social media that Mzansi’s Shiraaz Mohamed is still alive. A video shows the kidnapped photojournalist kneeling next to a man holding an assault rifle. He’s begging for help from President Cyril Ramaphosa and the international community. It seems as if the video was taken two weeks ago, because the paper in his hands is dated 13 April. “I need your help in securing my freedom. I live in fear of my life, and I’m scared,” he pleads. Shiraaz was kidnapped on 10 January 2017 near Gift of the Givers’ Ar Rahma Hospital in Syria. The organisation’s Imtiaz Sooliman said Shiraaz wanted to tell the tragedy of Syria’s people in pictures. He said they first received proof of him being alive on 8 January last year in the form of answers to 10 personal questions. Shiraaz’s family was sure it was from him. “The proof of life video arrived by WhatsApp on 26 April. They were full of hope and grateful to the Almighty.”
