MEMBERS of the DA yesterday visited the same Cape Town station where President Cyril Ramaphosa launched a new train a few weeks ago. “The problem is the train that was launched two weeks ago was an election campaign. This is the safest train in South Africa, but people cannot use it because it is on bricks instead of rail,” said Western Cape premier candidate Alan Winde. Winde said the only solution was to give municipalities the power to manage trains. Natasha Mazone, DA spokeswoman on public enterprises, said state owned transport entities Prasa and Transnet had failed. “This is the situation because they have been an employment agency for the ANC and a cash cow for the ANC for many years.” Thobela Xoseni was not asked to plead. The case was postponed to 2 May to allow the suspect to be psychologically evaluated. The civil society coalition Unitebehind condemned train arson and criticised Transport Minister Blade Nzimande for failing to ensure train safety.
