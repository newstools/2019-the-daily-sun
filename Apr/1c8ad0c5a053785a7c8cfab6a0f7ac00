AMAZULU have all but secured their top flight status for another season. This after Usuthu dispatched SuperSport United 2-0 in their Absa Premiership encounter at the King Zwelithini Stadium last night. Bongi Ntuli and Somila Ntsundwana scored the goals that saw the KwaZulu-Natal team reach the magical 30 point mark, which often guarantees safety. Usuthu will be pleased to be out of danger, having been the hot favourites to go down earlier in the season. They did well to claw their way out of danger and now look set for another season in the big time. Matsatsantsa a Pitori on the other hand, are now out of the fierce title race following the defeat. They remain in fourth place on the standings, with 43 points from 27 matches. Kaitano Tembo’s charges can’t catch leaders Orlando Pirates now and will have to settle for a top four finish at best. They came into the match oozing with confidence following their 2-0 win over Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns last week. However, they could not continue their fine form as of late, with their five match unbeaten coming to an end. Usuthu started the match on the front foot, pegging Matsatsantsa back in the early stages. They punished the Tshwane-based team in the 54th minute when Ntuli fired in the all-important goal after he was played through by Ovidy Karuru. Substitute Ntsundwana put the final nail in the coffin at the death, his goal sealing the points for AmaZulu. The loss brought to an end Rise and Shine’s eight game unbeaten run. They remain in sixth place on the standings while Siwelele are now just a point adrift of the top eight.
