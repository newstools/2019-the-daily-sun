AN Emirati woman opened her eyes and regained consciousness after spending 27 years in a coma induced by a serious brain injury, her family said. Munira Omar was 32 when she was injured in a road traffic accident in 1991 after picking up her son Omar (4) from school in the city of Al-Ain. Omar survived and lived to see his mum awake again decades later in a hospital bed in Germany, where she had been transferred for medical care. “I always believed my mother would get better,” Omar, now 32, said on Wednesday. “Many doctors had told us not to expect much after being in a coma for 15 or 20 years, but I would not accept that. “This is all in God’s hands, and I never lost hope.” Omar said he travelled to Germany to be with her during her stay there, and rarely left her side. She woke up in May last year, but her family chose to keep the news under wraps out of respect for her privacy. Now 60, Munira is in a stable condition and at home in the UAE, after being enrolled in a physical rehabilitation programme, with her family nearby, Omar said. “We wanted to make sure that she was in a stable condition before we went public to share our experience. “We felt we needed to share the story to give people going through the same or similar experiences hope,” he said. – REUTERS
