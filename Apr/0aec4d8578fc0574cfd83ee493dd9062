LOCAL and foreign shop owners in Tweefontein section G, near Kwamhlanga, are living in fear after their shops were looted. About 11 shops were attacked on Tuesday afternoon by a group of people pretending to be protesting about the provision of water. Shop assistant Lindiwe Masango (36) said she had to hide at the back of the shop while the “protesters” emptied it. She said children were put in the front of the crowd when the toyi-toying and looting started. “People started by coming in and out of the shop. I suspected that there was something sinister about it. I decided to close the shop and sell through the burglar door. Then I heard a window breaking as they were throwing stones. “I hid in another room. They broke the door and took everything inside. They even broke the fridges. They took money and my cellphone that I’d left on a charger,” she said. Shop owner Azad Mohammed (29) said their businesses were under siege. “These people use service delivery as a reason to commit crime. If there is no water, we all suffer, and it has nothing to do with our businesses. When people come to ask for food, we give it to them for free and say they can pay later. They turn against us when we are the ones helping them.”
