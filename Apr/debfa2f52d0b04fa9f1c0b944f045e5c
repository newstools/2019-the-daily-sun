Inconsistency has been Kaizer Chiefs’ Achilles heel this season. Amakhosi have blown hot and cold for most of the season in the Absa Premiership. As a result, they languish in seventh spot on the standings with 38 points from 27 matches. Their 1-1 draw against Golden Arrows on Tuesday, was their 11th of the season. They could not quite replicate their stunning performance in the Nedbank Cup semi-final against Chippa United, however, their coach Ernst Middendorp believes they still played well. Amakhosi were unlucky not to have scored more than one goal, having created numerous chances and even struck the woodwork no less than three times. “We played well, but if it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be,” the German tactician told his club’s website. “Reeve Frosler had his first 90 minutes in about a year. It was also good to see Joseph Molangoane getting minutes after having been injured for about eight months. “We are trying to bring him back. He has experience and will help us." Middendorp also explained that star player Khama Billiat’s exclusion in the match day squad, had nothing to do with the car accident he suffered a few days ago. Chiefs now turn their attention to Bloemfontein Celtic at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (8.15)
