THE preference of using international artists and actors to portray some of our late heroes in Mzansi films and events has been a contentious issue for years. This has always angered local stars, who often feel overlooked in favour of American stars. The latest star, who is still seething over this issue, is actor, musician and fitness fanatic Clint Brink, who took to his Twitter account to tell his followers how he feels about this trend. “What is it with SA and it's love for America?? We get USA peeps to portray our heroes in films. We would pay bucket loads for American artists to perform on our shores but tell local artists to perform for peanuts. We even had freaking Brandy Norwood at the Sport Awards..Why?,” he wrote. Some Hollywood A-listers, who played local heroes, include singer and actress Jennifer Hudson, who in 2011 played Winnie Mandela in the film Winnie Mandela: a life – much to the ire of South Africans. Internationally renowned actor Idris Alba played Nelson Mandela in Long walk to freedom.
