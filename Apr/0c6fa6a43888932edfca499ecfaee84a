MSHOZA feels like she is not getting enough credit in South Africa and she is ready to take her talents to the States! As she aims for a Grammy. The renowned 'Queen of Kaito' feels like she has not received the recognition she deserves in SA. She shared the bold statement on social media,“This year I am celebrating my 20 years in the industry and it's our 25 years of democracy. Yet no local accolade in my name. Let me rather aim for that Grammy Award. After all, I am Africa's Queen of Kwaito” She wrote. We must admit two decades is a long time in the industry! And hopefully, the Kortes hitmaker will finally get the recognition and accolades she deserves. This year I am celebrating my 20 years in the industry and it's our 25 years of democracy. Yet no local accolate in my name. Let me rather aim for that Grammy Award. After all I am Africa's Queen of Kwaito. #notngoSonto #sama25 @recordingacademy A post shared by  Mshoza_thegodmother1 (@mshoza_thegodmother1) on Apr 25, 2019 at 12:02am PDT
