HE claims to have miraculously healed six bedridden patients. Pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia international ministries posted pictures on Facebook and said that "this morning (Sunday 28 April) families delivered seriously ill relatives to AMI seeking the healing power of God. Said Lukau: "Jehovah Rapha LIFTED them up from the grave. Men and women who have not been able to operate as normal STOOD UP and began to RUN as soon as the power of God touched them. What a Mighty God we serve! I am praying for you, may the hand of God reach you and lift you wherever you are." The pastor and his church made headlines in February after a video showing a man being 'raised from the dead' went viral on Monday. Social media is angry after this second miracle. They say he is fake and is playing with peopleâ€™s faiths.
