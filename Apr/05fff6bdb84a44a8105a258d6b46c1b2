KAIZER Chiefs mentor Ernst Middendorp was left frustrated by his side’s slow start to their Absa Premiership clash against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. Amakhosi’s disappointing season continued after they were downed by a spirited Siwelele outfit who moved into the top eight with win. The Glamour Boys, whose performance left a lot to be desired, remain rooted to seventh on the standings with 38 points from 28 matches. They only have the top eight to play for in the league having long blown any chance of lifting the title. They never got out of first gear against Siwelele and were duly handed their eighth loss of the season. Middendorp was left to rue his charges’ slow start to the match, which has been a familiar occurrence this season for Amakhosi. “It’s always the same, against Golden Arrows, Baroka before that and now against Celtic. We start slow, we start arrogant, and we don’t start games with the right dynamic or intention,” Middendorp told SuperSport TV after the game. “We highlighted it again and again and then of course we go 1-0 down. The opponents go into their shell and close the door and we don’t find the key. “Its not the first time, we have to ask ourselves what we are doing in the beginning.” The Soweto giants are left with just two matches to try and improve their position on the log. They play Free State Stars at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3.pm) before concluding their campaign against a desperate Chippa United outfit at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on the final day. “We need points, we need to do better, it’s very clear,” concluded the German tactician.
