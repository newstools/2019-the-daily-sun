STREET traders who trade next to the market and old Jubilee Hall on the N2 towards Norwood in Mthatha are living in fear. They told Daily Sun that armed thugs rob people in broad daylight. One of the traders said thugs threaten them if they scream or call for help. She said the robbers hide in old, unused municipal buildings such as the hall after they rob people. “Our lives are in danger. We don’t know if we’ll get robbed when we knock off late,” said the trader. According to another trader, the robbers mostly target pupils and foreigners. “They come in groups and follow their victims. Two of them keep watch. “I once saw them robbing an elderly man and taking his phone and money. They choked him until he nearly passed out.” The traders said they have on several occasions called the municipality and cops for help, but they never came. They said they did not want to take the law into their own hands. African Hawkers Association chairwoman Thembeka Gawulekhaya said: “We know the people who are doing this, and we’re ready to work with the police. We can’t fight this alone.” Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said: “We’re doing raids there and we’ll continue to do so.” King Sabata Dalindyebo municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said: “The municipality is going to send security officers to ensure people running their businesses are safe at all times.” Mampoza said the council had not decided whether or not the structures will be demolished.
