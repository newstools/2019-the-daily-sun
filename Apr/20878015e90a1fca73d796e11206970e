ENTER early! This is the plea from Soweto Marathon director Danny Blumberg to athletes, who will be entering the 26th edition of the annual race taking place on 3 November. Entries open ton Wednesday (1 May) and close on 31 July. As many as 40 000 runners are expected to pound the streets of the historic township, the number of entrants having been increased from 30 000. “Please enter early and start preparing now,” Blumberg said at the race launch in Soweto on Tuesday. “Having as many as 40 000 athletes we need to make sure everything is well organised, from the safety aspect right through to the race day, looking out for potential risk elements. “Safety comes first in any event of this magnitude there are many elements you have to be concerned about. We will be happy to make this a good experience for everyone.” Soweto Marathon Trust chairman Sello Khunou race boss has encouraged runners to prepare well so that they finish the race.“ Summon the triumphant spirit, lace up and conquer,” said Khunou. “We are hoping the winner is from Soweto this year. We get disappointed when the prize money goes elsewhere.”The event offers three distances, the 42km, 21km and 10km.
