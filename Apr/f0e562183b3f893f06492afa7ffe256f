THE floods in KwaZulu Natal have claimed the lives of at least 21 people. It’s reported that over 2000 emergency calls were logged last night in and around the affected area. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) said the rain has caused massive damage. “The Provincial Government of KZN, together with Ethekwini Metro and all affected municipalities, are currently mounting a spirited response as part of efforts to alleviate the impact,” the department said in a statement. According to the department they have now sourced additional capacity from uMsunduzi Municipality and iLembe District. Most deaths are reportedly from Chatsworth, uMlazi, New Germany where two kids under the age of seven years got killed. The department added that they will be moving to the ground to conduct assessments.  “Some rivers have broken their banks and we urge people to be extra cautious. We are also issuing warnings for the Northern parts of KZN including King Cetshwayo District Municipality. The extent of damage to infrastructure includes flooded and blocked roads, collapsed buildings and perimeter walls, blocked storm water drains and sewer lines, flooded buildings and households and power outages as a result of electric cable damage.” The department says displaced communities will be temporarily accommodated in community halls where they will receive emergency relief assistance.
