FRIENDS of the editor of an Mpumalanga community newspaper, Ezweni, want to see justice done. His body was found in his car last Wednesday after Vosman police in Witbank received a report of a black Polo parked on the N4 near Balmoral. Welcome Thobejane (43) was allegedly strangled and beaten to death. He was on his way to Witbank from a church service in Pretoria. His friend, Lucas Tjatji (36) said Thobejane spent most of his time in church. Lucas said the last time he spoke to Welcome, he told him about the business plans he had for the church. “We are still in denial about what has happened. His death is still a shock to me. “He was passionate about community development. This is a great loss for everyone. I never dreamed he would leave us this soon. “He was a very good person who didn’t deserve to die like this,” Lucas said. “The only way we will find closure is when his killers pay for what they did. We want to see his killers behind bars,” he said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said investigations are still continuing and no arrests have been made yet. Anyone with information that could assist the police with investigations should contact the nearest police station.
