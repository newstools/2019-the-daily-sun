THE Gumedes say the people who burned the young brothers to death hated their family. Andile Gumede (12) and his brother Ayanda (4) were found dead by family members in their room in Jozini on Sunday with burn wounds. Their uncle, Nkosinathi Gumede (50), told Daily Sun yesterday the family thought that someone who hated the family wanted to destroy everyone in the house but only found the kids. “But we don’t have any enemies,” Nkosinathi said. He said the family attended the Easter weekend sermon and the kids were left with their father but he couldn’t hear anything because he is deaf and dumb. Nkosinathi said he received a call from neighbours while he was at church, telling him to come home. He told other family members and they rushed home, where they found the brothers lying dead. Nkosinathi said they found petrol cans next to the bodies. “The only conclusion we can come to is the killers hated our family and wanted to destroy all of us. “We don’t believe the kids were the target but they were killed. “It’s unbelievable that people can be so evil and cruel and kill kids in this brutal manner.” Nkosinathi said his brother met Ayanda’s mum in Mbombela in Mpumalanga, and she is in Nkandla. He said the family decided the kids should live with their father in Jozini. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Jozini police are investigating two cases of murder. No one has been arrested yet.
