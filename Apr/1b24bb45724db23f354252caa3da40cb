A VIDEO of a drunken man, apparently taken at Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth on Saturday, has surfaced. Shocked patients watch as the drunk hospital worker staggers around behind a counter, a beer bottle in hand. It looks as if the video was taken by people who were visiting the hospital. “Is there anyone who can help us?” one man is heard asking. The drunken man is seen staring through the bars on the counter at the people taking videos. “Will you help us open a file, please?” asks a frustrated woman. The official responds by asking her who the file was for. “I’m not a doctor,” he says. Later he’s seen trying to help a patient, but he’s simply too drunk. The hospital told Daily Sun it knew about the video but refused to give further details. Eastern Cape Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha told Daily Sun such behaviour was unacceptable at public hospitals. “This can be viewed as serious misconduct,” he said. “To ensure that this deed does not go unpunished, we have since sent this matter to the Department of Labour for further investigation.” People expressed anger when the video started making rounds on social media platforms. Brenda White said: “Getting drunk on any job is unacceptable, at a hospital even worse.” Brian Witbooi said: “I can’t believe this. These are grounds for instant dismissal. Surely, management should take immediate action.”
