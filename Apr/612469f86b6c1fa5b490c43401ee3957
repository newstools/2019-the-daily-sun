EVERYTHING is expected to go back to normal at Ekuvukeni, near Ladysmith, in the KZN Midlands today after the visit of President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday. The residents promised to stop all protests in the area after the president promised to fix all their problems. The residents started the disorder in early January. They were complaining about water and sanitation services and vowed to continue the unrest until Ramaphosa came to address them. This resulted in the area being brought to a standstill and the closure of six local schools. During his visit, Ramaphosa promised that all government officials who failed to provide basic services to residents would be sent packing and fired. “We are aware that you have been protesting for a long time, demanding water services and sanitation. “I will investigate what happened to the money set aside for water and sanitation projects and if any official is found to have taken that money, I will act against them,” said Ramaphosa. He urged residents to open the roads again so that children can go back to school. One of the residents leading the march, Sphesihle Ndlovu (24), said they are happy Ramaphosa listened to them. “What makes us really happy is that he promised to get rid of all corrupt leaders. We believe that there was money for the water and sanitation projects. “We have decided to suspend the protest and we will open all the roads as we believe that Ramaphosa will help us get out of our misery,” said Sphesihle. A teacher from one of the schools said they are happy they will be able to go back to school, although there’s a lot of work to catch up. The schools have been closed for almost two months.
