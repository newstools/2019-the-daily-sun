ALL they wanted was running water. But residents in Moemaneng, Marquard, Free State said people are paying with their lives. Residents took to the streets to demand service delivery, but three people died when cops were trying to calm the protest. Now furious residents blame the municipality for the death of two teenage boys and a man. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said three men drowned in the protest. “Two were running away as the police were dispersing the crowd. They ran towards a river, where they drowned. A third man attempted to rescue them and drowned as well,” said Mbambo. Mantja Kola (41) lost her husband Lephesang Khampempe (31) when he tried to save the two boys. Community leader Teboho Motsitsi said, “Setsoto Municipality has failed residents. It started in Ficksburg, now it’s us. “People are dying just for water. We started protesting a month ago. We requested our mayor to address us but he didn’t show up.” Setsoto municipal spokesman Letlama Mboweni said the community had protested for water, but the protest was over. “We started giving the community water last week and not all areas were without water.
