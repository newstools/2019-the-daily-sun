IF the curtains were to come down on the current Absa Premiership season today, Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama would be relatively happy with their finish. Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba are in eighth spot on the standings with 34 points from 26 matches. They have four games remaining to seal their top eight finish and end what would be considered a successful season for them. Da Gama is aware that things can still change at this late stage of the season and has urged his players to keep the same level of energy and desire. “We’ve done well to be where we are, especially as a promoted team,” said Da Gama. “But we can’t take our foot off the pedal at this crucial stage of the season. We need to make that final push and end our season on a high. “We need to be consistent and build that winning culture.” Da Gama’s charges are currently on a four game unbeaten run having last tasted defeat against Kaizer Chiefs last month. They will be looking to stretch that run when they lock horns with Cape Town City at the Cape Town Stadium this evening (7.30pm). The Citizens have fallen down the standings in recent weeks and will be hoping to reignite their title charge. They head into the clash on the back of an unexpected lengthy break after their match against Bloemfontein Celtic was abandoned in the 22nd minute a week ago when angry Siwelele supporters stormed the field of play. Da Gama is hoping this will work in his side’s favour as he expects the Citizens to find it difficult to regain their rhythm. Added Da Gama: “Playing after a long break can sometimes work against you. “Obviously, you could be fresher and run your opponents ragged. “But you could also have a bit of rustiness, which I’m hoping will be the case for them.”
