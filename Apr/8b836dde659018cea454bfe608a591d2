HE DIDN’T want to sit at home and do nothing after he retired. So madala Ramoremi Mosuwe (68) from unit 17 in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane spends his time cleaning his kasi. The retired cop collects bottles and boxes. “I wanted to make a difference in my community so I started recycling,” he said. Madala Ramoremi walks from Ga-Rankuwa to Mabopane and uses a wheelbarrow to collect bottles. “I wake up at 4am and clean local taverns. From there I clean the streets,” he said. On weekends, he wakes up at 3am. “People drink a lot on weekends and throw bottles on the road and pavements. I have to make sure the road is clean in the morning.” He said this was also part of his exercise. Mmabatho Mosibi (38) said the madala always helped them whenever they had functions. “When we have weddings or funerals in our kasi, we go to bed tired. But when we wake up, we find a clean yard. He is our hero,” she said.
