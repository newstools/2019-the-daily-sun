IN all honesty, Robert du Preez has just lived to fight another day. The embattled Sharks coach needed a little breathing space more than any other local coach in the Super Rugby tourney, and truly earned it as he guided the Durbanites to their 23-15 victory over the Waratahs in Sydney on Saturday. For Du Preez the battle appear to be very much about asserting his credentials as a right man to lead the under-performing Durban franchise in the long term… three seasons on into the position. In an open letter, Sharks legend Tony Watson slammed Du Preez, saying the team has been in free fall for almost two seasons, “with no clearly defined pattern of play”. The letter seemed to have coaxed better performance out out of the Sharks as they got their Australasia tour off to an ideal start.Yet the heat will be back on when they travel to Christchurch to face the all-conquering Crusaders. Following back-to-back losses against the Jaguares and Reds at home in Durban, du Preez freshened up his team with several rotational changes. The changes included Curwin Bosch, who didn’t disappoint in his first start at fly-half this year. The Springbok contributed 13 points, slotting over three penalty goals and two conversions, as the Sharks ended a win-less run of eight games against the Waratahs in Sydney, stretching as far as back 2000. Elsewhere, the Stormers bounced back from their poor tour Down Under to edge the Bulls 24-23 in their North-South derby at Newlands on Saturday. The Lions were reminded of last year’s Super Rugby finals when they lost 36-10 to the Crusaders in Christchurch. The Joburg side will have a bye next weekend as they return home after a three-weeks tour.Injury-prone captain Warren Whiteley had to be withdrawn from the starting team after he failed a late fitness test on the eve of the match while hooker Malcolm Marx was also rested for this encounter as per the national team protocol.
