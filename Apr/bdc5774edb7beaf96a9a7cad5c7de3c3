ELDERS from Baphalane Ba Mantserre Trust in North West picketed outside the North Gauteng High Court on Tuesday. Lucky Moabi said they were forcibly removed from Schilpadsnest in 1963 and sent to Mantserre because Anglo American wanted to mine there. “After the land claims process, we needed a trust board the custodian of beneficiaries’ assets.” Lucky said the community didn’t benefit because the board was corrupt. Board members were elected last year, but most residents didn’t want them. “Our trust chairman wrote a letter asking for the elections to be postponed until the matter was cleared. “But they continued and certain residents were served with restraining orders the night before. “The office of the master of the court was contacted and it decided not to issue authority for the newly elected trustees, unless served with a court order.” Lucky said of the board chairman: “We suspect he has a separate agreement where he might be getting money from Anglo. “Anglo Platinum is paying royalties to the board, and we feel R2 million a year is too little for a mine of its size. “ A mine called Cronimet, next to Anglo, paid R26 million in 2008. The money disappeared. “About R10 million of the R26 million was said to have been donated elsewhere.” Lucky said beneficiaries registered an association and took the trust to court. “Judgment called for the trust to be disbanded and a new one to be formed. “The founder in the meantime forced the office of the master of the high court to give authority to his corruptly elected, new trust members. Beneficiaries were against it, but he continued.”
