THE Mchunu family believe their eight-year-old boy, who went missing in January, was kidnapped for muthi. His aunt Fikelephi Mchunu (22) said they believe Nkosingiphile was kidnapped for his body parts from his home in Nquthu, northern KZN, by people sent by an inyanga. Fikelephi said residents caught and assaulted the man they suspected had kidnapped him. He died before he could say what had happened to the boy. She said the man had apparently told residents he killed the boy. “We found lots of bottles in his bag filled with something that looked like muthi, a sharp knife and a letter instructing him that he needed to get a boy’s heart in order for him to be rich.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a missing person’s docket was being investigated by Dundee police. He confirmed that a man suspected of kidnapping a child was killed, allegedly by residents. He said Nquthu police were investigating a murder case.
