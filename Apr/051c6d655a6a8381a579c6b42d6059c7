President Cyril Ramaphosa bestowed the 2019 National
Orders Awards on distinguished local citizens. Also on eminent foreign nationals who
have played a momentous role towards building a free and peaceful democratic
South Africa and for improving the lives of South Africans in various
ways. The occasion took place the Grand Patron of the National
Orders on Thursday. Said Ramaphosa: “We have among us here today South
Africans who have excelled in a number of fields and who have made an
invaluable contribution to enriching public life: whether it is in the
academic, social, cultural, technological, music, artistic, political and other
spheres. “We are also joined by the families of those who have
unfortunately passed away, to receive on their behalf the recognition they so
richly deserve. “We have among us today the very best of such citizens.” Ramaphosa told those being bestowed that they have gained
recognition for their dedication to personal, professional and other
improvement; to putting themselves at the service of the country; and for their
willingness to do their part to make South Africa a better place. “In doing so you have displayed not self-interest, but
selflessness and altruism, the noble values that defined our struggle for
liberation.” The National Orders are the highest awards that South
Africa bestows, through the President of the Republic, upon citizens and
members of the international community who have contributed meaningfully
towards making the country a free democratic and successful nation, united in
its diversity. During the ceremony, President Ramaphosa bestowed the
Order of Ikhamanga, the Order of the Baobab, the Order of Luthuli, and the
Order of the Companions of OR Tambo to the deserving recipients. Among those who were bestowed are: Yvonne Chaka Chaka Mhinga, 9-year-old Thapelo Tambani and Mary Mhlongo.
