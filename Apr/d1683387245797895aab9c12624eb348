Read the sweet post below: Those closest to me know the story behind this and what it meant for me to do this for my daughter without involving the bank despite the hurdles along the way. My dream has always been to give you a decent start after your matric year. This came sooner than I expected and I’m grateful to God for opening so many doors for me last year. My biggest achievement last year was to be debt free. It took discipline, commitment and resisting temptation. It took starving the destruction and outside noise to listen to my own voice and feed the focus. Congratulations Aurèlie, as you are 2 months away from 18 years... You are are a property owner and a car owner and it’s debt free!! This is a mother’s dream realized. A mother that refuses to be defined by seasons of darkness, but paradoxically it is the very darkness that inspires light to come in! #LastYearJune #SilenceIsGolden A post shared by  Nonhle Jali ????
