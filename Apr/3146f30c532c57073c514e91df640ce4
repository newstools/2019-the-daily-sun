BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt is expecting goalkeeper Darren Keet to leave the club at the end of the season after failing to agree on terms with the player. The 29-year-old's contract is set to come to an end in June and Hunt is already planning for life without the Bafana Bafana shot stopper. "The situation with Darren is he hasn't signed a new contract and his people and our people have not come to an agreement," Hunt told the reporters after their 3-1 victory over Black Leopards at Bidvest Stadium on Wednesday night. "We have to do what I'm told to do, which is best for the club in long term. He has been our number one and if he doesn't want to stay then I must play Goss." Meanwhile, following their victory over Leopards, Hunt believes the title race is still on. It is not done and dusted yet, anything can still happen. He said:"We are still fighting and mathematically anything can still happen. We are disappointed because we got ourselves here and we should be in a better situation."
