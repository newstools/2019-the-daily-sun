Police have reportedly withdrawn theft charges against former Tshwane Mayor's brother. Solly Msimanga's bother, Nkululeko Msimanga, had the theft charges against him withdrawn after he was allegedly caught on camera stealing 100 computer boxes from the offices of the City of Tshwane. He was arrested about two weeks ago after the City of Tshwane pressed criminal charges against him. Gauteng police’s Captain Augustinah Selepe told News24 that there were not enough prospects to rule on the case. She also said that no witnesses came forward or was willing to give a statement. Selepe was quoted as saying that the case had to be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority to decide whether they would prosecute or not. Based on a lack of evidence, the case was withdrawn.
