MMANOKO MOKAA (24) is one student who’s managed to put a smile on her parents’ faces. In 2013 she managed to get seven distinctions. A few years later Mmanoko made her parents proud: she graduated with a degree in chemical engineering at Wits University. The SunTeam had a second opportunity to meet and interview this bright, hard-working young girl from Lebotlwane. “University is more challenging than high school,” she said. “One has to be mentally prepared for the first year, avoid making unnecessary friendships, and put more effort in their school work. “Those who drop out or fail during their first year face challenges such as money, making new friends and being away from home. “Second year and third yearn are the same regarding friendships and course challenges. “But again, third year is integration of work done during first year and second year.” Mmanoko’s dad Solomon told Daily Sun: “I’m proud of what she has achieved, and I believe she’ll continue to be a good role model to her peers. “She’s always been humble and hardworking throughout primary and high school. “Going to Wits had its own challenges. She was also given a task to be in charge of student residences. “Yet she managed to pass her degree in record time. The seven students she started the course with had to supplement some courses.” Her uncle and mentor Mike Chauke, who’s a ward 11 counsellor at Mogogelo Village, said: “She’s a disciplined someone who made us proud as a province. “We hope she’ll continue to contribute to our province and country.”
