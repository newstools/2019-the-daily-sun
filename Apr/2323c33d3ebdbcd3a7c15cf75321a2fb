MAMELODI Sundowns have been ordered to pay a fine of R250 000 and will not lose any POINTS for fielding an ineligible player. Sundowns had been found guilty of fielding Wayne Arendse while ineligible to play in their Absa Premiership fixture against Bidvest Wits on 7 October. According the PSL DC ruling, half of the fine is suspended for a period of 12 months, provided they are not found guilty of a similar offence during the period of suspension. Arendse, the second respondent in the matter, has been ordered to pay a fine of R50 000, which is wholly suspended for a period of 12 months, provided that he is not found guilty of a similar offence during the period of suspension. In their submission to the DC, the League, who were the complainant in the matter, had called for a harsher punishment, citing the contentious Tendai Ndoro case, and that Sundowns showed no remorse by pleading not guilty to the charge when they first appeared before the DC.
