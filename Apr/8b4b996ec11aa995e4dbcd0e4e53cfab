DA leader Mmusi Maimane met IEC officials about his complaint implicating the ANC in violent protests in Alexandra, Joburg. Addressed the media after his meeting outside the IEC office in Tshwane yesterday, he said he was confident his complaint would be attended to. “The ANC is feeling the pressure. “They see that even their support is declining, therefore they have to intimidate people.” He said he wanted answers before the election. Maimane said people had the right to protest but it was something else when they shut down the city. He said they planned to take the matters between the DA, IEC and former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille to court. He insisted De Lille was fired. “She jumped before she was pushed,” he said. Regarding EFF leader Julius Malema’s remarks about the DA being hostile to them, he said he was not going to turn a blind eye to corruption. “My vision for South Africa is that we reduce the ANC to less than 50% so that we can reform,” he said.
