SINDY Jili has had enough of voting and political parties. The 36-year-old mum of three from Amatikwe in Inanda, north of Durban, told Daily Sun she had been living in a one-roomed mud house for several years but no one would help her. She said in 2017 politicians from various parties took turns visiting her to lie to her face. “After the walls of my house collapsed during a storm, politicians came to take photos of me and took down my details. They all promised to help but it was the last time I saw them.” Sindy said the politicians sounded sincere. She believed they would keep their promises but she is still waiting. “After seeing they were not going to come back, I decided to fix my house by myself at the beginning of last year,” she said. Sindy said she was not able to do a very good job. Some parts of the roof and walls leak whenever it rains. “I feel no one really deserves my vote,” she said. eThekwini municipal spokeswoman Msawakhe Mayisela said: “The house has been inspected and will be rebuilt soon.”
