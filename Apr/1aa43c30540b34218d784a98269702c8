A
woman who went missing was found severely beaten at a lodge in Frank Street in
Newton Park in Port Elizabeth. The
owner of the lodge reportedly contacted cops after finding her lying on the bed
with serious injuries. It
is alleged that she and her friend booked into the lodge on 4 April. On
29 April 2019, the owner informed the victim’s friend that they must vacate the
lodge and when they went into the room, they found a confused and beaten up
woman on the bed. “The
60-year-old male was arrested and detained on a charge of assault with intent
to do grievous bodily harm. The woman was hospitalised,” cops spokesperson Colonel
Priscilla Naidu said. According
to police information, the woman left the Sydenham Retirement Village in Wayne
Street with the suspect and the couple promised to return 6 days later. The
suspect reportedly also resides at the retirement village.
