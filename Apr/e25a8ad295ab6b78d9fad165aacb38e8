Bloemfontein Celtic have switched the venue of their Absa Premiership clash against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday to Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, Limpopo. The game had been initially set down for the Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein, Free State. But after the incident that took place in their last match against Cape Town City, the venue is not in a condition to host a match as parts of the stadium have been damaged. Angry Celtic fans invaded the pitch in protest over managementâ€™s poor running of Siwelele, leaving a path of destruction. The alternative venue, the Toyota Free State Stadium, is also unavailable as it will be hosting a Rugby match on the same day, Celtic revealed. Some of Celtic's supporters were not pleased by the decision to take the match to Limpopo, insisting there are other venues in the Free State that could have been considered.
