RESIDENTS of Folweni, Durban blocked the main road yesterday, demanding traffic lights on Umbumbulu Road. The road links the South Coast to Durban and Pietermaritzburg. They said they wouldn’t move from the road until eThekwini Municipality gave them a date when the traffic lights would be put up. Local leader Nkosinathi Gumede said since last year, they’ve been begging the municipality for the lights. “People are hit by speeding cars but nobody seems to care.” Resident Fikile Dlamini (35) said another problem is they have had no water since last month. Ward 95 Councillor Thokozani Xulu said he would only comment after meeting the residents. Leader Sibonelo Cele said it was now two weeks that they’d had no water and they’ve been waiting for speed humps since last year. Councillor Bonke Chili said he has told officials about the water problem, which was due to a continued strike at the municipal water and sanitation department. Municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the mayor would attend to their problems once she has finished attending to the floods. Captain Nqobile Gwala said they were keeping an eye on protests.
