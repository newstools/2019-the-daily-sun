POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has urged the family and friends of a cop who was shot and killed while on duty to wait for investigations to be concluded. Bheki was speaking during the funeral service of Constable Nkanyiso Biyela (27) at Cato Manor, west of Durban, on Saturday. Nkanyiso, who was stationed at Sydenham cop shop, was gunned down on the M19 road near the Mountbatten Drive off-ramp last Monday. Cele said Nkanyiso’s family should walk tall as their son died while on duty. He said he was asked several times why he wasn’t wearing his uniform as he was on duty. “I’ve been explaining to people that Nkanyiso wasn’t wearing his uniform because he was busy with a project which required him to wear private clothes,” said Cele. “We should wait for a proper investigation into what really happened,” he said. “I’ve requested a report on everything regarding this matter. The station commander will keep the family updated.” Nkanyiso was apparently shot by a suspect parked on the side of the highway. He wasn’t wearing uniform at the time of the shooting and was with colleagues when they noticed the car and went to investigate. The occupant apparently opened fire, mistaking them for hijackers. He handed himself in. Nkanyiso was declared dead on the scene. His uncle, Newyear Manqele, described Nkanyiso as loving and fun. “He will really be missed by everyone in the family. He always wanted to see the family happy,” he said. He said Nkanyiso had a seven-month-old baby and worked in the SAPS for three years. “At the moment, we really don’t know what led to his death. We will wait for the investigation,” said Manqele.
