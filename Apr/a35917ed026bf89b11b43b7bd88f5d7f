PETER Maepa is an angry man. He said police are not following leads they’ve been given to find his 20-year-old son, Lehlohonolo Maepa. Peter (50), from Mandela Village near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga, said one of his son’s friends claims to know who took his son. But when Peter told cops about it,no action was taken. Peter said since his son’s disappearance in September last year, he’s had no peace. “I spend sleepless nights thinking about him. “His friend told me he knows who kidnapped my son. “I told police about it and they promised to come within an hour, but they never did,” Peter said. Peter’s wife Elizabeth Maepa (49) said her son’s disappearance has caused tension in the family. “Since my son disappeared I am always thinking about him. I don’t know if he’s still alive or not. “I’m confused and don’t know what to do.” Lehlohonolo was kidnapped with his friend at gunpoint in September. Daily Sun ran the story headlined: “Taken at gunpoint” on 18 October last year. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a senior officer has been assigned to the case. He said it’s not that previous investigators did nothing, but they did not find anything. He said Peter should talk to the officer assigned to the case.
