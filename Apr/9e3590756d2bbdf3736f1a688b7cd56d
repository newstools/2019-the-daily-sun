EFF members yesterday blockaded the gate at Pharmed Pharmaceuticals at Riverhorse Valley Business Estate in Durban. They demanded wage increases and better treatment of workers. They also called on “racists and abusive staff members” to be axed. Workers downed tools and left the building to support the protesters. The EFF’s eThekwini regional chairman, Tholithemba Mthiyane, said the workers had asked the party to intervene on their behalf, claiming management did not listen to them. He said the workers had complained about a staff member who allegedly abused and assaulted them. “We can’t have people working overtime without being paid,” he said. The Imperial logistics marketing executive Michelle Neilson said: “I can confirm that all staff have gone back to work and that the EFF contingent has dispersed. Prior to the commencement of the protest action none of the stated grievances or complaints were lodged with the company or any dispute resolution processes followed as provided for by the Labour Relations Act. “Most of the demands presented focus on wage increases. We advised employees that wage and related demands must be channelled via the upcoming wage negotiations with the two registered trade unions. “With regards to the staff member allegedly abused them a thorough and expansive investigation found him innocent of all charges,” she said.
