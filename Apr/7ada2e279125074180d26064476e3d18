WORSHIPPERS gathered to remember the 13 people who died when their church collapsed on them last Thursday. The service was held yesterday in Empangeni, KZN. Samkelisiwe Mzila, Thandazo Dube, Minenhle Mdluli, Nonkanyiselo Shandu, Nokuthula Hlongwane, Alice Mhlongo, Lungi Mcambi, Bongekile Masondo, Ntando Mlondi, Thule Ncube, Mthabela Andiswa, Thembi Mthabela and Alta Langao died when the wall at Pentecostal Holiness Churchoutside Empangeni collapsed. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant, KZN Premier Willies Mchunu, Co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda and local mayors attended the service. Oliphant thanked the victims’ families for understanding the investigation process. “The situation forced the investigation to start immediately after the collection of the bodies. “This saw families and church members being stopped from going to the church. They couldn’t collect their loved ones’ belongings.” She said the cleaning operation and collection of belongings only took place after the investigators agreed. “The report is not yet available but we promise once it is, it will be made public.” Mchunu said: “Provincial government committed to help rebuild the collapsed building.” A representative of one of the families said: “We thank the entire nation for its condolences.”
