THEY ARE known as Winter Stock because they provide tons of warmth when the temperature drops. But the plus-size ladies claim to be misunderstood. “WE DESERVE TO BE APPRECIATED – AND NOT ONLY IN WINTER!” “In fact, we are the ones with the good hearts,” said Noxolo Mpangazitha from Carletonville, Gauteng. “We are loving and are good at taking care of our husbands.” She told the SunTeam they have formed a group called the Plus-size Women With Confidence. “We meet every second week and encourage one another to be confident and proud of ourselves.” She said some of the plus-size women were afraid to leave their homes because they were ashamed of being labelled. “We want plus-size women to know they matter,” she said. Mabontle Mphosi, founder of the brand Sdudla Chronicles, told Daily Sun that people who call them Winter Stock don’t know what they are talking about. “We are used to it but it doesn’t go down well with us. We want people to shift from that mindset. “We are really not only good for winter. We are great in spring, summer and autumn as well. In fact, we are good 365 days of the year,” she said. “I want to inspire large divas so that when they are called sdudla, its something they are proud of because that’s who they are.” Helen Mogoba told the People’s Paper they started a group called Curvybody SA which also aims to instil confidence in larger women and make people appreciate them all year round. Syabonga Mbatha told Daily Sun: “It’s wrong to call our thick ladies winter stock. They are gorgeous and they have great personalities.” Duma Khanyile said: “I’m not married for now. “In winter I find myself a thick diva and in summer I get a slender lady. But the day I choose to marry I will go for a thick diva.”
