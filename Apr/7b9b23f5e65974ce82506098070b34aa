THE mob accused the man of robbery and rape and wanted to set him on fire but the cops managed to stop them. But the cops couldn’t protect his two cars. Police arrived at the Zimbabwean’s rented room in extension 6, Nellmapius, Tshwane on Wednesday claiming a lost phone was tracked to the man. When cops found a balaclava, crowbar, phones and other electrical appliances in the man’s house, the residents went mad. They had suspected the man for some time for a string of robberies in their kasi and some even accused him of rape. Within minutes, the man and police were surrounded by residents demanding that they should hand the man over. Police called for back-up and the man was rescued and arrested. Residents wanted to torch the house, but a neighbour said he was a tenant and residents pushed the man’s two cars into the open and set them on fire. Nyaope smokers immediately started stripping the cars. Even as the cars were burning, the addicts were still trying to pull off metal parts. A resident told Daily Sun the man was definitely responsible for break-ins. “He wasn’t working but he sold electrical appliances. The balaclava and crowbar prove he is a crook. He deserved what he got,” he said. He said the man’s wife fled. Gauteng police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the man was arrested on charges of rape and theft. He said cases of malicious damage to property and public violence were also opened, but no one has been arrested. He said the suspect will appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court soon.
