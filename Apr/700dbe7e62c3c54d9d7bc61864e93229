IT started as a fight over blankets and now Lucky’s wife Mmegane (35) and his daughter Mohumutsi (4) are missing. Lucky Phetla (36) from Mpumalanga and his wife fought on 11 April. According to Lucky, wet blankets in the house needed to be hung out. When he asked two of his daughters to hang them, his wife stopped them. “I then asked her to help me hang them. “She became aggressive, but I ignored her.” He said his wife helped him but became violent. “I tried to avoid her, but she continued to argue and even threatened to kill me.” He said his wife threatened to report him to the police, and that was the last time she saw them. Lucky said a neighbour told him she had seen his wife and child on the highway and he launched a search with the help of residents. “I called her relatives, but they said they were not around,” he said. “I can’t sleep or eat. I wonder where they are.” Constable George Mahlangu said two missing person’s cases were opened.
