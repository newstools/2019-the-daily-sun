A MPUMALANGA pastor and his nephew were burnt to death yesterday by the community for allegedly killing two siblings. Bheki Malumane (36) and Wonder Mbuyane (24) allegedly confessed to killing Nontokozo Qibi (5) and Slindile Qibi (6) on Tuesday in Mganduzweni, outside White River. The siblings’ naked bodies were found by community members dumped under a tree near a stream. A resident said the community consulted a prophet to tell them who killed the girls. The prophet pointed out the pastor and three other suspects. After learning the names of the alleged suspects, residents searched their houses and allegedly found bloodstains on a mattress, a bowl full of blood, and clothes covered in blood. “We’re very disappointed because we trusted the pastor, a man of God. We didn’t think he would do this. We trusted him with our kids, we would even allow our kids to play in his house,” said the resident. She said the suspects allegedly confessed to killing the girls. This was allegedly not the first time they had committed such a crime. They apparently admitted to taking body parts of their victims to a woman in Hazyview. Another community member said: “the community sent a message that murderers were not wanted in their community. “This is not the first time the community has experienced the brutal killing of children. They deserve what they got. We will continue to work as a community because the justice system continues to fail us,” she said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police had opened another case of murder. He urged residents to stop taking the law into their own hands. “We spoke to them yesterday regarding the issue of taking the law into their own hands because its gonna hamper the investigation, but they didn’t heed the call,” said Hlathi.
