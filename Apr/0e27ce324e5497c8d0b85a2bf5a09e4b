 HIS plan to Fill-up the Peter Mokaba Stadium over the weekend
didn’t go according to plan, but the Xitsonga traditional music icon Benny
Mayengani has something to smile about. On Monday, he had a bride welcoming party in his home
village after paying lobola on Good Friday. He told Daily Sun
that he paid Lobola for his fiancé Cynthia Ngobeni and held a massive bridal
traditional welcoming ceremony in Shawela village outside Giyani, Limpopo. Mayengani says he has been with Cynthia for four years and
he is delighted that they got married and will live happily ever after.  "The lobola process was completed on Good Friday and it
was already planned that on Easter-Monday we will have a welcoming ceremony for
her into my family." "There was no way the ceremony could be cancelled due
to what happened at Peter Mokaba Stadium. I had to carry on with life, it’s
part of life and I am very glad that the welcoming ceremony went well," he
said.  "I was as overwhelmed by their support as I didn’t
expect such a large number of people, my plan was to have a small ceremony as I
will be having a big wedding celebration soon," he added. The music icon who is also a politician has been under
attack recently on social media platforms after the #Fillup Peter Mokaba
Stadium initiative didn’t go well. He says he has done enough for his home province and its
time that he takes his initiative and explore other provinces.  "I have done good things for my province and now it’s
time that I take this creativity to Joburg, where I also have amazing support,"
Mayengani told Daily Sun.
