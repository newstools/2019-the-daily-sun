JOBURG mayor Herman Mashaba has announced the biggest property investment the City of Joburg has ever made. Mashaba said through the release of city properties to the private sector for redevelopment, the city expected to gain R20 billion in investment value. This value will soon be visible in the inner city in 24 different property developments, said Mashaba. This is in addition to the three developments already under way in Hillbrow and Newtown. Mashaba said the developments were part of a number of properties released to the private sector in 2017. He said the 71 properties, which were part of the Joburg inner city revitalisation programme, were in addition to the 13 properties initially released by council. He said this was the biggest number of properties awarded at the same time in the city’s history. “This is also the largest number of mixed-use private sector developments focusing on residential and student accommodation being facilitated by the city at once,” he said. He said the council recently held talks with universities to discuss how it could help turn some buildings into student accommodation. “We intend to change the inner city into a construction site as we seek to create jobs and improve the Joburg economy,” he said. Construction will begin within six months and will include properties in central Joburg, Yeoville, Berea, Vrededorp, Fairview, Salisbury, Marshalltown, Wolhuter and Turffontein. In total, he expects the first group of developments to create 10 096 job opportunities and provide 6 500 housing units. Rent in the new developments is said to cost between R900 and R4 500 a month, excluding services. “If people want to stay in Sandton because its closer to their place of work, they should be able to do so at an affordable cost,” he said
