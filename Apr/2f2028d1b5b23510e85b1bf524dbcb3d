WHEN her father, George Ngobeni, gave her the name Hlupheka, meaning struggle, it was like a curse. Hlupeka Ngobeni (55) has been looking for her mum for years after her father and his lover took her away in 1966, when she was only two. Hlupheka, from Zakheni Village near KwaMhlanga, said she grew up struggling on farms and never went to school. When her father died, he was still refusing to help her find her mum. She said her mum has been visiting her in her dreams since 2001, without saying a word. “I was raised by another woman who never cared about me. She said I would never get married or have children and it proved true. I cannot find a job and survive by selling cooked maize. “All I need is to find my mother, her family and my siblings. If she is no more, I would love to see her grave and get closure.” Hlupheka said her mum was Emily Ledwaba from Sekgokgoshi Village in Limpopo. She said her father told her she had three siblings, whose names he had forgotten.
