A 38-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly hitting his son with a hammer. The 12-year-old boy was admitted to hospital for scars and bruises but he is now safely back with his mother. The mother (31) said the man, her boyfriend, allegedly attacked her with a hammer but she was able to fight him off. “But my son is too small to fight back,” she said. “I’m grateful he is alive and want that man to stay behind bars forever.” The alleged attack happened on Wednesday night at the room the couple rents in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. The woman told Daily Sun each time he came home drunk he called her names and hit her. “On that night, he came home drunk and accused me of cheating. I decided to leave. I left our son because I thought he was safe with his father. “Then I got a call from neighbours to say my son was screaming for help and I called the police. Fortunately they responded quickly and we went to the room.” Police spokesman Captain Manyaza Ralidziba said: “The suspect was arrested the same night and faces a charge of assault.”
