HE tried to steal the copper cable but he touched the wrong wires – and it cost him his life. When the man touched the cable carrying 33 000kv power, his gloves did not help him. He was instantly burnt to an unrecognisable shell of a human being. The incident left Bloemfontein residents without electricity for some time, as the man lay dead on top of an electricity box at Naval Park on Saturday. Oil leaked from the box after the explosion. Resident Samuel Nkosi (47) said: “He obviously had some knowledge about electricity, because he was wearing gloves. But he met his match in such a powerful cable.” Lele Mamatu, spokesman for the Mangaung municipal power supplier Centlec, urged people to respect electricity because it is dangerous. Police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Thabo Covane confirmed the incident. He said Navalsig police had opened an inquest docket. The dead man’s identity is unknown.
