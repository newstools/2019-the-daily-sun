  A mob in Mpumalanga
burnt two men to death at Mganduzweni in White River. Police
spokesperson Brigadier Lenard Hlathi said the police have opened two counts of
murder case. The
community accused the men for killing two toddlers, which reportedly resulted in
the angry residents mobilising and torching their houses and kill them. He said the
police have already launched a manhunt for the suspects who have killed the two
men and expect to make an arrest as soon. Hlathi said
one of the suspects is the pastor of a local church. The
accident came after two siblings aged five and six went missing on Tuesday and
were found dead in the bushes near a stream in Mganduzweni.
