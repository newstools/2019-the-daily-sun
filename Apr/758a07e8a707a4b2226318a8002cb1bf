IMFEZEMNYAMA has taken the plunge! The multi-award winning maskandi artist, Phumlani Khumalo, had a traditional engagement party with long-time sweetheart Phumelele Msibi on Saturday. He paid lobola to her family before holding a party at her home in Newcastle, KZN. Imfezemnyama told Daily Sun they met in Joburg in 2011. “We started dating in the same year and have been together for eight years,” he said. “I had enough time to realise she’s the one. I love her because she respects me. “As a king of maskandi, I realise I have to be married. You can’t lead other maskandi musicians if you’re not married. “We haven’t set a date for our wedding but have started preparing for it.” He said he’s the king of maskandi as he’s released music with three bands. “I release three times a year. I’ve released Amabunjwa, Indiya and Imfezemnyama albums every year since 2010,” he said.
