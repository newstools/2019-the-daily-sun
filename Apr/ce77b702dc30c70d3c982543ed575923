A
man in northern Mexico had to be rescued after he accidentally trapped himself
in a hole. He
allegedly dug the hole so he could spy on his former girlfriend in violation of
a court order to stay away from her, authorities said on Sunday. The
Sonora state attorney general's office said the 50-year-old man had spent days
digging the hole in Puerto Penasco, a town on the Gulf of California, only to
become trapped and require assistance to get out. The
man had been ordered to stay away from his former girlfriend due to domestic
violence charges and he is now in jail, authorities said. The
newspaper El Universal said the man dug a tunnel under the woman's house. It
said the woman told police that over the course of a week, she had heard
scratching noises but assumed the noise was cats. But when the sound grew
louder, she investigated and found her former partner of 14 years trapped
below, the report said. She said she ended the relationship because her partner
was very jealous. Police
said the man appeared intoxicated and severely dehydrated once they got him out
of the tunnel. Gender
violence is in Mexico's spotlight this week after a woman was hit by a car and
then stabbed to death by her husband outside the governor's residence in the
western state of Jalisco. That incident was captured on video. SOURCE:
