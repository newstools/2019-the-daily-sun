SUNREADERS have lashed out at Christianity. This comes after actor Phila Madlingozi recently posted on Instagram that Christianity had almost totally destroyed black spirituality. Speaking to Daily Sun, national co-ordinator of Traditional Healers Organisation Phepsile Maseko said many young people were beginning to exclusively practice their own tradition and shying away from Christianity. She said Christianity brainwashed African people. Maseko said: “People can choose any religion they desire, but it shouldn’t be done at the expense of tradition and African spirituality.” She said people should be given the freedom to practise their beliefs without the fear of being called names. “People should not hide when they consult a sangoma because of civilisation,” said Maseko. Bishop Thys Molekoa of Holy St John’s dismissed the idea that Christianity did not allow African people to practise tradition and spirituality. “Any Christian who believes in appeasing ancestors as it was done in the olden days can do so. “We absolutely do not deem Christianity as a religion that belongs to a different race, because we are one in the eyes of God.” Here is what SunReaders think about Christianity and African spirituality: “African spirituality caused depression for me and left me with lots of unanswered questions. I am okay with Jesus. Forward I go. I trust Him totally.”
