RESIDENTS of Kokstad’s ward 10  will no longer have to live without electricity. Electrification of the area in Harry Gwala Municipality, southern KZN, has been completed. The project was unveiled on Thursday by Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube, Greater Kokstad mayor Bheki Mtolo, and Harry Gwala mayor Mluleki Ndobe. The R9 million electrification project has benefited 850 homes. Resident Nomahomba Mkhize (58) from Shayamoya cried tears of joy. “With winter near, I’m happy my family will now be able to keep warm and prepare a quick meal, thanks to the electricity provided by the government. “We were exposed to great suffering when we had to fetch firewood in the forest.” Dube-Ncube said the ward’s electrification marked 100% access to electricity for residents of the Greater Kokstad Municipality. Dube-Ncube said 100% access had already been achieved by other municipalities, and it was a big milestone in the province’s efforts to ensure residents had access to basic services. Speaking at Bhongweni Youth Centre, Dube-Ncube said the hard work of local leaders had ensured access to electricity. “As provincial government, we celebrate with Kokstad residents as we kick off the province’s celebration of 25 years of freedom in style. “This is a sign of this government’s commitment to the creation of a better future for all our residents. “Electricity changes lives, and we can see this in Kokstad today.” Unveiling a state-of-the-art fire engine and two waste compactor trucks, she said these would also help the municipality deliver services.
