TWO trains were set alight in Cape Town on Sunday afternoon. This came two weeks after President Cyril Ramaphosa unveiled new trains in the city. Fire and Rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse said eight coaches were destroyed, but no injuries were reported. United National Transport Union spokeswoman Sonja Carstens said they were left horrified and disgusted by the incident. “We have always stated there is a third force behind the torching of trains. The police and Prasa have not been able to arrest anyone in connection with the torching of 54 trains over the last 18 months. This is a huge challenge,” she said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the incident was being investigated. “It was discovered that a train on platform 13 was on fire. The fire spread to platform 14 where another train caught alight. The motive is unknown and no one has been arrested yet.”
