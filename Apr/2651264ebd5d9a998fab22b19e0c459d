The Hawks have launched a massive manhunt for Dr Levy Makgatho after he failed
to comply with a court order. Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said in 2012 Makgatho was
allegedly an employee at one the hospitals in Mpumalanga. He reportedly had two surgeries in operation, whereby he employed foreign
nationals without genuine qualifications. Sekgotodi said the accused collected money fraudulently from
different medical aid schemes. Makgatho was arrested in June 2012 by the Hawks for fraud, after his underhand
dealings were uncovered.   Sekgotodi said on the 18th October 2017 Makgatho was found guilty and convicted
by the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrate Court. "He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment or a fine of R10 000 which
sentence is wholly suspended for a period of five years on condition that the
accused pays by way of a compensatory fine of an amount of R185 000 to Bonitas
Medical aid scheme, directly at an amount of R7 000 per month starting
from 31 January 2018," she said. No payment has been received to date according to Bonitas Medical fund and on
30th November 2018, the Court issued an order for Makgatho’s apprehension. It is believed that the accused last residential address was in Lebanon in
Mabopane. Sekgotodi urged anyone with information which can assist in solving the matter to
contact investigation officer Warrant Matsobane France Aphane on 082 303 9759.
