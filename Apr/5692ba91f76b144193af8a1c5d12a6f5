THE Qibi family in Mganduzweni, outside White River in Mpumalanga, are struggling to cope after the death of their two daughters. Nontokozo (5) and Silindile Qibi (6) went missing on Tuesday afternoon. The two sisters left home to visit their gogo in another section. Their naked bodies were discovered yesterday dumped under a tree near a stream. They had allegedly been kidnapped. According to their gogo, Phumzile Sifundza, the two girls always visited her after school. She told Daily Sun they launched a search with the help of residents. “We went to search all suspicious houses. “We even went to search where they were found but had no luck. “We couldn’t sleep because we were hoping that we would at least find them but it turned out for the worst. “It was hard to believe when we received a call this morning to say their bodies were found lying near a stream. “We will never forget this day and hope that the killer is arrested.” Phumzile said the family is shattered and had high hopes for the children’s future. “It’s still hard to believe because these children were still very young. “They didn’t deserve to die like this,” she said. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said police are investigating two cases of murder. He asked residents to assist with information that could lead to an arrest.
