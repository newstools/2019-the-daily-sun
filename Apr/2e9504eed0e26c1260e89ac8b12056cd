 Residents of Ironside in Vereeniging have vowed that blood
will be spilled should Red Ants touch their shacks. This comes after Red Ants arrived in the area with over 15
trucks and parked them at the De Deur Police Station as they awaited
instructions. The Red Ants are in the area to evict people who reportedly
occupied a piece of land in Ironside in the Vaal.  The residents blockaded roads in the area, as they waited
for the Red Ants to arrive. They further said they will put their lives on the line and
threatened to respond with violence if their shacks were demolished. This is a developing story.
