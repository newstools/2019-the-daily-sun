A FRIENDSHIP between two men who had the same surname ended tragically on Sunday. Zama Zondi (42) accidentally shot his best friend Sinekosi Zondi (26) dead while drunk, and then turned his gun on himself. The incident apparently happened when the two friends from Matimatolo, KZN, were drinking with three other men. The trouble started when Zama took out his gun and started playing with it. He accidentally pulled the trigger and shot Sinekosi. Zama rushed Sinekosi to hospital, but he died on the way. Shocked and terrified, Zama then drove the body to a nearby cliff and threw it off. He apparently called Sinekosi’s family to explain what had happened and then shot himself. A police source told Daily Sun the two men were very close and were neighbours. “They were not blood relatives, but shared a surname and used to hang around together all the time. They referred to each other as brother,” said the cop. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “A murder case and an inquest docket were opened at Matimatolo Police Station,” she said. The SunTeam couldn’t reach the families of Zama or Sinekosi.
