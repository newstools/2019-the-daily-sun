SHE’S earned the nickname of Prophet Maskotlolo because she allegedly traps demons in a waskom – and she claims it has been proved to be working. Prophet Nomsa Mbulawa (41) from Waterworks squatter camp near Protea Glen, Soweto said she trapped the spirits in the waskom and destroyed them by fire. “I’m often called by people who are haunted by evil spirits and tokoloshes to chase them away from their homes and yards,” said Maskotlolo, which means basin. “Last month I went to a house after the owner told me her daughter was struggling to sleep.” She said she went to pray and perform rituals and a horrible creature was found in the house. Daniel Mahlaba said he had a tokoloshe problem ay his house. “We never slept at night. Every night at 9pm, something knocked on my roof and again at 4am,” he said. “But these days I can sleep peacefully after the prophet cast away the demons.”
