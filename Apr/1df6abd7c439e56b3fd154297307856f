WHILE everyone was asleep yesterday he broke into the local supermarket through the roof. He found himself in the bakery section of the Usave store in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. So he sat down and started eating cake. All kinds of different cakes. Then he moved on to the pie section where he had all the pies he could eat. But that wasn’t enough. He ate some biscuits for dessert. At last, with his tummy stretched and full, he tried to get back up through the roof. But his full tummy wouldn’t let him bounce back up and that was his downfall! Cops confirmed that the man was arrested in the storeroom of a Shoprite Usave yesterday. Katlehong police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe said: “At about 4.30am police arrested a 29-year-old man in Shoprite Usave supermarket for burglary.” He said that police were patrolling at Moleleki extension 1 when they received a call about a burglary in progress. “When the police arrived at the scene, noises were heard in the shop. “The store manager arrived and opened the building for the police. The suspect was found hiding inside a storeroom,” said the cop. He said the suspect cut through the roof and ceiling to enter the shop. “The suspect’s bag was full of biscuits and pies,” said Ndobe.
