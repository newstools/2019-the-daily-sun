KANYAMAZANE in Mpumalanga will come alive tomorrow when the MultiChoice Diski Shield competition hits town. The Diski Shield, an extension of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC), is set to crown a new champion in its second edition after defending champions Kaizer Chiefs were knocked out. KaNyamazane Stadium will host the semi-finals of the tournament tomorrow with Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United, Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows all vying for a spot in the final. The Young Matsatsantsa and last year’s losing finalists Masandawana, will kick-off the semi-final action when they lock horns in a Tshwane Derby at noon. Downs will be hoping to progress once more to this year’s final, where they will have a chance to right the wrongs of the previous campaign. Later on in the day, Abafana Bes’thende will tackle first time semi-finalists Bucs in the final match at 3pm. Two-time MDC champions Arrows, who finished third in last year’s competition, will be hoping to go all the way this time around. Arrows’ reserve team coach, Vusi Vilakazi, said his charges are determined to get their hands on the Diski Shield title and end the season with some silverware “The boys are fully focused and ready for battle,” said Vilakazi. “We are aware that we didn’t have the best of seasons in the MDC, but we can make up for it by winning this competition. We can’t settle for third place like last year.”
