KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp is hoping his charges bring their A-game once again in their Absa Premiership clash against Golden Arrows on Tuesday. Amakhosi were at their best at the weekend as they smashed Chippa United 4-2 to book a spot in the Nedbank Cup final where they will face TS Galaxy. Middendorp, who watched his team produce a similarly stunning performance in their Ke Yona Cup quarter-final a few weeks ago, was left frustrated when they went down to Baroka the very next game. The German tactician would not like to see a repeat of that against Abafana Besthende, instead, he is hoping they perform as they have been doing in the Mzansi version of the FA Cup. “We played a high intensity match on Saturday. The players gave their all against Chippa United. The game was fast-paced. I just hope the guys have recovered well to give a repeat of Saturday’s performance,” Middendorp told his club’s website. “We are in a similar situation to that after the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal, remember, after the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal against Cape Town City, we faced Baroka FC at home for a league fixture, we learned a few lessons from that situation, and we have used that to prepare for Arrows.” Amakhosi are out of contention for Absa Premiership honours and only have a top eight spot to play for. Their opponents, Arrows, head to the encounter on the back of a stinging 3-1 defeat at the hands of National First Division (NFD) outfit TS Galaxy in the cup. Middendorp is wary of Steve Komphela’s charges who will be looking to bounce back from the defeat, at their expense. “Arrows are a good team,” added Middendorp. “They have some enterprising players, while Lerato Lamola is a seasoned and proven marksman. “At the end of the day we want to win and collect the three points. It won’t be easy, but we are ready to win this one.”
