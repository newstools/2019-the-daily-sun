FOR two days, cops searched tirelessly for the body of an alleged zama zama. The man allegedly jumped into Wammer Pan Dam to run away from police. His body was found by the K9 search and rescue unit yesterday. The zama zama was being chased by police after he allegedly shot dead a fellow illegal miner at Wemmer, outside Joburg. Police spokesman Captain Jeff Phora said: “According to our investigations, the two guys had an argument on Tuesday and one took out a firearm and shot the other. “Paramedics came to the scene and declared him dead.” “He drowned and our divers were called in to search for him,” he said. They were now investigating cases of murder.
