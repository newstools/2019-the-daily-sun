WAVING the old South African flag is an insult to black apartheid victims. This is what the South African Human Rights Commission told the Equality Court in Joburg on Monday during a hate speech case against lobby group AfriForum. The commission’s legal representative, Wim Trengove, said people displaying the old flag sent a harmful message. “If people go around waving the flag, what they clearly mean is they celebrate apartheid South Africa. They say, we yearn for the good old days where white people were celebrated and black people humiliated. The old flag reinforces a racist message.” Trengove said these people didn’t identify with the new South Africa. The Nelson Mandela Foundation, which took the matter to court, said there was no debate that the apartheid flag was a symbol of racial domination. “AfriForum wants to say it is possible for the old flag to be seen in a way other than a symbol of racism,” said commission lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi. He said the group deliberately and falsely represented history. The case was triggered by the display of the old flag at a Black Monday march against farm murders in October 2017. Ngcukaitobi said if the court accepted AfriForum’s argument, it would allow people to use images of a baboon on a black man’s body, adding the symbolism of the old apartheid flag was that of racism. Justice Minister Michael Masutha supported the application for the waving of the old flag to be viewed as hate speech. AfriForum agreed that waving the flag in public was hurtful, saying it stopped members from waving it, but said banning it was attacking free speech.
