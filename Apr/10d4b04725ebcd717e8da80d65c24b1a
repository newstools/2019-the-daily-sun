IT only took a few minutes after the smoke came from the back seat before pupils leapt from the Quantum taxi. Then the smoke got worse and soon the taxi was swallowed by flames. It was completely burnt out on Malandela Road in KwaMashu on Friday. Luckily, nobody was injured. The taxi was taking pupils from Sivananda and Isibonelo high schools. According to a 16-year-old pupil, they were sitting in the taxi when they smelled smoke from the back seat. Pupils started coughing and the driver told them to jump out. “We all jumped out and watched as the smoke got worse. “Another driver stopped his taxi and gave our driver a fire extinguisher. At that time, there were flames from the sound system of the taxi. “They tried to extinguish the fire but it got out of control. Then the entire taxi went up in flames,” the pupil said. “The driver just stood back helplessly and watched the taxi burn. “I’m glad we managed to escape unharmed. “If we hadn’t jumped out, we would have burnt to death.” The pupils said the taxi often fetched them from school and was heading towards the Ntuzuma area. The driver said he was in shock. KZN cop spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said no case was opened.
