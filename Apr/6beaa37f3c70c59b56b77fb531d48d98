FREE State Stars captain Paulos Masehe is confident that they will survive the dreaded drop this season. Ea Lla Koto are currently out of the danger zone in 12th spot with 26 points from 27 games. However, they are by no means home and dry just yet and will have to continue fighting for their top flight status in the three remaining games of the season. Masehe believes they have enough quality and experience to stay clear of the dreaded axe. Ea Lla Koto travel to the Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban next to lock horns with top eight chasing Golden Arrows (3.pm). “We have been in this situation a couple of times, and we know how to handle the situation,” Masehe told his club’s official website. “The guys are focused and looking forward to get maximum points against Arrows on Sunday. “As long as you don’t lose matches you are in a right track and we definitely running our own race, we not bothered about other teams, and we will fight until the very last match.” Abafana Besthende on the other hand, occupy tenth spot on the standings with 33 points from 27 games. Steve Komphela’s charges head into the clash on the back of a morale boosting 1-1 draw with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs on Tuesday.
