COPS say abuse is abuse and is treated the same, no matter who the victim or who the suspect. They were reacting to a video of a man being klapped by a woman. It is not known when and where the video was taken, but it started doing the rounds on social media early this week. In the video, the woman klaps the man on the face several times. He does not respond to the beating. Men said this was man abuse and it was sad as it happened everywhere, but was not given the attention it deserved. Scelo Ndima told the People’s Paper he used to be abused by his woman, but could do nothing about it. “I was beaten and made to cook and wash clothes. I thought I was being a nice guy until I realised it was just abuse. “I left, but the sad part is she got someone who didn’t put up with her behaviour and they beat each other up every day,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said: “Police officials who do not assist someone open an abuse case can also be charged. “People should be assisted irrespective of race, colour, religion or sex.”
