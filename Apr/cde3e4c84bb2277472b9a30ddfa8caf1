“TEACHERS, if you have bullies at school, give them books and you will see them change.” Phakama Matoti from the national library said this at a reading competition at Khayelitsha Library in Cape Town on World Book Day. Pupils from 13 schools took part on Tuesday. Matoti told pupils they must get used to reading. “Start by reading magazines in a language you understand,” said Matoti. Senior librarian Vuyokazi Rani-Njambatha said the decision to stage the annual competition was taken because kids in most schools did not spend much time reading. “We stage the competition every year. It is to give them the chance to see how good they are at reading. We want them to get used to reading,” she said. They used a prescribed grade 8 book. Buyile Nomnganga, a teacher at Kukhanyile High School, said the competition would give pupils confidence. Siphesihle Gatyeni (12) won the English category. Gcisa Nyathi (12) was the IsiXhosa category winner. “There was no way I could have not won reading in my home language,” she said.
