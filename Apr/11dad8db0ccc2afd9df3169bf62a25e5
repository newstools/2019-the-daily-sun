In a
case of counting your chickens before they hatch, DA Gauteng premier candidate
Solly Msimanga announced plans for his first 100 days in office as premier. Speaking
at the event at Beyers Naude Square just behind the Gauteng Legislature in
Johannesburg, Msimanga made it known that he won't be tolerating any corruption
in his government. Top
of the Tshwane's former mayors’ plans is setting up a commission of inquiry
into provincial state capture. "The
Zondo commission has exposed the incredible level of corruption in our country
but shining a light on the problem is only the first step, and in fact, it is
the smallest step," Msimanga said. Msimanga
said he is looking at people like Thuli Madonsela to head up the commission. Still,
on the corruption front, Msimanga said that he wants to re-establish the Scorpions
or a provincial version of the crime-busting unit. "I
will establish the Gauteng Scorpions to investigate high-level corruption in
the province. “The
Gauteng Scorpions should be headed up by a respected professional in the field
that should operate independently," Msimanga said. Msimanga
said that if the NPA fails to prosecute the cases brought by the provincial his
government will explore other means of prosecution like private prosecution. Corruptions
were not the only thing on Msimanga's plans. He talked about ensuring that officials
in his government are kept in check using the ministerial handbook which he
will be launching. “The
handbook will cap the benefits, perks and privilege of the Premier, Speaker and
MECs, immediately limiting the amount of overseas travel which will need to be
approved by the Cabinet," Msimanga said.
