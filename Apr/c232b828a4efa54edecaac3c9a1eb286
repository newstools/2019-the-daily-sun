WE’RE sangomas, not witches! Gatvol sangomas protesting on Saturday said they are sick of the bad treatment they get. Their protest was held at KwaThema Stadium in Ekurhuleni, where Gauteng Premier David Makhura was speaking to celebrate Freedom Day. One sangoma said: “People label us as witches. If something goes wrong in their neighbourhood, we are often the suspects, for no reason.” She said people don’t know the difference between witches, traditional healers and igedla. Sangoma Meisie Pienaar said: “Witches are the ones who cast evil spells. Traditional healers are there to heal and igedla specialise in digging and selling muthi. “There’s a difference and people must know that. We hate it when, for instance, my neighbour’s child gets sick and people point fingers at me.” She said they joined the Freedom Day celebrations to highlight their problem. “Being a sangoma is a calling. “We are part of a democratic society and we need to enjoy its fruit and not be chained by fear.” Sangomas told Daily Sun many of them have been killed or have lost their property when residents accused them wrongfully and they had to flee. Members of the Buyisa Traditional Healers organisation from Alexandra township told Daily Sun they wanted free access to the Jukskei River, so they could cleanse their patients. Eudy was killed on 28 April 2008 because she was a lesbian.
