THE brothers lived together and spent most of their time with one another. On Friday, Ayanda (37) and Talente Sibisi (36) from Richmond Farm, Ntuzuma, were found dead in their one-roomed house. They were allegedly shot on Thursday night and were found by a neighbour the next morning. The incident has left residents shocked and confused. Some residents believe the deaths could be related to a family fight, while others said one of the brothers worked for a druglord. A resident told Daily Sun: “The brothers used to live in a shack near their gogo’s house. When the gogo died, they moved into the house. I heard a family member also wanted gogo’s house. “The relative apparently wanted the brothers to leave, but they refused.” Another resident said one of the brothers drove a car for people who sold drugs. “Maybe he died because of drugs. Maybe he was the one who was supposed to be killed, but the gunmen shot both of them to get rid of the evidence,” the resident said. The brothers’ uncle, Mazwi Magwaza, said the family didn’t know why they were killed. “They lived together and if there was a third person in the house, maybe he or she could have told us what happened.” He denied the allegations about the house. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. “Murder cases were opened at Ntuzuma Police Station,” said Zwane.
