A NUMBER of reckless and negligent driving cases which were caught on camera are under investigation. This was revealed by Public Safety MMC Michael Sun during the Joburg Metro police monthly crime statistics report at the Council Chambers in Braamfontein, Joburg on Friday. The March report was delivered by Metro police chief David Tembe. It revealed that 804 motorists were bust for drunken driving and 15 for reckless and negligent driving. Eleven arrests were made for the possession of stolen goods and there were 18 nabs for the possession of hijacked or stolen vehicles. Eighteen people were bust for robbery and seven for the possession of drugs. Tembe said the arrests were the result of having cops placed every 10 to 15km on the freeways. The gathering also paid tribute to 10 cops who had gone beyond the call of duty. Soweto cop Phumzile Mkhwanzi was saluted for helping a pregnant rape victim assaulted by the suspect. She successfully arrested the man and secured a conviction.
