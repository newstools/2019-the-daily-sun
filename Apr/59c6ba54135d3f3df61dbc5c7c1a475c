THE Stormers have released their 25-man squad that will travel to
Argentina on Tuesday ahead of their Super Rugby encounter with the
Jaguares in Buenos Aires this weekend. The Stormers will be
looking for their second win against the Jaguares this season when they run out
at the Estadio Jose Amalfitani at 9.40pm (SA time) on Saturday. Utility forwards Pieter-Steph
du Toit (shoulder) and Ernst van Rhyn (elbow) were ruled out of the touring
group through injury, while flank Siya Kolisi and prop Frans Malherbe will be
rested as part of the Springbok management plan. Loose forwards Jaco Coetzee
and Sikhumbuzo Notshe have both recovered from injuries and will make the trip. Stormers Head Coach Robbie
Fleck said that the players going to Argentina will be giving it everything to
secure another win. "We want to keep building
on our recent performances and this is a great opportunity to do so away from
home. "We have a bye after this
game before we are back at home, so we will be going flat-out this weekend in
Buenos Aires," he said. THE SQUAD Jaco Coetzee, Damian de Allende, Jean-Luc du Plessis, Johan du Toit, JJ
