NO floods will quench their thirst. KZN is flooding but shebeen patrons drowned their sorrows away with booze! A video shows people laughing and enjoying drinks while the water flows under their feet. “Don’t leave! Come back!” one man is heard calling to a woman who is walking away with a bottle of beer and a chair. Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesman Lennox Mabaso told Daily Sun such behaviour was hazardous. “People cannot be behaving this way while affected people are still reeling from losing their loved ones and properties.” Mabaso said people who were enjoying their booze around flooded areas were risking their lives. “Flooded areas can contain hazardous chemicals which are harmful to the body. “I don’t advise anyone to walk around such places.”
