IN A bid to offer financial assistance to deserving students who wish to further their studies, Pearson Institute of Higher Education is once again offering bursaries to qualifying applicants. According to Siegie Brownlee, executive director: Pearson Institute of Higher Education, 50 bursaries are on offer. Students must meet the qualifying criteria, and successful applicants will be enrolled during the May intake – depending on which courses they apply for. The offer is not extended to part-time students. “Our bursary programme ensures that deserving students, who may not have the financial means to advance their studies, have access to world-class higher education,” said Brownlee. Applications for bursaries are open to South African citizens who wish to study full time or part time towards qualifications on offer at any of the 12 Pearson Institute campuses across the country. Applicants must meet the minimum entrance requirements for the specific qualification they wish to study. They must hold a senior certificate or equivalent school leaving certificate, accompanied by a Saqa certificate of equivalence and/or USAF exemption certificate. Process:
