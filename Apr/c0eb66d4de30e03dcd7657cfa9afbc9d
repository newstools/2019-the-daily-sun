RELEGATION threatened Maritzburg United need all the support they can garner from fans if they are to survive the dreaded drop. The Team of Choice’s goalkeeper Richard Ofori is well aware of that and has pleaded with fans to rally behind the team as they attempt to stave off relegation. The KwaZulu Natal –based team enhanced their chances of survival with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. The crucial victory saw United reduce the gap on fellow relegation candidates Chippa United, who are now just a point better off. The job, though, is only half done for the Team of Choice, as they need maximum points in their remaining matches against SuperSport United and Baroka to give themselves a chance of staying up. “We thank the almighty God for this victory,” Ofori said on social media after the game. “We thank the fans, the whole city, and each and every one who has supported us. We know you guys are behind us, the battle is till on but we know we will overcome this battle.”
