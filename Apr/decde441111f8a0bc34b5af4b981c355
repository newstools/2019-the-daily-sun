residents to be careful. “We are urging residents especially in our low-lying areas
and informal settlements like Sjwetla, Kliptown to monitor water levels and go
to high ground when waters rise,” he said. Mulaudzi also urged parents to monitor their kids because to
avoid drowning incidents. “We are urging motorists to avoid roads which might be
flooded to avoid incidents of vehicles drowning,” he said. “We will remain on high alert, disaster managements
dispatched on 7 regions of the city to monitor the weather and the situation,”
he also said. “Residents are urged to keep eye on weather-related
