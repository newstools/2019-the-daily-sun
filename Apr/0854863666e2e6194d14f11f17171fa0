Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says that the Absa Premiership title race is not over “until the fat lady sings”. Sundowns are three points behind log leaders Orlando Pirates, but have a game in hand over the Soweto giants. However, the case pending against the Brazilians for fielding Wayne Arendse as an ineligible player is still pending for which Masandawana are likely to be docked a point. "They always it’s not over until the fat lady sings. She hasn't sung yet," said Mosimane, before Sundowns boarded their flight to Morocco to face Wydad Casablanca in the CAF Champions League first leg semi-final on Friday. “On paper, the league standings say I have 50 points, but in reality, I don’t know,” Mosimane said, in reference to the pending disciplinary case. “Until that thing [the sentence] comes out, I don’t know how many I have.” Mosimane's side moved level on points with Pirates on Tuesday with a 3-2 victory over Chippa United at Loftus Stadium, but the Buccaneers restored their three-point lead with a 1-0 win at Maritzburg United’s Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday night. On Friday evening Sundowns take on Wydad at 9pm SA time. -Sport24
