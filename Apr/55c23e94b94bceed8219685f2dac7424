BLACK Leopards coach Dylan Kerr says his players don’t need any motivation to play for the safety of jobs. Lidoda Duvha have five Absa Premiership matches remaining to save their top flight status and the Englishman insists they cannot afford any more slip-ups. The Venda-based side face another mammoth task when they tackle title chasers Bidvest Wits at Milpark’s Bidvest Stadium tonight (7.30pm). The PSL rookies have never beaten the Clever Boys this season – they lost 4-3 on penalties in the Nedbank Cup last 16 round and 1-0 in the league in December. They are sitting in 12th position on 26 points – five points ahead of bottom club Maritzburg United. On the other hand, Wits are desperate for points in their bid to narrow the six points gap between them and leaders Orlando Pirates. The Clever Boys have collected 44 points with four games to play, but they have a game in hand compared to Bucs. Said Kerr: “Since I arrived here (in November) the team has improved a lot. We are taking each game individually and it doesn’t matter whom we play because our future depends on the results. But we’ve got to ensure that we go to Wits with confidence. We played them three times with one game being abandoned, and we know what is at stake.” Kerr revealed that their 1-1 draw with Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in a league match a fort night ago is a big motivation for tonight’s match having lost 2-0 to log leaders Orlando Pirates. He went on: “We matched Chiefs pound for pound and I thought we should have won that game. We expect the players to apply the same mentality and score goals. This will be my first time at Milpark after a long time and I am looking forward to the match. Our preparations have been excellent and how we do on the night is purely down to players now.” Leopards will rely heavily on PSL top goal scorer Mwape Musonda to end Wits dominance, while Gavin Hunt’s charges will pin their hopes on striker Gift Motupa who has scored nine goals so far.
