MOKGADI Moseri believes make-up is an art and that everyone deserves to be beautiful. The 29-year-old woman from Thogoaneng Village, outside Polokwane, Limpopo, is a well-known beauty therapist in her village. She lives and breathes make-up. She started doing makeup in 2011 and has never looked back. The owner of Mokgadi Facebeat Studio, she wants to share some of her skills with other women. Mokgadi does not want to be separated from her passion. “I offer services such as skincare and personal makeup. I travel to places in the province and elsewhere to assist other women and I connect with my clients emotionally and physically.” Mokgadi also hosts workshops at which she talks to women about health, beauty and fashion. “I also teach women about foundation application, colour matching, highlight contouring, eyebrow blending and more. “Most importantly, I teach them how to apply make-up like a pro,” she says. Her dream is to own a beauty salon. “I want to see myself working with celebrities, meeting new people, travelling the world and becoming a famous make-up artist.”
