RESIDENTS of Caleb Motshabi, Mangaung, are happy their kasi is getting sewerage pipes. But they are also sad as trenches are swallowing up their people. A young man was found dead in a trench on Friday. He was the second person to die in less than a week after falling into a man-made drain. Mbulelo Qwesha (25) was the first victim on 6 April. Mbulelo’s mum Susan (48) said: “I’m very sad about what happened to my son. I was a little relieved when the construction started.” On Friday, a young boy was found dead in another trench. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, firefighters were trying establish how deep the trench was. A construction worker from Edwin Construction said the trenches were more than 3m deep. “We are installing sewerage pipes for toilets. But I’m not happy with the way the trenches are left open,” said the worker. “We have to listen to our bosses in order to keep our jobs. But people are dying and tThe bosses don’t give us warning signs informing residents that the trenches are dangerous. I guess they only care about money.” Edwin Construction manager Thobekile Chababala phone rang unanswered and she did not respond to Daily Sun’s phone calls and text messages. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the two deaths and said Kagisanong police had opened inquest dockets. Hlubi said: “In the other incident, the victim is estimated to be 15 years old.”
