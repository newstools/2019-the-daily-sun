 For the past twelve years the festival had themes and this
year it is no different as they themed this year’s festival is the Freedom
Charter because it is a base of why we are here and why is it important to
express yourself. Hip-hop is known as a genre where artists are able to
express themselves and building up to the main concert that is happening
tomorrow at Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown they had workshops to educate
young people about the Freedom Charter and how artist can exercise their
freedom by teaching themselves the base of being an artist and how to grow the
brand. Being one of the first hip-hop festivals that paved a way
for others founder of the festival Osmic Menoe said this year’s theme is the
Freedom Charter because of they got to understand the knowledge of the
country’s painful past has impacted the current generation. Watch Osmic explain in depth how they came up with the theme
and what to hip-hop lovers can expect at this year’s Back To The City as it
