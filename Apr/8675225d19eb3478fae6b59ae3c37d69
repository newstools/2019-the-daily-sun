THIS family of four from Amatikwe in Inanda, north of Durban have to stand all night when it rains because their roof leaks. They say they applied for an RDP in 2010 but they are still waiting. Family member Nkululeko Mthethwa (27) said: “We always pray that rain doesn’t come because for us it means we have to be on our feet holding buckets. “We don’t know if we will ever have a proper house to call home as we have waited for so many years. This life is not suitable for any human being but we have no choice because have nowhere to go,” said Nkululeko. He said no one is employed in the family and that they don’t have money to build a proper house. “My mother is old and gets piece jobs here and there. I’ve tried to look for job with no luck as I don’t have any qualification,” said Nkululeko. Nkululeko’s mother Thembisile (57) said she applied for an RDP many years ago. “I have lost all hope. I don’t know what to do anymore,” said Thembisile. KZN Human Settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said they will contact the family to check which housing project they registered for.
