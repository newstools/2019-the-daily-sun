DOES Zodwa go to the gym to keep fit? “No! I just do what I love, which is dancing,” she said. She’s known for her sexy moves, but there’s a lot more to the famous dancer and entertainer. Zodwa, whose real name is Zodwa Libram, told Daily Sun she doesn’t want her 13-year-old son to struggle like she did as a child. She said she lost her mum when she was 11 and was raised by her gogo and aunt. She’s never met her father. The 34-year-old media personality said she moved from her family home in Dlamini, Soweto, at the age of 16. “I moved from one place to another, trying to survive. I lived with cousins and friends,” she said. “I moved to Durban, where I found a job as a debt collector. I didn’t know anyone. “I’d go to shisa nyamas to have some fun using the little money I made from my job.” She said she’d dance and people would take videos and post them on the net. Then people started asking her to come and dance for them at their night spots. “I was in demand and realised I could make a career out of this,” she said. The dancer said her childhood gave her a don’t-care attitude. “If I cared what other people said I wouldn’t be where I am today.” Zodwa said she won’t stop hustling. “As long as you’re not killing anyone or doing crime, go for what you want,” she said “What people think about you mustn’t worry you.” “I’m not yet where I want to be. I want to leave a legacy. “I want people to be inspired when they think of me. “People should expect to see my reality TV show soon.”
