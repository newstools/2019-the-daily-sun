BOUYED by the favourable PSL DC outcome, Mamelodi Sundowns recorded a massive 2-1 win over Black Leopards in their Absa Premiership match at Thohoyandou Stadium on Tuesday. Second-half goals from Gaston Sirino and Tebogo Langerman ensured the Tshwane giants move to 53 points, three adrift of log leaders Orlando Pirates with two matches left this season. Tumelo Khutlang grabbed a late consolation goal for Leopards, but it wasn’t enough to ensure them a point they badly need in their fight to starve off relegation. But there was no stopping Sundowns after the League slapped them with a fine and not points deduction for illegally fielding Wayne Arendse against Bidvest Wits in October. “It’s not in our hands. It’s in Pirates’ hands. But I have to commend my players,” said Mosimane afterwards. “These boys are unbelievable, if you look at the programme we have. From Rabat to Thohoyandou. Excuse me! “It’s really humbling. What a programme we have. We even have to rest players of the return Champions League semifinal match against Wydad Casablanca.”
