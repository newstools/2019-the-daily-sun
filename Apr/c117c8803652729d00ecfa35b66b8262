THE quest to secure a Caf Champions League final spot is nearly fulfilled for Mamelodi Sundowns. At least that is how the Brazilians should be feeling after Caf acceded to their request to change the time for their keenly-awaited semifinal second-leg tie against Wydad Casablanca. The return match was initially scheduled for 6pm on Saturday (4 May), but will now be played at 3pm, at Lucas Moripe Stadium. Sundowns argued that the 3pm kick off satisfies all the Caf criteria rather than 6pm. This is good news for Sundowns as they will play under favourable weather conditions. They narrowly lost 2-1 to Wydad in Rabat on Friday. But forget about the lukewarm clash at Prince Moulay Adbellah Stadium. A feisty battle is on the cards when the two rivals renew hostilities on Saturday. With an all-important away goal, Mosimane’s side deserves to remain favourites to win the semifinal tie, though that assertion is open to debate. Mosimane left Morocco on Friday feeling proud of the maturity of his players, whose temperaments did not drop even when Wydad were at their most intimidatingly fluent for the better parts of the first leg. Anele Ngcongca hadn’t scored for Sundowns since he joined three seasons ago. But on Friday, the former Bafana Bafana defender scored one of the most important goals of his career when headed in from Hlompho Kekana’s effort. The goal was not only significant for the fact that it was the first for Downs against Wydad away from home. But the away goal is always crucial in this competition. “While I’m not entirely happy with the result because we lost‚ I’m happy with the performance because it’s always a difficult place for us in Morocco,” said Mosimane. “We must improve though. We made a lot of mistakes at the back. But we scored the important away goal.”
