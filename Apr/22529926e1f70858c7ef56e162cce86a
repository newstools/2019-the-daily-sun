THE number of road accidents in KZN over the Easter weekend has decreased. This was announced by Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande in Durban yesterday. Nzimande was at Mariannhill toll plaza at the close of the holiday. He said he was happy that the road accidents had decreased as this meant the number of deaths were reduced. Nzimande said some motorists were still caught drunk driving. But he said the number of unroadworthy vehicles remained his biggest worry. More than 700 vehicles were pulled aside in less than two hours during the road block and 70 of them were not roadworthy. “This is the biggest concern for us because we can’t have vehicles which could kill people on our roads. Most of those vehicle were public transport and carrying people,” said Nzimande. “We are planning on introducing a point system to ensure that motorists comply with road rules.” One of the passengers in a taxi travelling from Umzimkhulu to Durban said: “I think this is a good initiative. “If this was done every day more people would be safe on the road.” Driver Nkosinathi Bhengu (43) said he was transporting churchgoers from Estcourt to Durban in a bus. “I am happy that they did this operation because we are just hired to drive and don’t know if the buses are roadworthy or not.”
