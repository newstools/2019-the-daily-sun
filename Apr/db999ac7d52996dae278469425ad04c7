SHE is a jack of all trades – a radio and TV personality, MC, model – and an actress, which means the sultry star rakes in some serious moola. In an industry obsessed with material possessions and glamour, it’s so easy to squander all that money, but Pearl insists that she is money smart. The Metro FM presenter says she is savvy with her money and mostly invests in property. Speaking to Sun Buzz, Pearl said she is frugal with her money, which is why she was able to put down a huge amount of deposit for her latest property. Said Pearl: “I have not experienced any financial hassles, because I'm big on saving, so I had a huge deposit for the house that I bought recently – it was just a lot of admin and quite costly, but worth every cent”. She advised her peers to save for that proverbial rainy day. “This industry is fickle and sometimes there no jobs, so it’s important to save and invest in something that will have returns, like property, because it doesn’t depreciate, but it appreciates,” she said.
