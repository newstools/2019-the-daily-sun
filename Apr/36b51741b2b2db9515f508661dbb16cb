KGOTSO Moleko's late goal helped Kaizer Chiefs hold Golden Arrows to a 1-1 draw in a one sided Absa Premiership match played at FNB Stadium tonight. Amakhosi fans had already given up hope they will ever score when Moleko headed home George Maluleka's corner  in the 77th minutes to give them something to cheer about having braved the cold weather to rally behind them.  The tough defender cancelled Nduduzo Sibiya's 33rd minute lead via a curling shot against the run of play following a back-hill pass from Sanele Mathenjwa . Chiefs dominated the game but the crossbar was their main stumbling block to deny striker Bernard Parker, Philani Zulu and Daniel Cardoso the winner. Amakhosi remain in seventh position on 38 points with three games to play, while Arrows are still in ninth position on 33 points. Chiefs came into the match with their heads held high having beaten Chippa United 4-2 in the Nedbank Cup semi-final played in Port Elizabeth at the weekend. They were hoping to avenge the 2-1 defeat in the first round and give their fans joy  as it was their last home game of the season at the venue having failed to keep up with title chasers. Amakhosi coach Ernst Middendorp made six changes to the side that beat Chippa  as he preferred Daniel Akpeyi in goal ahead of Bruce Bvuma,  while Reeve Frosler, Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya , Philani Zulu, Dumisani Zuma and Hendrick Ekstein got the nod. But the notable absentee in the team was striker Khama Billiat who was not in the 18-man squad as he was involved in a car accident on Sunday. On the other hand, Arrows were eager to restore their pride following a humiliating 3-1 defeat to National First Division side TS Galaxy in the other Ke Yona Cup last four match. Abafana Bes'thende coach Steve Komphela made four changes to his starting line-up with midfielder Danny Phiri replacing Danny Venter, Sanele Mathenjwa was preferred in place of Lerato Lamola with Nduduzo Sibiya and Siboniso Conco also getting a run.
