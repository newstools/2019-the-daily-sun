widespread corruption scandal, the Johannesburg Sunday Times reports. The South
Africa Revenue Service (SARS) has concluded preliminary investigations that may
lead to charges of under-declared income, overstated expenses and other
misrepresentations against members of the ANC, Sunday Times said. Those on the
SARS list, the newspaper reported, include: Dudu Myeni,
the chairperson of ousted president Jacob Zuma’s charitable foundation Minister of
Environmental Affairs Nomvula Mokonyane Former

Zuma’s rule that the company paid R300 000 a month to the former leader’s
charitable foundation in return for protection from prosecution. SOURCE:
