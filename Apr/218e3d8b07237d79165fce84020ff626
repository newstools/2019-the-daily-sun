MANY promises to restore the dilapidated building in Brandfort, Free State where Winnie Mandela spent years under house arrest have been made. In September, Arts and Culture deputy minister Maggie Sotyu promised something would be done before the election on 8 May. Daily Sun published the story on 27 September, but nothing came of the promise. But Minister Nathi Mthetwa visited the area yesterday to introduce the contractor appointed and provide updates. While waiting for him to arrive, about 20 DA members held a silent protest in front of Winnie’s house while community works programme workers were busy cleaning the yard. The DA’s George Michalakis said: “Government only visited the place when the DA made a noise.” Mthetwa said there were many iconic buildings in memory of politicians. “We are on the mission to form a heritage landscape in the country. We are here to fast track the process so Mama Winnie’s dignity is restored,” he said. He promised the project will start on 2 May and finish on 4 November. “It will cost R2,9 million.” He introduced Beckie Maseko and Nico Motshwane from Kopano Construction, who will handle the project.
