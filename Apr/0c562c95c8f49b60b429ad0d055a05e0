Isibaya actress, Ayanda Borotho shares how she was left frustrated and angry recently after experiencing bad service at a juice bar after gym. She detailed the ordeal, explaining that the Black waitress delivered the smoothie to the white customer and when her order was ready she was called to come fetch it! In the video, the actress asked if she was maybe overreacting? "Please tell me if I'm overreacting but the way this person engaged me as a 'paying' customer was disgusting. Lapho udadewethu(sister). Black like me.” "When I asked her why she did that she said  'sorry', and gave me the 'you think you are better' look. Sometimes my own people can just suck the life out of you. But we still support black and buy black because the vision is bigger than the shallowness we encounter," she wrote of her experience. Ayanda, however, treated them with kindness, "I tipped them double this time. That's how you deal with small minds," she said. Please tell me if I'm over reacting but the way this person engaged me as a "paying" customer was disgusting. Lapho udadewethu. Black like me. When I asked her why she did that she said " sorry " and gave me the "you think you are better look." Sometimes my own people can just suck the life out of you... (but we still support black and buy black because the vision is bigger than the shallowness we encounter). And so I tipped them double this time. That's how you deal with small minds. ?????? #UnbecomingToBecome #UnlearningTheLies #TakingOffTheCoats #IamEnough #ConvosWithAyoungMe #LiveButDontLeaveYourselfBehind #Eve #SikulentoYeWovement A post shared by  Ayanda Borotho (@ayandaborotho) on Apr 22, 2019 at 1:32am PDT
