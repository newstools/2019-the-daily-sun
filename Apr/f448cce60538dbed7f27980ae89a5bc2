A NIGERIAN prisoner awaiting trial for alleged child stealing has died after giving birth to twins. The death of the woman in Calabar has led to a fight between prison authorities and the media. Some media claimed the twins were delivered inside the prison. “The media reports are not true,” said Effanga Etim, public relations officer at the prison. He said the woman had a Caesarean section but died from complications. Nigeria has one of the world’s worst maternal death rates. – CAJ NEWS
