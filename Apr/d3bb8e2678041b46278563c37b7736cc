PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa met the girls who rescued him from becoming road kill! Ramaphosa met Aaliyah Baker (10) and Fatima Cassiem (10) from Greenside Primary School in Joburg yesterday. This came after a video of the girls coming to Ramaphosa’s rescue went viral on Twitter. In the video, Aaliyah and Fatima are seen standing on the side of Beyers Naude Drive. They explain they were in a car when they saw an ANC election poster on the road. “We are not going to allow anyone to drive over our president, so we are going to pick it up,” they say in the video. They then wait for traffic to clear before running to pick up the poster. Fatima’s father, Nusrah Cassiem posted the video on his company’s Twitter page. After the video went viral, ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula asked the girls to meet Ramaphosa. “You are the future of the ANC. We can’t wait for you to grow a little older and help us lead the nation,” he said. Ramaphosa said it was an honour for him to meet the girls. When Ramaphosa asked the girls what they wanted him to do as president, they said they wanted him to ensure there were clean toilets at schools, everyone had shelter and that the government acted against pollution. They scored an invitation to the presidential inauguration next month.
