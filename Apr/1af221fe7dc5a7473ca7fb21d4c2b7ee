EVENT promoters Tebogo Manthi and Ndu Mogapi want their money back from Cassper Nyovest. This was after the famous rapper didn’t arrive for his performance. The award-winning rapper was booked to perform at the Golden Score Party at The Stone Complex in Mahikeng, North West, last Saturday. But he didn’t arrive and told organisers he had a family emergency. Speaking to Daily Sun, Tebogo said they booked and secured Cassper’s performance by paying him a deposit for the amount he requested in January. “When we started the talks we agreed he would perform at 12am. He then asked to perform at 10pm because he had a performance in Joburg. He arrived at the agreed time, but didn’t get out of the car. His driver told us Cassper had a family emergency he had to attend to,” he said. Tebogo claimed Cassper switched off his phone and blocked their numbers. He said they only wanted the money they’d paid him and an apology. “We normally host big events and this has ruined our image. We must pay for expenses,” he said. Cassper’s manager Lerato “T-Lee” Moiloa denied the claims. “Those are lies, but carry on and write the story to sell the paper and save your job,” he said.
