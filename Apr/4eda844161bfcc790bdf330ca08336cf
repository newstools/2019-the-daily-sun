SMALL chicken farmers are battling to stay in business. This is due to the rise of chicken being imported from Brazil. The South African Poultry Association has raised concerns about claims by a consumer protection body and a new organisation called the Emerging Black Importers and Exporters of SA. The Association of Meat Importers and Exporters fully supports trade from Brazil at the cost of workers in the chicken industry. The Poultry Association represents hundreds of chicken farmers, big and small. As such, we have seen first-hand the devastation that uncontrolled dumping over the past few years has affected emerging black farmers. In the last six months, it has watched almost half the small farmers go out of business as a result of the markets being flooded with increasing volumes of dumped chicken. The hundreds of workers these farmers employed have now joined the ranks of the unemployed. Imports, 61% of which come from Brazil, currently outnumber the output of the biggest South African producer. Import tariffs have not slowed this down either. Brazil is said to have increased its exports to fill up the gap left by the avian flu in the European Union. The Poultry Association is pushing for an 82% tariff payable by Brazil, the maximum set by the World Trade Organisation. Ebiesa also claims that it needs to import at dumped prices to be able to export to other countries. Would it not make more South African sense to support the drive, as SAPA has been doing, that would enable more local producers to export proudly South African chicken to the rest of the world? .
