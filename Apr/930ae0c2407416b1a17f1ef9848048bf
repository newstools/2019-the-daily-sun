A 14-year-old girl has died, and nine others are fighting
for their lives in hospital. This is after a collision involving five cars on the N3
south near Inchanga in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday night. According to the Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst,
paramedics responded to the scene just after 8pm. Herbst said paramedics assessed the scene and found that a
14-year-old female passenger sustained fatal injuries and was declared dead on
the scene. He said another nine patients sustained injuries ranging
from minor to moderate. The girl was thrown out from the vehicle on impact. She was
a passenger in the Fiat Uno seen in photographs tweeted by Netcare 911. “All the patients were treated on scene and once stabilised
were transported by various ambulance services to hospital for further
treatment,” said Herbst.
