RELEGATION-TROUBLED Chippa United should not expect any favours from Polokwane City That is a stern warning from Polokwane City coach Jozef Vukusic ahead of the teams’ Absa Premiership clash at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The Chilli Boys are in danger of being relegated since they are second bottom on 24 points with two games to play. They are a point ahead of basement side Maritzburg United. On the other hand, City have already cemented a top eight spot. But the Serbian mentor wants his charges to finish the season as high as possible. To ensure they achieve their target, Vukusic said he will field a strong team tomorrow to end the season with a win at home. “This is our last match at home and we want to win it for our fans,” Vukusic said. “We know they are fighting to stay in the PSL, but we want to please our fans and finish on a high note.” Defeat for the Chilli Boys and a win for Black Leopards, together with Free State Stars, could mean Chippa will have to fight for promotional play-off spot with bottom side Maritzburg. But a win will boost Chippa’s hopes of avoiding the axe hovering above their heads. Leopards and Stars are only two points above them. Chippa are coming to this clash with three consecutive league defeat. They lost to Bidvest Wits, Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City. Chippa coach Clinton Larsen will rely on former Orlando Pirates duo Mark Mayambela and Thabo Rakhale, while Vukusic will bank on his captain Jabu Maluleke and Edgar Manaka.
