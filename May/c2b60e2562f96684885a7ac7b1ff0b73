MIRIAM
Sithole has been struggling to sleep ever since a company she claims she paid
to erect tombstones for her family failed to do so. Miriam (30) is The
30-year-old from block GG in Soshanguve, Tshwane. She said she was scared her
ancestors would be angry with her. “I believe the three dead family
members are un happy with the delay. I’m worried I will die badly because of
their anger,” she said. Miriam said the issue was
dividing her family. “This is hurting me and I’m
fighting with my family now,” she said. She said her relatives believed
she’d stolen the money meant for the tombstones of her brother Lucas Bopape,
her father, also Lucas Bopape, who had the same name, and her gogo
Maria Mopape. She said it had made her scared
to see her family as everyone contributed to the cost. “We’ve cancelled
the tombstone ceremony twice. We cancelled the first one in August last year
and the second one this year in February.” She claimed to have paid R18 800
to Tombstone Cutters in Hammanskraal last year for the tombstones. “They are sending me from pillar
to post. I don’t know what to do and are not responding to my calls,” she
told Daily Sun. Miriam said she paid R18 800 to
Tombstone Cutters in Hammanskraal last year to produce the tombstones for her
brother Lucas Bopape, her father, also Lucas Bopape, who had the same name, and
her gogo Maria Mopape. She said she wanted nothing but a
refund from Tombstone Cutters as they had failed to deliver. The owner of Tombstone Cutters
promised to comment later when he was contacted on Friday. But the SunTeam was not able to
get hold of him before going to print.
