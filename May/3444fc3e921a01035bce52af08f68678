A GROUP of 20 farmers were smiling from ear to ear on Wednesday. This was after they received three trucks and three bakkies from Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala. The farmers were from the King Cetshwayo Municipality, northern KZN. Zikalala said the donations were to help them deliver their crops and livestock to the market. Beneficiary Phumzile Ntuli said they were grateful that government came through to help their businesses grow. “We have a dream of changing our lives and we encourage others to do the same because there is help out there,” said Ntuli. She said they wanted to encourage other farmers to continue working hard because farming was life. Zikalala said it warmed his heart to see that residents in the area still had a deep passion for farming. “We promise to give them continued support, together with traditional leaders and ward councillors, because we want to see change in the next six months.” Zikalala said their wish was to see ordinary residents turning themselves into successful business people. He said they wanted the farmers to show people it was better to be self employed than an employee.
