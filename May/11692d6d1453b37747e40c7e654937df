CITY of Joburg officials listened attentively as Yeoville’s gogos and madalas complained about thugs who make their lives unbearable. They said they’re being robbed and intimidated, often by people they claimed are undocumented foreigners. Speaking at the meeting on Sunday, Councillor Vasco da Gama pleaded with cops and Metro police to patrol the area. Busisiwe Nkosi from the municipality’s social development department assured the elderly that they’re a priority. She said the department has a programme to help them with counselling and finding affordable retirement homes. Superintendent Dan Machete urged residents to give Metro police tip-offs. Municipal spokeswoman Chantelle Fourie blamed evil slumlords and property hijackers. “Illegal churches and taverns are mushrooming and causing noise pollution in the Yeoville area,” she told the People’s Paper. Fourie said drugs continue to be a problem.
