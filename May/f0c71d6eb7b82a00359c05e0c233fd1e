ANTI-APARTHEID activist and former Eastern Cape MEC Thobile Mhlahlo died on Friday after a short illness. Mhlahlo, who held various positions in the provincial government, died at St George’s Hospital in Port Elizabeth. Provincial ANC spokesman Gift Ngqondi told Daily Sun: “This is a moment of great pain, grief and sadness for the Mhlahlo family and for all of us in the movement.” He said Mhlahlo will be remembered as a humble and dedicated activist who commanded respect and was sincere. “He was an activist who really cared about the people that he served and the country in general. “Mhlahlo was indeed a brave and daring cadre of the ANC, loyal and uncompromising on matters of principle and organisational discipline. “He’s one of those struggle heroes whose contribution to our freedom makes it almost impossible for us to speak of the history of struggle without singling them out for special mention. “We lower our banners for this loyal leader.”
