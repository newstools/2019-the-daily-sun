Facebook wants to help you hook up with your friends. A year after the US social networking giant announcedÂ Facebook Dating, a tool for finding potential dates, it has now announced "Secret Crush" - a new feature for figuring out which of your friends might be open to romantic overtures. The announcement comes as Facebook attempts to move past two years of scandals and crises, from Cambridge Analytica's misappropriation of tens of millions of users' data to the social network's role in spreading hate speech that fuelled genocide in Myanmar. That wall is now coming down - just slightly. "Secret Crush" lets users of Facebook Dating select nine of their Facebook friends who they "want to express interest in." If the admired friend also uses Facebook Dating, and has also selected that person back, then they'll be notified that they're each others' crushes; if not, nothing happens, and they're none the wiser.
