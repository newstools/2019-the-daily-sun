MEMBERS of a village peace committee have welcomed the arrest of a man who allegedly terrorised them. Cops bust the suspect in Gauteng on Sunday. He allegedly killed four people in Egunjini in Msinga, KZN Midlands, last Sunday and two in January. The people killed recently, after being accused of committing evil deeds, were related to peace committee members. A committee member told the People’s Paper: “We’re happy he’s now behind bars. “We’re praying he stays in prison for a long time.” Another member said the suspect had caused villagers a lot of pain. “After the killings we were living in fear,” he said. “We even moved our families to keep them safe.” The man said that after hearing the suspect had been arrested, he fetched his wife and kids from their hideout. But he was worried the suspect could have had accomplices. “We urge the police to continue with their investigations,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the suspect was bust in Gauteng. Zwane said the suspect will appear in court soon in connection with murder cases.
