IF everything goes according to plan, Mzansi people will no
longer be able to access porn sites. The South African Law Reform Commission (SALRC) has
published a discussion paper on sexual offences in South African, in the hunt to
evaluate the laws surrounding access to porn and how exposure to children affects
them. The SALRC wants all devices in the country to have a default
setting that will block pornographic material, unless the user provides proof of
age. “The discussion paper has six chapters. Chapter one provides
an overview of the investigation and includes reference to the legislative
developments in a number of government departments in South Africa. “Chapter two focuses on the access to or exposure of a child
to pornography (legal adult sexual material). Chapter three looks at the phenomenon of children creating
and distributing self-generated sexual material (commonly),” the SALRC said. The commission also wants a clause forcing communication
service providers and financial institutions to report such offences. “The Commission
provisionally recommends the inclusion of an obligation to report the
commission of offences pertaining to child sexual abuse material or exposure of
children to pornography,” the commission said.
