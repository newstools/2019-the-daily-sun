FORMER president Jacob Zuma has threatened to reveal the names of senior ANC leaders plotting against him if his corruption trial goes ahead. Zuma was speaking to his supporters outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Friday. About 500 people carried posters reading: “Zuma come back and lead the poor” and “Hands off Zuma”. Among those supporting him were former ministers Mosebenzi Zwane and Des van Rooyen. Zuma said he had warned the ANC about the dirt that would come out of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture tainting leaders other than himself. “People thought the commission would say Zuma has done this or that, but former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi hasn’t mentioned my name,” said Zuma. Advocate Muzi Sikhakhane, who is acting for Zuma, tried to introduce a letter believed to be about a meeting allegedly held between former president Thabo Mbeki, former NPA head Bulelani Ngcuka and former justice minister Penuel Maduna. Zuma and French arms company Thales had applied for their prosecution to be permanently stayed. After a week of argument, the judges reserved judgment. They are expected to deliver their verdict within three months.
