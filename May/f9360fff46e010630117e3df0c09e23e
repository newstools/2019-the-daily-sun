MOST people in rural areas would like to have tarred roads. But residents of Kgabalatsane in North West and Ga-Rankuwa View in Gauteng said all they wanted was to go back to having a gravel road between their two kasis! They said the tarred road was extremely busy as it led to an industrial area. Instead of ensuring a free flow of traffic, the road was a nightmare for motorists and pedestrians as it was full of potholes. They said it was common to see cars with punctures being fixed along the road. The SunTeam that visited the area found that a trip that should take 20 minutes on the road took more than an hour. The team came across motorist Maboki Baloyi, who had just had a puncture. “When it rains, tractors are called to help pull cars out of trenches. But it is the quickest way to the industrial area and we are forced to use it,” he said. Milo Moatshe (42), the owner of a takeaway business along the road, said he was losing customers daily. He said he was also tired of helping motorists. “I’m a cook, not a mechanic. But most of the time I change tyres and help to push cars because many of the motorists are women. “We have tried to get help. But some officials says the road is the responsibility of the North West provincial government, while others say it falls under Gauteng. We don’t even know where to go any more,” he said. Madibeng municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala confirmed there was a dispute over who was responsible for the road. He said the bad sewerage system at the Ga-Rankuwa View RDP settlement had contributed to the damage.
