THESE women wait next to the road in Birchleigh, Ekurhuleni, hoping to be picked up. And no, they’re not magoshas. It makes them angry that men mistake them for prostitutes. Sarah Mlambo said: “Men want to use us for a few minutes’ pleasure. We’re here for piece jobs. “We’re dignified people looking for piece jobs to support our families. If we were sex workers, we’d be wearing skimpy clothes.” Forget Dube said jobs are scare, and that’s why they often come to Birchleigh. “You’re lucky if you get piece jobs twice in a week.” Jeanette Ndou said: “We often come here hoping to be picked up for piece jobs such as doing the laundry or cleaning houses. “Sometimes you’re picked up once in a month or not at all. “It’s not easy but we have no choice but to be here.” Chantelle Mguguruza said she was inspired by two friends who used to stand near the road. “They finally landed jobs. Today they’re able to support their families,” she said. Jonathan Ndebele comes with his wife. “I’ll kill a man who tries to pick up my wife for sex,” Jonathan told Daily Sun. “I often take the person’s cellphone number and the registration number of the car before they leave with my wife.”
