THE IEC’s deputy chief electoral officer Masego Shiburi said the IEC is ready for the election. He was speaking at the National Results Operations Centre in Tshwane yesterday. He said the first votes were cast by overseas citizens on Saturday. And 774 094 people are due to cast special votes on Monday and Tuesday. On 8 May, voting stations will be open from 7am to 9pm to allow the country’s 26,7 million voters to have their say. “Voting stations will be staffed by about 189 000 election volunteer officials who’ve been trained over the past two months,” he said. Yesterday Police Minister Bheki Cele told the media that police have been hard at work putting security measures in place to protect voters. He said they had identified the North West and KZN as high-risk areas. “Five teams will be maintained at national level to be sent to any part of the country where the situation requires urgent intervention.” He said the cops, Home Affairs, the IEC, the Demarcation Board, the justice department and the State Security Agency were working together to make sure the election was safe. “All areas will be accessible for all citizens to exercise their constitutional right to vote,” he said.
