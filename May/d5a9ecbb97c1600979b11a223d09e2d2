FED up parents at Mcheni Primary School have demanded that pupils be moved from unsafe shacks and mud huts to temporary structures. The school in Tsolo was built by parents in the 1980s and had 242 pupils. On Tuesday, about 30 parents visited the Eastern Cape education department’s offices. Sakhumzi Batshobonke said the department promised to provide temporary structures in 2017 while they built new ones. “Our children are in danger at that school. Classrooms are collapsing and roofs are leaking,” said Sakhumzi. Parent Sisanda Rabulana said when it rains pupils don’t go to school, and when it’s hot they can’t focus in class. Even the shacks we built as temporary relief from the mud structures are old and rundown. “There isn’t even water, and pupils have to relieve themselves in the bushes,” she said. The parents said they hoped things would change when a contractor built foundations last year, but then everything suddenly stopped. They said the situation showed that government didn’t care about their children. SGB secretary Noliso Sange said they couldn’t take their children to other schools. “The kids are very young and they’d have to cross rivers to get there,” she said. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said he couldn’t comment on the matter as there was a court case pending.
