 BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic's off-the-field problems continue to
escalate due to financial difficulties ­­– and now goalkeeper Patrick
Tignyemb's contract has been terminated. The veteran Cameroon international, who has served Celtic
with distinction since 2008, was said to be demanding unpaid bonuses from the
club. However, his demands lead to the termination of his contract
on Tuesday morning. A reliable source told SunSport on Tuesday morning that
senior player Tignyemb has been shown the exit door by the club. When contacted to confirm if he was fired or not the veteran
goalkeeper refused to make any comments, Tignyemb asked to be contacted after
20 minutes. He did not answer back. Celtic players once again boycotted training last week
because members of staff had not been paid their salaries for quite some time. It was not the first that training had been disrupted by a
strike as the Siwelele camp has been rife with financial problems owing to the
situation of club boss Max Tshabalala. However, on Monday the club issued a letter that was seen by
SunSport to the players. The letter stated that players must report to training the
following day (Tuesday) if they fail to do so drastic actions will be taken
with regards players absenteeism. The letter reads: We hereby like to inform you that if you do not attend
the training session tomorrow (Tuesday)at 09h00 at Dr Molemela Stadium as per
your program, you will be defying your contract that you have signed with the
club and that is a serious offence. Should you not report the club will be forced to take
drastic actions with regards your absenteeism One of the major actions the club may take are as
followings not limited to: You are hereby instructed to attend the training
session tomorrow (Tuesday)and respect your individual contract. Please double check your contracts and read it
thoroughly as the perpetuated report with the bonuses is misleading you
