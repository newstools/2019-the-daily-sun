A SHACK fire claimed the lives of four family members at Town Two in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, yesterday. Twayisa Myathaza (36) and her kids Nandile (14), Lindokuhle and Linamandla (5) died. Former councillor Ryder Mkhutswana, one of the first people on the scene, said: “It’s devastating that the whole family died in the fire. People suspect an electricity box exploded. “A sound was apparently heard before the fire, but the family didn’t know what was happening. “It was too late for the family by the time they realised the house was on fire. But one person survived after he managed to jump out the window.” Resident Thandiswa Mguyu said the community was worried that another fire might break out. Neighbours said the man who survived the fire, Thobela Makhungo (41), is Twayisa’s brother. Relative Neliswa Magwala said the family needed help to bury their loved ones. “The mum was unemployed. She survived on the kids’ grants.” Cops had not responded to Daily Sun’s questions at the time of going to print.
