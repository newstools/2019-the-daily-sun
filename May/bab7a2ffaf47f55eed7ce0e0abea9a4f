WHEN DIKELEDI slipped from a rock and fell into the water, moruti Noah didn’t hesitate. Without any thought for his own safety, he raced into the dark  water. BUT TO SAVE THE GIRL’S LIFE THE MORUTI SACRIFICED HIS OWN. It was a selfless act from a man of God. WHEN shocked members of the Sambulo Christian Church of Zion from Duduza, Ekurhuleni pulled moruti Noah Mondlane from the water on Sunday, it was too late! Dikeledi Ndungwane (15), who lost her footing when she was going to be baptised, said the incident had left her with deep scars. “I feel guilty that moruti died saving me. I wish I could erase the memories from my mind,” she cried. “I thought I was going to die. The current was strong and I was drowning.” Dikeledi said she was standing when her feet slipped and she sank into the river. “I raised my hand for help. The mfundisi who was holding me was also going down but he managed to swim to safety. “I asked God to save my life,” she said. At that moment, Noah jumped into the water. Paulina Mondlane (59) said when her husband pulled the girl to safety he slipped back into the water. “Members who could swim dived in and pulled him out. He was covered in mud,” said his wife. “We pushed on his chest many times. We even breathed into his nose but he just lay there quietly. I knew it was over.” She said she’s struggling to come to terms with her husband’s death. “In the morning when I wake up I look at his photograph and I have to remind myself to ask him if he’s indeed gone for good. “I miss him. He was my only friend. He died the way he lived,” she said. Church members said they had been going to the river in Nigel to baptise for years and had never experienced anything like this before. The girl’s gogo, Kate Ndungwane (60), said they are relieved that Dikeledi was saved. “But to lose someone who was very close to us is hard to accept,” she said.
