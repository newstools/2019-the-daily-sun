THE presidential inauguration will apparently cost a lot less than the inauguration of 2014. Five years ago the inauguration cost R240 million. Minister in the Presidency, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in Tshwane yesterday the inauguration is scheduled to take place at Loftus Versfeld Stadium, Tshwane on 25 May. She said the event will cost only R120 million. “We are aware of the economic difficulties facing the country so we decided to cut the cost,” she said. The event will cost less at the stadium than it would have at the Union Buildings. “Until you have the event you can’t tell exactly how much it will cost.” The inauguration will see president-elect Cyril Ramaphosa being sworn in by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. Dlamini-Zuma said another reason they opted for the stadium was to make the event more accessible to more people. “With this set-up everyone will be together, which is important for us,” she said. Government has also limited invitations to heads of state in line with costcutting measures.
