STEVE Hofmeyr fans started braaing their DStv decoders last week. This came after the Afrikaans singer promised he would give R10 000 to fans who destroyed their decoders and satellite dishes. MultiChoice announced the company would no longer broadcast any content featuring Hofmeyr. Last month, it threatened to withdraw its sponsorship of the Ghoema Music Awards if Hofmeyr’s song, Die Land, was not removed from the list of nominees. Last week, Hofmeyr shared a video on Facebook of himself driving over his decoder and throwing his dish off his roof. He promised a R10 000 reward to anyone who did the same before 1 June and posted a video on Facebook. “Yes, you can’t boycott everything and everyone but I’m going to try. I’m done with MultiChoice and all their channels, including Kyknet and Showmax,” he said. Although some fans did what Hofmeyr asked, many social media users said it was stupid. Desire Pretorius joked on Facebook that she would destroy her decoder and buy a new one after getting the R10 000. Lerato Masilela said she did not understand the drama. “They could just have unsubscribed. What they are doing is only destroying their own property,” she wrote.
