THEY don’t call it the ultimate human race for nothing! The Comrades Marathon is one of the toughest races in the world. Andthousands of runners are expected to gather in KZN for the 94th edition. The eagerly-awaited 87km Up-run will start at the Durban City Hall at 5.30am and finish at the Scottsville Racecourse in Pietermaritzburg on 9 June. The Nedbank Running Club are eyeing the highest place on the podium in the men’s and women’s races. Known as the dream team, they are going all the way this year. Last year, Bongmusa Mthembu ofArthur Ford and Ann Ashworth ofMassmart walked away with the biggest accolades in the Down-run. But long distance sensation Camille Herron of the US is back to defend her Up-run title she won in 2017. Gerda Steyn, Herron’s running mate, is tipped to become the first South African lady to cross the finish line. Mthembu, who is Kwa-Zulu Natal’s favourites son and back-to-back champion, is still the runner to beat in the men’scategory. Nedbank’s running club manager Nick Bester is also banking on Limpopo’sveteran Ludwick Mamabolo, with eight Comrades appearances under his belt. Bester’s team has a host of local and international runners and he believes his team will complete the double this year. He said: “We’ve assembled a formidable team and they are ready to make us proud. Camille is back to defend her title and she is in good shape. Our chances of winning the race in the men’s and women’s race look good.” Said Bester: knows how tough the marathon is as a former winner himself, but he believes that his team can pull it off. “The big name athletes will arrive five days before the big race and we expect them to take charge.” Mthembu is set to make history when he complete a hat trick of podiumvictories in front of his home town fans. He won the 56km Two Oceansmarathon in the Mother City this Easter.
