PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) chairman Irvin Khoza has gain reiterated that the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa’s (ICASA’s) proposed regulations would destroy professional soccer in Mzansi. The public hearings into ICASA’s Draft Sports Broadcasting Services Amendment Regulations (2018) entered the third today and the PSL brought heavyweights Khoza, Kaizer Motaung and Peter Mancer to present to the panel in Irene, Pretoria. The (PSL) is listed under Category B of the draft regulations, meaning all the exclusive rights that SuperSport hold would be stripped and handed to the public broadcaster, the SABC. Khoza has said that this would cost the PSL 80% of its revenue. “Nobody wants public access to the PSL content more than the PSL itself,” Khoza said. “The broadcasters are the delivery agent and they would not be interested if we did not have superior content. And just because it is popular does not mean you can give it away for free in the name of access. “Funding models are a critical part of any business. To be subjected to a blatant attack to our tried and tested funding model threatens our very existence as a stable and competitive league that does not depend on any state funding.” Khoza also warned that the regulations would destroy the sport and cause famine to those who depend on sports to make a living. “These draft regulations, if enacted [into law], will destroy the high quality contest that the PSL is trying to put out,” he warned. “It will destroy clubs and render footballers jobless. It would have a major knock-on effect on the game and the tens of thousands of South Africans who depend on football to make a living. “We want to be like the EPL, La Liga and we want the [Lionel] Messis to come and play in South Africa.”
