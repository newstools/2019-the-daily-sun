STUART Baxter has shut the door on Bafana Bafana wildcards! Peripherals hoping to squeeze into the Africa Cup of Nations squad had better not hold their breath. This automatically rules out experienced, yet forgotten internationals such as Andile Jali, Kermit Erasmus and Itumeleng Khune, the latter who was hoping to make a late push for a place. Keagan Dolly’s place is also not secured, the injury-prone winger having to prove fitness. Baxter has overseen a radical change in the make-up of his squad, dropping a host of experienced campaigners in favour of younger faces such as Lebo Mothiba and Teboho Mokoena. He is now also considering bringing Denmark-based Liam Jordan and Joel Untersee, who plays in Switzerland. “I don’t think there’s any real need to go back to the players that are outside the system,” said Baxter. “Going back would be a sign that we haven’t got a clue of what we are doing. I don’t know what that will do to South Africans, quite honestly. “And I’m not necessarily talking about Andile (Jali). I know Andile can keep the ball. I know Tokelo Rantie is a great striker on his day. A lot of players that haven’t featured recently are not bad players. “But I don’t think the principle of jumping backward and forward lends itself to any coherent vision for the future. I don’t think I’ll be doing South Africa a service by doing that.” However, Baxter is not overly concerned about Darren Keet, who has lost his grip on the number one jersey at Bidvest Wits. Keet hasn’t played in the last four league matches, amid talk he is stalling on a new deal. “If he was a centre-back or striker I’d say I’m concerned. Everything the goalkeeper goes through, he does it in training. The sharpness is there,” Baxter added.
