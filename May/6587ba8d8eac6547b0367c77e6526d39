SEEING a homeless mum living under a bridge with her two children touched Freda Malema. The 56-year-old mum of two is now trying to help the homeless. Freda, from Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane, runs a project called “Drop a Blanket”. She collects blankets and distributes them to the needy. She said she could not help the mum under the bridge, but seeing her situation made her reach out to others. “I posted on Facebook about what I’d seen. I asked my friends to drop a blanket off at various places in my kasi. The response was phenomenal.” She said they first collected 40 blankets, which she gave to homeless people in Marabastad. “When we were giving away the blankets, the number increased as the homeless people called each other.” Freda hands over blankets twice a year to three orphanages in the area. She’ll host the Mr and Miss Drop a Blanket pageant at Morula Resort in Mabopane on 25 May. The competition is open to kids aged between 8 and 12. .
