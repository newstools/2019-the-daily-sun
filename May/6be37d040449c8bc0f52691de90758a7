You don’t want to get on Black Coffee’s bad books, the DJ is the king of clap backs! A follower tweeted that Black Coffee is always posting about himself, the places he visits, and does nothing to assist with the challenges the country faces as a prominent DJ! “I love your music and admire your success but every time you tweet its all about you and places u go. No word about challenges we face here, like now in KZN EC or encouraging youth to go vote etc… its all about you. Have a nice time in Angola” the tweet said. This follows the international DJ’s selfie that he posted, which he captioned “Its Angola tonight”. Black Coffee didn’t take the comment lightly, he responded with a major clap back! And showing that he has actually donated R100 000 to the Umlazi disaster and with Afrotainement, Gagasi FM and Kings of the weekend, they have raised R370K! He then asked the fan what does he have to say for himself! Black Coffee is not one to brag about what he does and it is true, just because it is not on social media, it does not mean it not happening!
