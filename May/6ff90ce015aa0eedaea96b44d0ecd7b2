AARON Malaka has always been passionate about recycling and now he’s sharing his passion with other people. The 43-year-old from Brakpan in Ekurhuleni said the idea came to him in 2007. He said recyclers come to his place once a week to learn about recycling and he provides the training for mahala. Aaron said years ago nobody paid attention to the accumulation of waste in homes and landfills. There are many reasons why he started his recycling school. “Recycling helps us to convert our old stuff into new useful products which is good for the environment. “We are saving resources and sending less rubbish to landfills, which helps to reduce air and water pollution,” said Aaron. He said some plastic bottles are not rubbish. “Keep them out of the waste stream by recycling them. “Check for local NGOs, schools and shopping centres that offer recycling to take your rubbish.” Aaron said he wants to see people taking recycling seriously. Muzi Mokoni (32) told Daily Sun Aaron is not just a teacher but a true environmentalist. “His work to provide helpful information about our environment is inspiring. “I’ve learned a lot from him and I will pass the information on to others,”
