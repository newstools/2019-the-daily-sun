THE workers often mined sand from an open quarry with no safety gear. But their luck ran out on Tuesday afternoon when soil fell on top of four construction workers in Lebowakgomo, Limpopo, burying them alive. Two of the victims died at the scene, while the others are in the ICU at Lebowakgomo Hospital, fighting for their lives. They apparently started digging sand for construction and were loading it into a truck when a riverbank collapsed on them. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the police search and rescue team was sent to the scene, but two people, aged 34 and 39, were already dead. “The survivors suffered serious injuries. We wish them a speedy recovery,” he said. Ngoepe said the two dead men were Zimbabwean and could not be identified until their families were informed. “The truck used to deliver the sand was released to the owner because it was not the cause of the accident. Our investigations are still continuing,” he said.
