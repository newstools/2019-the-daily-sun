IT’S all systems go for the ABC Motsepe League play-offs with the scene set for a pulsating battle for a spot in the National First Division (NFD) for next season. That is despite the pending cases of four provinces – Limpopo, Gauteng, Eastern Cape and North West – due to outstanding cases of alleged corruption. The play-offs will take place in Cape Town from 4-9 June where winners of each provincial division, which comprise 16 teams, will battle it out for the two available spots in the NFD next season. The draw was conducted by Safa and the ABC Motsepe Foundation at Safa House, Joburg yesterday to determine the three groups and fixtures that will be played over a week-long period. The nine teams will play each other once, and the three teams who finish top of their respective groups will advance to the semi-finals, alongside the best runner-up. In addition to earning a spot in the NFD, the ultimate winners will also receive a cool R1 million, while the runners up will walk away with R500 000. Speaking at the draw yesterday, Safa president Danny Jordaan said the Motsepe League has played a crucial role in ensuring teams have an equal chance of moving up the ranks, and eventually PSL. PSL teams like Baroka FC, Chippa United and Highlands Park all started in the ABC Motsepe League.
