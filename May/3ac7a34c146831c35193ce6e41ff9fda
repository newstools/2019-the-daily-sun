IN JULY last year, Sigqibo Pheza madea decision that changed his life forever. The 30-year-old stopped taking his medication for schizophrenia, a mental illness, and it ended up costing him his legs. He told Daily Sun just days after stopping the medication, he started hearing voices and seeing people in black clothes walking towards him. He said he started thinking people were planning to kill him. “The voices I heard were saying they would chop me into pieces,” he said. Sigqibo said one morning, he went for a walk in the park near his home in Arcadia, Tshwane, when he saw a car crash. The voices told him he was meant to die in the accident. “I ran back to my flat and jumped from the ninth floor,” he said. Sigqibo miraculously survived but his legs had to be amputated. “The doctors said I could get artificial legs and I will be able to walk normally with them. “I approached a government organisation that gives people artificial legs, but the waiting list has a backlog of two to three years,” he said. Sigqibo said he was worried if he didn’t get legs soon, he would become depressed and try to kill himself again. “I’m pleading with anyone who may be able to help me to please do so. The cheapest artificial legs I found through a private company cost R100 000,” he said. “I desperately need help so I can live a normal life again.”
