CLIVE Noconjo is a man on a mission. The father of two takes time after work to teach kids karate in Mbizana. Clive is the provincial secretary of IKO Matsushima Africa. “For me this is a way of life. It’s not a painful thing to do,” he said. Clive told Daily Sun that karate helps him stay focused. “The relationship between me and karate, especially kyokushin, is very strong. That’s where I learnt the importance of discipline. “We do every step of training together and the children are happy to be here,” said Clive, who works for the local municipality. Clive said that kyokushin is all about discipline, commitment and good behaviour. He said that he enjoyed working with kids. “The aim is to prepare these children to be good citizens in future. They train every day after school. The kids are committed and take the training very seriously,” Clive told the People’s Paper. He said he also trains adults and encourages his students to stay away from trouble. “I have seen the lives of young and old people turn around because of what we do here. “Karate helps people build self-esteem and confidence.” Clive is proud that the number of people who come to his training sessions has grown. Siyamthanda Mvaxa (13) said she enjoyed karate. “I gained confidence. Now I am in the right space mentally because karate keeps me focused. It has also taught me discipline and commitment,” said Siyamthanda, who used to play netball before joining Clive’s gym.
