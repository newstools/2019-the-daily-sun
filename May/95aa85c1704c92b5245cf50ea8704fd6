The Sharks were denied at the death by a converted Crusaders try in injury time as Super Rugby's top-of-the-table clash ended in a draw in Christchurch on Friday. The match finished 21-21 after the Sharks had led 9-7 at half-time. Sharks flyhalf Curwin landed seven penalties for the visitors, while the nine-time tournament champion Crusaders replied with three tries by hooker Codie Taylor, centre Jack Goodhue and flyhalf Mitch Hunt. Hunt added all three conversions, the final of which clinched the stalemate. Both sides picked up two points for the draw and remained atop their respective conferences.
