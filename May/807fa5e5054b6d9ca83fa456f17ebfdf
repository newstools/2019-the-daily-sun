Media personality and entrepreneur, Bonang 'Queen B' Matheba recently introduced her brand new Brut and brut Rose MCC’s called House Of BNG and already the star's bubbly range is already over-achieving just like it's creator. WATCH: BONANG DROPS CHAMPAGNE BRAND #HouseOfBNG Queen B's bubbly range will be the supplier of champagne at the prestigious event that is expected to draw the who's who of Mzansi's politics. Queen B will be all smiles at President Cyril Ramaphosa's inauguration this Saturday at Loftus stadium in Tshwane. The 31 year-old posted the great news on her social media: "The @houseofbng is proud bubbly supplier for the 2019 Presidential Inauguration on May 25th 2019!! Congratulations to President-Elect Cyril Ramaphosa! We can't wait to toast you", she tweeted. This is a big move for the new kid on the 'bubbly block' as international bubbly brands are usually favoured for ANC celebrations. Bonang was one of the celebrities who received a videocall from Ramaphosa on election day three weeks ago, where she helped to encourage the people of Mzansi to go out and vote. In the videocall, she had promised to send the president a bottle of her popular bubbly. This is #blackgirlmagic at it's best!

We can’t wait to toast with you..???????? pic.twitter.com/WfoLtWsKEQ
