BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis has bowed down to pressure and included Nompumelelo “Mpumi” Nyandeni in her squad as standby player for the Fifa World Cup in France. The veteran midfielder was initially not part of the 21 players earmarked for the tournament, despite her experiences. SunSport has reliably learnt that the 31-year-old was recently called up to travel with the squad to France on standby alongside Ongeziwe Ndlangisa and Jessica Williams. The world showpiece is scheduled for 7 June to 7 July. When asked about her about-turn, Ellis referred all enquiries to Safa spokesman Dominic Chimhavi. And Chimhavi was clear that Nyandeni could only get action in France when a player gets injured. He went on: “There are three players travelling with the team to France. But they are not in the playing squad unless something happens. The standby players will always be there (at the World Cup) and Nyandeni is among the three (when the squad was announced).” But Chimhavi could not reveal if the three players will be paid or not if they are not drafted in the squad.“I don’t know (if they will be paid). What I know is that they are travelling to France with the team,” he said. Nyandeni made her Banyana debut in 2002 against Zambia and has participated in seven Africa Women’s Cup of Nations, where she scored 38 goals. A reliable source told SunSport that senior players had revolted against Nyandeni’s snub, especially with 149 caps to her experience. “The players told the coach she can’t drop Mpumi for inexperienced players with two caps,” said the source.
