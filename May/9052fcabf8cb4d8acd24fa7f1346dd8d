Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middensdorp has likened their Nedbank Cup final defeat at the hands of minnows TS Galaxy, to a bad dream. Amakhosi ended their woeful season with a shocking 1-0 defeat to the National First Division (NFD) newcomers in the final played at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday. The defeat ensured that the Glamour Boys would end another season without silverware, extending their four yearlong trophy drought. Middendorp was lost for words after the match, having just witnessed arguably the biggest upset in the history of the competition. “This is definitely something you can’t believe, you think you are in a dream,” Middendorp told SuperSport TV after the match. “But congratulations to TS Galaxy. It was a bit better in the second half, we pressurised and had a good entrance into the final third but it’s the same story, same thing that has been happening for the last six, seven months, we are not finalising our movements. "If you are not finalising your moves then you are likely to end up like this."
