PHAKHAMANI Mahlambi’s international has been thrown into serious doubt. This is after he was kicked out of the Bafana Bafana Cosafa Cup squad today due to ill-discipline. It is alleged the Mamelodi Sundowns attacker reported for camp drunk on Sunday, though Safa were yet to confirm. Cape Town City midfielder Gift Links has since been called up as a replacement. Bafana coach David Notoane would not confirm the developments, but he is believed to be hugely disappointed by Mahlambi’s actions. Stuart Baxter would be disappointed, too, given that Mahlambi is one of the players he was eyeing for the Africa Cup of Nations.
