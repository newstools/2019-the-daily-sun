MELAKUDE Gumede’s family believe he was killed by evil taxi drivers who set hitmen on him. The taxi rank boss from Camperdown, north of Durban, was shot and killed while walking out of his yard on Wednesday. He was apparently on his way to the Pietermaritzburg Taxi Rank, where he worked, when a white BMW drove towards him and a man fired several shots. Melakude’s brother Mthembiseni (41) told Daily Sun they were still in shock. Mthembiseni said some taxi drivers didn’t like Melakude – he didn’t take nonsense. “My brother didn’t want drivers who don’t have permits,” he said. “So taxi owners and drivers who don’t have permits hated him.” Mthembiseni said he, too, was shot at several times in 2016 by unknown gunmen who were looking for his brother. “Luckily I survived. We’re hurt by this incident. My brother worked at the rank for 14 years. He respected and loved his job. He didn’t take nonsense.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated by Camperdown cops. “A 33-year-old man was allegedly walking out of his yard when he was approached by unknown suspects who fired shots at him,” said Mbele. She said the victim sustained gunshot wounds to the head and back and  was declared dead at the scene.
