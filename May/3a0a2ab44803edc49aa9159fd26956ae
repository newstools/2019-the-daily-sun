Pro-Makhado task team deputy chairman Arnold Mulaudzi has been granted R5 000 bail and the shutdown of Vuwani in Limpopo has been suspended. His case was postponed to 3 June. He was arrested on Tuesday night and charged with intimidation, incitement of violence and contravening electoral processes. Villagers at Vyeboom, near Vuwani, where Mulaudzi lives, clashed with police on Wednesday, demanding his release. There is still a high police presence in the area. Takalani Mukhudi, chairman ofthe Pro-Makhado task team, said they decided to suspend the shutdown immediately once Mulaudzi was released. “We have a lawyer who will represent him in court,” he said. Residents from other villages in Vuwani managed to cast their votes.
