MAMELODI Sundowns are bracing themselves for another legal battle with the PSL over the protracted Wayne Arendse saga. This is after the League lodged an appeal with the Safa Appeals Board (arbitration) against the sanctions meted out to Sundowns for fielding an ineligible player.Sundowns were two weeks ago found guilty by the PSL disciplinary committee (DC) for fielding Arendse, who was ineligible in their Absa Premiership fixture against Bidvest Wits in October and were fined of R250 000.The PSL are yet to confirm whether they were pursuing the arbitration route.However, in a document seen by SunSport, they are arguing that the monetary fine is not commensurate with the offence and are therefore seeking relief.They want the appeal to be upheld and sanction of awarding the match to Wits with a 3-0 goal advantage, instead of the R250 000.“We will fight this and put a strong case just as we did during the initial hearing,” said Sundowns acting general manager Yogesh Singh. “Our legal team is ready. We’ve received the notice to appeal and we are busy preparing our papers. We will fight to protect our right. “We believe the judgment issued by the DC was a very well-written and we will defend that judgment. Obviously, this matter has to be treated as urgent because the last game is on Saturday. “As Sundowns, we don’t want to be treated better than any other team, but we want to be treated fairly.” Singh added they need certainty on the matter before the Premiership gets wrapped up with the last round of fixtures on Saturday. Sundowns are back on top of the standings with 56 points – two ahead of closest rivals Orlando Pirates in a neck-and-neck title race. The Brazilians need victory away to Free State Stars at Goble Park to defend their title. Bucs have to beat Polokwane City and hope Downs slip up, for them to emerge victorious.
