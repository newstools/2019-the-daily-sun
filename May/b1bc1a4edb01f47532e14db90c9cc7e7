MANTE Mampuru has been voting since the first democratic election. She told Daily Sun although she was very disappointed in the government for leaving her house to rot, she will still exercise her democratic right. The 46-year-old mother of three from Matebeleng, in Ga-Sekhukhune, Limpopo, said her roof was leaking and there were holes throughout the house. She moved into the RDP in 2006 and almost immediately, cracks appeared in the walls. A few weeks later, the toilet caved in completely. And the roof is also on the verge of falling in. Mante said she kept reporting the matter to the councillor and the municipality but nothing was done. “We were promised the house would be fixed but it’s falling apart. We have nowhere else to live,” she said. Mante said it was very difficult in winter and when it rains. “Water fills the house and we are forced to put blankets on the ground to prevent it from flooding. My seven-year-old daughter is always sick,” she said. Mante said although they could use buckets to catch the water, they couldn’t stop the wind. She is unemployed and her family survive on social grants. She pleaded with SunLanders to help her find a job or to help her build a new two-roomed house. “I need to protect my children from the weather because my youngest is always sick,” she said. Representatives of the Fetakgomo Tubatse Municipality were not available for comment.
