RADIO host, actor and singer Bongani “Smeva” Mabaso presents his online radio show every Sunday from 3pm to 6pm. Smeva won the SA Upcoming Musicians Awards HD Radio presenter, and went into radio hosting this year. But he said TV presenting has always been his first love and he’s ready for it. He told SunBuzz: “I came up with the idea of the show I host and also with the weekly content. The idea was actually for a TV show. “I’m ready to go into TV, because my show will help people. “I want to do a show for people with a spiritual calling, like sangomas and traditional healers. “It will teach people about issues like religion and traditional healing.” The presenter who has played a DJ on SABC3 soapie, Isidingo, said: “My show supports all things traditional. I play maskandi and mbaqanga and make sure to play music from up-and-coming artists so people get to know them. “We also tackle issues that build us as Africans.” Smeva said he wanted big media companies to give young black people a chance. “If there’s one thing I’ve learnt on my journey with radio, it’s that Africans are creatives and can put together beautiful content. But people will only see the talent if we are given a chance. “That’s why I want to open my own production company so I can help young people with potential to build big things,” Smeva said.
