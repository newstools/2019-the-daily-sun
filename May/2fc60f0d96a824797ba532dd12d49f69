THREE suspects have been arrested already, but families of the two murdered Metro cops have unanswered questions. Constable Sonto Mhlanga (37) from Mpumalanga and Sergeant Fanifani Dladla from Tongaat were shot dead outside the home of Councillor Sthembiso Zulu in Inanda, north of Durban. The deadly shooting happened on Monday. The two had been providing security at the councillor’s home for the past 10 months. Dladla’s daughter Sindi (38) told Daily Sun: “It was not part of his job description. The eThekwini Municipality hasn’t explained to us why they turned my dad into a security guard.” She said municipal officials had still not visited her or her mum. Asked for comment, Mhlanga’s brother Thulebona Mathebula said he couldn’t talk as he was at the mortuary. He said he’d comment later. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said: “The cops were tasked with providing security after a threat was discovered. “Combatting crime is part of their job. The municipality thought it necessary to protect the councillor, and we sent law enforcers where their services were required.” KZN Hawks spokesman Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said three suspects have been arrested. “Police are still gathering information,” he said. “But we can confirm that three suspects were arrested in KwaMashu M section yesterday.” Mhlongo said two of the suspects were in custody and the third was under police guard in hospital. The man was shot on the day of the murder.
