THE City of Joburg is clamping down on inner city crime. Member of the mayoral committee for public safety Michael Sun launched an intelligence operations centre reaction unit yesterday. The centre is to be the city’s nerve centre for fighting crime. Operators monitor 480 cameras around the Joburg CBD from the Metro cops’ Martindale offices. Sun said the introduction of the unit would ensure that reaction times for crimes went down. He said the Metro cops will have more muscle with the launch of the new unit. “We are looking at a reaction time of three minutes for incidents,” he said.  Sun said they identified hot spots in Hillbrow, Yeoville, Doorfontein, the inner city and Braamfontein, where smash and grabs and muggings are a problem. “Units will be sent to the hot pots in unmarked cars and civilian clothes, but there’ll also be some marked cars for the sake of police visibility. This will allow us to react quickly.” Sun encouraged the units to use their tools of the trade. “I am asking you to go out there and ensure our residents are protected. “These muggings on the street must be a thing of the past,” said Sun. The operations centre is set for an upgrade. Richard Witte, director at the centre, said they were in the process of upgrading from analog to digital systems.
