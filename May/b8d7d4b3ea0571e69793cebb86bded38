Pop Star Icon Rihanna launched a multi-hyphenate and luxury French fashion giant LVMH and we take a quick look at  luxury label's Instagram page. The inception of the FENTY luxury label is a historic moment for the Fashion culture as it's been over 30 years since an original fashion house was created at the luxury goods company LVMH. “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” she said according to WWD. “Mr. [Bernard] Arnault [chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH] has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.” FENTY.com A post shared by  FE?TY (@fenty) on May 20, 2019 at 6:55am PDT
