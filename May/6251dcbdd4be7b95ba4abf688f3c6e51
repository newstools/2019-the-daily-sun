Gone are the days when women wait for the man to propose, they take matters into their own hands. Zodwa Wabantu went down on one knee over the weekend to propose to her ben 10 and he said yes!  The love birds have been together for more than four years and they are ready to tie the knot. Zodwa shared on social media she will wait for no man to proppose to her.  “We as Women we give our Men Money to Marry us. Hard working Women hide that they Marry themselves by giving their Boyfriends money to go to their families to pay Lobola.” She also mentioned that she is not desperate to have a ring on her finger.  “Some Women get Desperate to have that Ring on their Fingers But I don't mind showing reality cause everything that has to do with Zodwa Wabantu is real. Mine is Real, I will Marry him.”  Zodwa has made it clear that this is the man of her dreams! With recent comments about her weight gain, she let us on a secret, that “sex and happiness make a woman fat”, no wonder she plans on spending the rest of her life with her Ben 10. We as Women we give our Men Money to Marry us. Hard working Women hide that they Marry themselves by giving their Boyfriends money to go to their families to pay Lobola. Some Women get Desperate to have that Ring on their Fingers?? But I don't mind showing reality cause everything that has to do with Zodwa Wabantu is real. Mine is Real,i will Marry him.
