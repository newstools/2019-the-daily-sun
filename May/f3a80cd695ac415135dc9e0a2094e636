AFTER being released on parole in 2017, this 45-year-old vowed never to return to jail. The man from Protea Glen in Soweto, shared his life of crime with Daily Sun. He was first bust at the age of 14 and again at 17. When last arrested, he was 30 and was sentenced to 43 years in prison. He ended up spending 13 years at Westville Prison in Durban. He went into crime because he saw gangsters driving expensive cars and dating beautiful women. “I saw my teachers were poor. But now I see crime doesn’t pay.” He started with petty crime and graduated to robbing businesses. He said when he was 17, his parents kicked him out. He ended up moving from one area to another. “I gave neighbours money so they wouldn’t snitch to the cops.” He said he used to target white people. “We hijacked their cars. We shot those who hesitated in the knees, as our rule was not to kill.” They used to rob petrol stations but he was finally bust in a cash-in-transit heist. “My wake-up call was my girlfriend coming all the way from Joburg to visit me. I pray not to go back to that life. I look forward to make an honest living.”
