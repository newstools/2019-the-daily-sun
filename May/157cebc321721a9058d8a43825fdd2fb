HE’s eight years old and doesn’t qualify to vote, but he already wants to talk to President Cyril Ramaphosa. Sello Lebese, who lives in an RDP in Mamelodi East in Tshwane, wrote a letter to the president. “I want to advise him on how to make people happy,” said Sello. “I won’t tell you how because I want to tell him in person.” Sello, a grade 2 pupil at Sediba Sa Thuto Primary School in Mamelodi East, told Daily Sun he wants the president to visit him. “I can give him tips on how other children can love him like I do.” Sello said he wants to discuss the condition of his kasi. He said when it rains he struggles to walk to school with his friends as there are no pavements. Last week Sello was campaigning with his friends, carrying an ANC poster. He wants to be a cop so he can arrest criminals. He said President Ramaphosa is the right man to lead Mzansi. His dad Andrew Lebese (48) said Sello started talking about the ANC when he was five. “We’re surprised he even went to the streets to demonstrate his love,” said Andrew. Mum Julia Lebese (46) said: “We want the president to build us a beautiful house and to fix our roads.”
