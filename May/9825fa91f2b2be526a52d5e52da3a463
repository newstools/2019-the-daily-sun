Oprah Winfrey has splurged on a wedding dress for one of her former students from the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy in South Africa. The young lady, who goes by @glori_r on Instagram, is set to walk down the aisle soon, and in order to do so had to find the perfect dress. That's where Oprah came in. According to reports, the former talk show host shut down Saks Bevery Hills bridal store in California, spending $10 000 (R142 800 at current exchange rate) on the dress. Sharing a picture of the happy bride-to-be on social media, Oprah wrote: "I've known these girls since they were 12 and 13 coming to my school. Graduating from college. Grad school. Now our first wedding. Looking for the perfect dress." I’ve known these girls since they were 12 and 13 coming to my school. Graduating from college. Grad school. Now our first wedding.
