SIMON Mahlangu (44) and his family are looking for his lost nephew Bongani Kutumele (29), who disappeared two weeks ago. Simon said Bongani was last seen dropping off his girlfriend in Thembalethu Village in his VW Golf. At the time he was with two friends. Simon from Tweefontein, KwaMhlanga, said they heard that after dropping off one of the two friends, Bongani drove to the other friend’s place. He told Daily Sun they’ve asked everyone including relatives about Bongani’s whereabouts, but no one had seen him. “We’re having sleepless nights. We’ve tried almost everything to find Bongani, but with no success,” he said. “We even went to his girlfriend’s place, but she had not seen him. “We’ve visited hospitals and mortuaries but we couldn’t find him. “We even went to the police station, thinking he might have been arrested, but there was still no sign of Bongani.” Simon said his nephew is not the kind of person who’d just disappear or go somewhere without telling anyone. Sergeant Nomthandazo Shabalala said a missing person’s case has been opened. A nyone with information should call 079 891 5057 or Simon on 072 270 3966.
