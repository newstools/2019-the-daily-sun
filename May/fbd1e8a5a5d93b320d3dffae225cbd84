A GRADE 6 pupil (11) was allegedly badly beaten by his teacher in Mpumalanga last Wednesday. But apparently he was not the only one. A parent claimed half the class was beaten because they submitted work late. The parent said her traumatised son told her about the incident when she came back from work. “My son said he had been badly beaten by his teacher and his bum was sore. “I didn’t realise how bad it was until he took off his trousers,” she said. “He said the teacher beat them because they submitted their school work late.” The mother said she did not mind kids being disciplined, but the teacher was taking his frustrations out on children. She said the teacher apologised, but the parents were not satisfied because he had done it before. Education spokesman Gerald Sambo said: “The department has already instituted an investigation into the alleged assault of a pupil. The department will do everything possible to get to the bottom of the matter.” He said they will organise counselling for affected pupils.
