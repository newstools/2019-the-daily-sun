Actor Oros Mmpofu is about to grace our everyday screens again and this time on the popular ETV soapie, Rhythm City. Oros revealed that he will start appearing on Rhythm City from the 16th of May as the character of a young Eastern Cape-born Banele on his Instagram post. According to a statement released by etv:"Banele’s story is that of trials and tribulations. He is the first person in his family to go to university and that becomes both a great privilege and a massive responsibility as his family heavily relies on him for help. Being the sole breadwinner is no glitz and glam and Banele quickly finds himself working as a recycler in order to send money back home."
