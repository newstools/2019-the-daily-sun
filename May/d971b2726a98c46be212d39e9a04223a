THESE two friends put poor pupils first. Letlhogonolo Moalusi (22) and Andrise Mojela (26) use their Open Door events company in Alexandra, east of Joburg, to make life easier for kids in the North West rural areas. Letlhogonolo said they organise the Help a Child Walk event every year to raise money for school materials. “We target poor kids who’ve been identified by principals of rural schools,” he said. He came up with the idea after he saw the work of Alex Music Festival organiser Bheki Mahlangu, who donates wheelchairs to kids in his kasi every year. “I love donating to the less fortunate. I’m from a poor family. “I struggled to go to school, and seeing a child with an old uniform and torn shoes brings tears to my eyes. It reminds me of the pain I went through.” He told Daily Sun he was raised by his gogo after his parents abandoned him when he was a baby. He said the first school to benefit was Molelwane Primary School in his home town of Brits. They donated 52 pairs of school shoes and other items to the kids. Andrise said he joined forces with Letlhogonolo because he wanted to make a difference. “I was overwhelmed by the response to our first donation last year.” He said they would not only be making donations in North West. “We’re coming to Gauteng, where we’ve identified some primary schools.” Andrise said they wanted to see the project grow so they could help more children. “We also intend to donate pads to poor girls,” Andrise told the People’s Paper.
