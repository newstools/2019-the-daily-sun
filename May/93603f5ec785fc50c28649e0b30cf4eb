OVER 200 pupils from Tantseka Village in Mthatha have to relieve themselves in the open! A contractor allegedly locked their school toilets last month over outstanding payments from an agent the education department hired. Tantseka Primary principal Raymond Maxwebisa said pupils have to walk over 800 metres to relieve themselves. “Younger pupils sometimes relieve themselves in the school yard. “We have no control because it’s between the department and the contractor.” Maxwebisa said the contractor warned them at the beginning of the year that he would close the toilets. “We reported it to the department. He comes to the school to check if the toilets are still locked, but the department never sets foot here.” Teacher Weziwe Nogemane-Zozo said: “We have to wait for those who have gone to relieve themselves. Teaching has been disturbed as a result.” Contractor Jerry Sifanele of Siyaphambili Trading said although he couldn’t say exactly how much he was owed, he would only unlock the toilets when he was paid. Gwegwe, Xhwili and Julukuqu primary schools have also been affected. Sifanele said: “It’s been two years since I signed the completion certificate and have been waiting for my money”. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the contractor was paid what was due to him. “He has a contractual duty not to disturb the use of sanitation facilities. The department awaits legal action by implementing agent Mvula Trust, the contractor’s employer.” Trust spokesman Mohale Mashao said the contractor has been paid for work done. Mashao said they gave him another chance to check the final accounts and if he felt they were incorrect, to refer it for independent arbitration. “The only outstanding issue relates to the final accounts which were approved by public works in September 2018. The contractor refused to accept them and has been referred to the contract.” He said they’d start legal proceedings if pupils were still denied their rights.
