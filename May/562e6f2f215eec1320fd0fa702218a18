MARITZBURG United are not prepared to let go of their Absa Premiership status without a fight. They got their play-off campaign off to a good start after edging Royal Eagles 1-0 at the Harry Gwala Stadium yesterday The Team of Choice, who finished second from bottom in the league, received a lifeline when they sneaked into the play-offs on the final day of the season. They now have to battle National First Division (NFD) sides Eagles and Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila for the final spot in the top flight next season. Thabiso Kutumela’s solitary goal was enough to hand the Team of Choice the all-important three points in the KwaZulu Natal derby. Maritzburg started on the front foot, pinning their opponents back in the early stages. They launched wave after wave of attack but Eagles shot stopper Hugo Nyembe was equal to the task. Eagles’ resistance was finally broken in the 36th minute when Kutumela slotted in from a tight angle to put the home side into the lead. Eagles grew into the game in the second half as they went in search of the equaliser which would have seen them retain top spot in the play-offs. However, their efforts were thwarted by Maritzburg goalkeeper Richard Ofori. Maritzburg sit top of the standings, and next travel to Limpopo to take on TTM at Tohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday (3pm). Eagles will also make the same trip as they too face TTM in their next match at the same venue on Saturday (3pm).
