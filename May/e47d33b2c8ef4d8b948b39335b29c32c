THE mother of a three-year-old girl who was killed by dogs on Saturday could be arrested. The child was allegedly left alone in a room at a tavern in Mokopane, Limpopo. Her mum (33) was not with her. She apparently left the girl asleep on the bed. But the child later woke up and walked around the tavern yard, where she was attacked by dogs. The dogs were pulled off the child, but she died later in hospital. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the mum could be charged with child negligence. “Cops are still questioning the mother. ” When Daily Sun visited the family’s home, the child’s gogo refused to speak to the SunTeam. “Leave before you cause my family more pain,” said the gogo. When the SunTeam went to the tavern, the dogs were still in the back yard and the owner was not around. When the owner was called, she refused to comment. Social Development MEC Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana said: “I send my heartfelt condolences to the mother. But I condemn an incident that could have been avoided if the child was being looked after. “Children are not supposed to be taken to taverns.”
