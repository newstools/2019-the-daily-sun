IF YOU have a brain, you don’t have a disability. This is the belief of 49-year-old Sipho Ntuli from Ngwanase, northern KZN. He was still a child when he fell in love with traditional dance and song. When he was 12 spinal tuberculosis robbed him of dancing, but his love for art never died. He couldn’t go to school because it was far away. “I used to write poems and plays while other kids were at school,” said Sipho. “In 2000 I started a business making mats. I made grass mats and later started making grass baskets and artificial flowers.” But his passion for the performing arts pushed him to start an arts group in 2002. He coached people to play different roles in his plays. “Many people were interested in the group. We started performing at different schools. “But I later dissolved the group because some people were only interested in making money through us.” In 2010 he started a group for people living with disabilities. “We often perform at local events. “Our plays educate residents about people living with disabilities. Now we also perform at local festivals,” said Sipho.
