AFTER international artist Keyshia Cole tweeted in Zulu, Mzansi’s Black Twitter instantly decided she had been hacked! Keyshia received a tweet from a South African user and she amazed her Mzansi fans with her response! “Hi, everyone. Ngiyakuthanda! Ngiyabonga ngokungilandela,” she tweeted which means, I love you, and thank you all for following me. Some believed she was using Google Translate while others thought she was receiving help from a South African.  The many attempts supposedly sent by the Heavenly Sent and Trust hitmaker to convince Mzansi she wasn’t hacked didn’t make any difference. “I’m not hacked. I just know what’s up,” she said, while a fan tweeted: “Take a video saying those lines.” When a user asked her if she was sure she wasn’t hacked, she responded: “Yini esihogweni okhuluma ngayo,” which means what the hell are you talking about? Fans gave her African names. Khanyisile, Khanya and Mbalenhle were suggested. Some praised her for trying to speak Zulu and even offered her land!
