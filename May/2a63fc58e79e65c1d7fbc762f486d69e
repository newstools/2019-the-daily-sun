MOST hip hop videos are all about the glitz and glam of the industry. They’re often shot in clubs where artists pop champagne while surrounded by hot girls. In their quest to bring something different to the music scene, PEDI rap duo Jacky “Mopedy” Morema and Lopez “Slumkidd” Khumalo shot a video in a cemetery in Polokwane, Limpopo. The music video was for the track Don’t Trust Me. Some of their fans embraced their creativity while others said they had crossed the line. Despite some of the backlash, they said they were not going to let anything stop them from rising to the top. Mopedy told SunBuzz: “In the music video we wanted to move away from shooting in obvious places such as clubs, pubs and taverns with half naked vixens and champagne.” They said they wanted to introduce something different to the music industry and hoped it would help them make a mark. “It’s crucial to be creative so we can attract and entertain more supporters,” said Mopedy. He said their spooky video was a surprise to their fans as they never announced their plans to them. Slumkidd said: “This is something we always wanted to achieve. I have never had the perfect song to go with this kind of video.” He said he was thankful for the collaboration with Mopedy. “If I were to be asked to do it again I definitely would,” he said. The music video was directed by Slumkidd with Makobane “General Gubz” Mogashoa.
