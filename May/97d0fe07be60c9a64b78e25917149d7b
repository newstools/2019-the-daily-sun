 Black First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama arrived
in his home town of Tlokwe in the North West riding in a donkey cart to cast
his vote. Mngxitama says he is confident that his party will have
representation in Parliament and in the North West Legislature. He said this regardless of the Equality Court's ruling which
has ordered the party to remove its slogan 'Land Or Death'. In an interview with News24, Mngxitama said: "We just
need enough votes to have a voice in Parliament." Asked if he believes this could happen, he said:
"Miracles are known to happen". Despite the controversy that surrounds the party, he is
heartened by how people have responded to it. "People's response to us has been phenomenal, we've
definitely turned a corner. If you asked this six months ago I wouldn't be
sure, but now..." He said South Africans were amazing and showed the party a
lot of sympathy as they believed it was treated unfairly.
