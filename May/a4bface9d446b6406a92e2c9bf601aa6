YOUNG Lumka Mketwa was found in a pit toilet in Bizana, Eastern Cape, last year. Five years ago, Michael Komape also drowned in faeces in Limpopo. To prevent more young ones from drowning and dying like this, Domestos has set another big target for themselves. The sanitation company wants to raise money and start building new toilets in 20 schools this year. Last November, radio and TV presenter Anele Mdoda, set an ambitious goal to raise over R1 million to build new toilets in one school through a crowd-funding campaign, in partnership with the company. Through this partnership things are set to change for the better in many schools. Anele has just been named the company’s official sanitation brand ambassador. and today’s sod turning marks the start of their construction. “I’m proud and happy to see this project come to life. I never had any doubt that Mzansi would come through for us and make this a reality,” she said at the recent sod-turning ceremony. “I’ve been truly humbled by the enormous support from big and small corporate entities and everyday South Africans alike.” She said the 600 pupils, once the toilets are complete, will no longer have to suffer the daily indignity and danger of unsafe, unhygienic sanitation at school. The campaign received cash donations of over R130 000 from businesses and consumers, but the bulk of the donations came in kind from a handful of key investors including Norcros SA, Aveng Group, Ithemba Infrastructure Consulting, MMQSMace, Designdex who have donated materials and services towards the project Representing DesignDex, Paul Avelar led guests to view the sites where the new toilets blocks will be built. Mandisa Mbenenge of Unilever SA said the brand was proud to be part of the programme. “At Unilever, we believe that businesses have the power to drive influential social change.”Through this partnership things are set to change for better in many schools including Thembalethu Primary School
