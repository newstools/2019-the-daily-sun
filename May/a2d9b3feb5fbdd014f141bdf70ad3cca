 The new Renault Megane R.S. Trophy-R has just toppled the Honda
Civic Type R as the king of the Green Hell for front wheel drive production
cars. The Trophy-R is a hardcore version of Renaultâ€™s hardcore Megane
R.S. Trophy. It uses the same 1.8-litre turbocharged petrol engine found in the
normal Trophy. It achieved a record-breaking 7:40.1 (Type R: 7:43.8) at the ring
by going on a diet, maximum weight reduction (up to 130 kg compared to the
Megane R.S. Trophy excluding options). The Renault team also reworked aerodynamics and gave the R more
radical development of its drive axles. The new Megane R.S. Trophy-R will debut on the 24th of May 2019,
the Friday before the Formula 1 Grand Prix De Monaco.
