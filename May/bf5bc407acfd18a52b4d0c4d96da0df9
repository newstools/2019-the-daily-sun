PROTESTS over land in the Strand, Cape Town, have left many businesses looted and vandalised. But Yusuf Ahmad is one of the lucky shop owners who was protected by residents when his shop was about to be looted. The shop is in Greenfields, Lwandle. Yusuf said his neighbours stood in front of the shop with sticks and told the protesters they couldn’t loot. “Residents stood in front of the structure and prevented the protesters from coming close to my shop,” said Yusuf. He said although the protests have ended, he was still grateful to the residents for standing up for him. “There were hundreds of people and I was ready to open the shop to let them take whatever they wanted. Somali business owners are easy targets when there are service delivery protests. “What these residents did made me realise that there’s still humanity.” Noxolile Dyasi, one of the people who helped Yusuf, said people in the kasi did not approve of shops being robbed. “Criminals who pretend to be fighting for land will not succeed here. We saw what happened to other shops and knew it was coming to Yusuf’s shop. That’s why we took action,” she said. “What are we teaching our kids when we allow looting to happen?” Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said the municipality will buy land for the protesters. “We resolved to temporarily move over 700 families occupying land in servitude and power line areas to Sanral land in order for them to receive basic services like everyone else. “The City of Cape Town is buying the land for long-term development,” said Madikizela.
