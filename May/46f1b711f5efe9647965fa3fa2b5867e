LETUKA Mojake (49) will have 12 years behind bars to think about his crime. Mojake, from Moemaneng in Marquard, Free State was sentenced to 12 years in jail after being found guilty of rape, housebreaking and robbery by the Thaba Nchu Court on Tuesday. Free State NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said magistrate Magda Jacobs sentenced Mojake for offences he committed on 10 June 2012. According to the evidence, Mojake broke into the house of a woman who was six months pregnant at the time and raped her. He also robbed her of a hair trimmer, two hair clippers, a DVD player, TV, watch, her handbag and hair products. The total value of the stolen items was about R20 000. In court, the accused denied being guilty of the crime, even after he was identified by the complainant and the DNA results came back positive, linking him to the rape. Prosecutor Tshidi Sebolai presented a statement from the victim in which she said the incident had traumatised her and affected her financially. During sentencing , Jacobs said the court must send the message that these kinds of offences will not be tolerated. She sentenced Mojake to 10 years for rape and five years for housebreaking. Three of the years for housebreaking will run at the same time as the 10-year sentence for rape, making Mojakeâ€™s sentence 12 years in jail.
