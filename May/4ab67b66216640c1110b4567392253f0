EPHRAIM “Shakes” Mashaba is ready to return to the Premier Soccer League (PSL). According to an insider, Black Leopards management have offered the former Bafana Bafana coach a job in a bid to avoid fighting relegation again next season. Lidoda Duvha finished the 2018-19 season fourth bottom on 30 points from the same number of matches. The 68-year-old is expected to replace Englishman Dylan Kerr who is due to join DR Congo side AC Leopards having resigned from Lidoda Duvha last week. But that is pending his resignation being accepted by Leopards. Mashaba was in charge of relegated National First Division (NFD) side Witbank Spurs until he was axed. He was relieved of his duties with five games remaining after being in charge of nine matches where he recorded two wins, three draws and four defeats. Said the source: “Leopards are interested in Mashaba’s services and have already made inquiries about his availability. The management reckons he will be able to instill discipline in the team, something that lacked under Kerr’s guidance.” However, Mashaba revealed that Leopards have yet to approach him: “I know nothing about it, they haven’t spoken to me. But I will coach the club if approached. I am available to coach in the PSL and I have no problem.” Mashaba joined Spurs in January after being in charge of Bafana from 2014 until 2016 when he was sacked for bringing the South African Football Association (Safa) into disrepute. He led Bafana to the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Equatorial Guinea where they got booted out in the first round having lost to Algeria, Ghana and drew with Senegal. His roller-coaster ride continued with failure to qualify for the 2017 Afcon finals, finishing third behind Mauritania in a mini-league won by Cameroon. The former Orlando Pirates defender also coached the Swaziland national side where he was appointed in May 2008 until 2010.
