DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane on Friday handed over evidence against Ace Magashule to the National Prosecuting Authority. According to Maimane, the documents contain evidence of corruption that took place when Magashule was Free State premier. He is the current secretary-general of the ANC. Maimane said the evidence was received last year. “We’re now putting it forward to the new national director of public prosecutions, Shamila Batohi, to act on.” Maimane said the information was in connection with corruption around the controversial Vrede Dairy farm project. He said his party would continue fighting for all those involved in corruption to be sent to jail instead of parliament. DA Free State premier candidate Patricia Kopane said the party could not close its eyes and watch corruption unfolding. “There is a lot of corruption in the Free State. People don’t have houses because money has been stolen by people who were supposed to build RDPs for them,” Kopane said. NPA spokeswoman Bulelwa Makeke received the documents on behalf of Batohi. She said Batohi would later communicate developments around the evidence.
