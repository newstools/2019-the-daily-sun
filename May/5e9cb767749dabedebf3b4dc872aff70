THE South African Police Service will be on high alert at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday night to ensure the safety of fans coming to watch the Nedbank Cup final. The curtain for the 2018/19 PSL season will come down when Kaizer Chiefs face National First Division side TS Galaxy in Ke Yona cup showdown. There will be a huge police contingent deployed in and around the stadium to avoid a repeat of fans violence that erupted when Amakhosi lost 2-0 to Free State Stars in the semi-final of same competition last year. The unruly Chiefs fans invaded the pitch, damaged broadcast equipment and cars in the parking lot. This led to fans being banned as Chiefs played two games behind closed doors. This also led to the sacking of then coach Steve Komphela, who is now in charge of Golden Arrows. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane has warned fans without tickets not to come near the stadium. The PSL confirmed that the cup final tickets were sold out last month, just 24 hours after they went on sale. Zwane said: “Those who will break the law will be prosecuted. The law enforcement will be tight in and around the stadium.” PSL chief operations officer Professor Ronnie Schloss said: “Anyone without a ticket is not allowed anywhere near the stadium. We also warned those with fake tickets not to come to the venue.” Gates will be open at 2pm and the first 10 000 fans to arrive will get Nedbank Cup goodies.
