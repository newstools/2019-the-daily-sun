SUNREADERS are asked to help trace gogo’s family. Gogo Nomusa Mabaso (64) died at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital on Friday. But her funeral arrangements have been put on hold because her family is nowhere to be found! Gogo Nomusa lived alone at Msibi House in Rockville, Joburg. According to Dephne Magodongo, who works at the Community Work Programme, gogo never said anything about her family. “Whenever we asked gogo about the whereabouts of her family, she’d look away and not respond,” she said. It’s suspected gogo might have forgotten the whereabouts of her relatives. “The only thing she told us was that she’s from a place called Msinga in KZN,” said Dephne. She told Daily Sun gogo Nomusa was extremely ill. “I never knew her personally. But when I heard she was sick I made all efforts to reach out to her and help wherever I could,” she said. Anyone with information can contact Dephne on 072 492 3413.
