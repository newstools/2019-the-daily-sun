It pains me to see school kids involved in drugs from a young age. It is important for them to stay away from drugs and illegal substances. The drug problem in Mzansi is very serious, with our drug use reported to be twice as high as in the rest of the world. It is wrong for drug dealers to sell drugs to pupils or make the youth sell them. I’m wondering where their discipline has gone. When they are high, young people are uncontrollable and commit crimes. Youth who abuse substances often have a range of problems, including learning difficulties, bad health, depression and poor relationships. Along with peer pressure, other factors influence drug abuse among youth, namely weak parental control, child abuse, imitation, emotional stress, truancy, the easy availability of drugs and weak drug trafficking laws. Drug abuse is damaging Mzansi’s youth and we must do something about it. With the right treatment and support, the effects of drug use can be balanced and control can be regained. We must stand united against drugs, because it’s the future of our kids we’re talking about. Teachers and parents should look out for sealed plastic bags, as well as containers or even sorbet bags which are used to carry drugs. Let us work together to fight this problem and teach our kids about dealing with the pressures of modern life. Heaven help us, because they are our future leaders. ) Nelson Kgatla, Pretoria North
