MPUMALANGA community movement Waya Waya is begging women to stop dumping babies. Another baby was found dumped last week Wednesday in Phola, near Ogies. Chairman Lucas Mtshweni told Daily Sun the trend has been growing since last year. “We are disturbed by the recent heartless deed against an innocent baby at the Iraq section dump. “This must be stopped because the next generation will think it is okay to get pregnant and abort or dump a baby. “This must not be treated as normal, because this is not how we grew up,” he said. Mtshweni said residents needed to work together to support desperate mothers and save lives. “It won’t help us to judge these people without knowing the details. We must work together and stand up for one another. “We will target kasis, because we don’t want such incidents in society. “Let’s not deprive babies of their right to live.” The movement plans to launch a project called Save the Life of an Innocent Child. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said dumping a baby is a crime and called on vulnerable mothers to follow adoption processes.
