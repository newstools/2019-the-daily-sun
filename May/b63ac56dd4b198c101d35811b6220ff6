SUNWHEELS spoke to a BMW specialist mechanic who rides a Honda 1000 250 engine bike at Big Fish Lounge Bekkersdal, west of Joburg. When Venon Dhorobha (34) stopped revving his bike, before leaving for Protea Glen, Soweto, women begged for more. “Biking is close to my heart. After fixing a car, I just ride and cruise around.” Q: When did you buy your bike? A: February this year. Q: Does it have a nickname? A: Not yet. Q: Is it your first bike? A: No, I previously owned a Honda CPR R6 and a Yahama 1000. Q: How often do you get fines? A: I never get one. Q: So, you are confident that you will never break the law? A: It’s my commitment to uphold K53 rules. Q: Who else can ride your bike? A: No one. Q: Why the black colour? A: Because I’m dark-skinned. Q: Do you have a licence? A: Yes. Q: What’s special about your jacket? A: It’s comfortable and makes me feel special and safe. Q: When did you start riding? A: Some 12 years ago. Q: How far have you travelled? A: Eswatini, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Q: What do you think about other road users? A: Some take their personal problems to the road and drive reckless. Always remember,that there are other people who also use the road. We should value everyone’s life.
