Many marriages have been destroyed by alcohol. Couples must prioritise their marriages and stop putting booze first. I hate seeing marriages falling apart because of alcohol. Relationships are built on trust, but many alcoholics lie or blame others for their problems. It is time for people to stop drinking heavily because their behaviour affects their families. Other financial problems may be the indirect result of alcohol. An arrest for driving under the influence could cost thousands of rands in fines, court fees and car insurance increases. South Africa is already known to have a drinking problem, with the country ranking among some of the worst in the world for its levels of alcohol consumption. Let us not allow booze to destroy our marriages. Spouses must put their marriages first and strive to respect, trust and honour their partners. Some peopleâ€™s marriages are good, but the problem arises at the end of the month. Husbands and wives become abusive and disrespectful to each other. Tembisa
