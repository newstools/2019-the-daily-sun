Addressing the media outside the National Results Operations Centre in Tshwane, Fikile Mbalula said that the ANC is humbled by these elections. “Getting 10-million votes is not child’s play,” Mbalula said. “The results are a result of hard and dedication of this leadership led by President Ramaphosa who became  a change changer in these elections,” Mbalula said. The message of renewal is getting to our people. They are saying we trust you but it is not enough. “Sorry Malema, sorry DA there is no party,” Mbalula said talking about the results in Gauteng. ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile said that looking at what they are now compared to 2016 the ANC is now going. “It means the voters have once again come back to say we have confidence in the ANC,” he said. The election results have not yet been declared but as things stand the ANC has leads national elections with 57.6% of the votes. The DA remains official opposition with 20.77% and the EFF 10.79%.
