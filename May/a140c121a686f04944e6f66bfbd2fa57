STUART Baxter says he is settled on nearly 80 % of his Bafana Bafana team for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. With the finals in Egypt just over a month away, the Bafana coach still has a tough schedule, with trips overseas to monitor players, leading up to the big kick off against Ivory Coast on 24 June. Baxter also has to run the rule over several youngsters he will be picking for the upcoming 2019 Cosafa Cup, some he is keen to take along to Egypt. “The squad isn’t nailed down yet. But when you see it, you’d be surprised a bit,” said Baxter. “We do know more or less who is going. We also have options. But 80% we are about there. “Remember, we select 23 players, plus the four younger ones. The most difficult part is always who to leave out. But there is not going to be ten sort of outrageous selections.” Among the selection issues Baxter faces are: Baxter, however, will take a reduced squad of 22 to the Cosafa finals, a blend of youth and experience, explaining they needed to work within a financial framework. “I will take the first few days and hand over to assistant Molefi Ntseki for continuity,” said Baxter. The Briton also welcomed the “group of death” in the Afcon, but cautioned Bafana face a herculean task. “When I said it was a good group I didn’t mean it was an easy group,” he explained. “We’ve got some new players internationally and this group is a real challenge. “I think it presents three different tests. It’s going to be a test of character, a test of tactical nous and of self-belief. Those three tests are what we throw down as a gauntlet to our players. If we can get past the group stage, I think we can be dangerous.”
