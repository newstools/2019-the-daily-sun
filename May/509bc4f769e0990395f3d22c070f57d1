ARTS and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa encouraged people to promote African languages at home and at school. Mthethwa was handing out certificates on Friday to Nelson Mandela University language bursary recipients. The minister encouraged parents to teach children their mother tongue to achieve real freedom. “Democracy has to be underpinned by a true South African language. Government cannot do anything if parents send their children to schools where they don’t speak African languages. The Schools Act allows the SGB to decide language policies. Society should see the value of language. “We have to prioritise teaching of Xhosa at Nelson Mandela University so people of this province will benefit. “We have developed a new museum to achieve that. Language forms a big part of our identity.” Sign language interpreter Asanda Katshwa said: “The issue of language is an emotional issue. Sign language is not yet an official language. “The Schools Act supports sign language as a means of communication but few teachers can teach it perfectly.” Bursary beneficiary Lukhanyo Sigonyela said: “Our languages are still suffering because officials speak 90% English to citizens when addressing issues, excluding their own languages. “The country is burning because officials address people in English. As long as we are taught in a language that isn’t ours, we will keep failing.” The event was attended by traditional chiefs, who also spoke out about the overuse of English by officials.
