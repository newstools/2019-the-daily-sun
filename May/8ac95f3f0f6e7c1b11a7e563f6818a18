SHE carried her baby for nine months, but instead of raising the child she allegedly left the baby for the dogs to feed on. Cops are looking for the woman after the mutilated body of a newborn baby was found on Wednesday afternoon. Residents of Schoonplaas squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said a passerby saw dogs helping themselves to human flesh and rushed to the squatter camp to call others. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the baby’s right leg and private parts were missing. The body was taken to the government mortuary in Springs. A case of concealment of birth was opened and cops are looking for the suspect. Anyone with information must please call 08600 10111. “Mums must decide early in their pregnancy whether they want to abort or give their babies up for adoption,” said resident Tumelo Mohlomi. “We’re not going to allow a situation where a baby is born to be killed. “We understand some women take a decision based on circumstances. But resorting to throwing them to dogs is not acceptable.” Fuming residents said they would check to see if there was a pregnant woman whose bulging tummy had suddenly gone. “She’ll have to explain where she took the baby,” said a resident. Social worker Mary Mdlambi called on mothers who needed help to visit social workers.
