RESIDENT of Chiawelo, Soweto, are gatvol of speeding drivers in the neighbourhood! They said they’re tired of seeing their children being run over by speeding cars. “The drivers show no remorse. They just drive away,” said Elizabeth Tembe (50), a resident. Elizabeth told Daily Sun that’s why they decided to block roads with branches and stones. “It’s frustrating because no one can be held accountable. “We can’t watch over our children all the time,” she said. “Sometimes the children are knocked down on the pavement.” Daily Sun ran stories recently of people knocked down by cars in the area.  Yvonne Maluleke (36) said: “We closed that road, and today it has speed humps.” Joburg Roads Agency spokeswoman Zoleka Jika said: “We erect speed humps after they’ve been approved. “We can’t just get a call from the people and then do what they tell us. “People must also remember that not every road can have a speed hump.”
