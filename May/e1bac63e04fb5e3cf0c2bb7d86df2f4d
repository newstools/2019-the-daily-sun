 RESIDENTS were gatvol after a woman dumped the body of newborn baby in their kasi on Sunday. The community of Emfuleni in the Vaal was alerted to the grisly find by a man looking for scrap metal at an illegal rubbish dump. Community leader Thozama Mkhangeli (45) told the SunTeam how shocked the community was to hear such dreadful news. “We were all shocked and angry about this incident. We don’t know who could have dumped the child here. “We tried to find out whether there was anyone in the area concealing a pregnancy, but there was nobody.” Olwethu Motata (31), said the body must have been dumped in the middle of the night. “I used this road at about 9pm with my husband and there was nothing there,” she said. Mkhangeli said it was difficult to know who the culprit could be as many people dumped rubbish there. Nisiphiwo Madubela (44) said she was angry with whoever had done this. “This amounts to murder. Why don’t these people give birth and hand over the child to social workers for adoption? There are people who are desperately trying to have kids out there but cannot.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said an investigation was underway. He said an inquest docket had been opened and that circumstances around the incident were being investigated.
