THESE pupils are proof that nothing will stop them from achieving in life. Kids at Khanyisa School for the Blind in Port Elizabeth have been taught to garden and are growing spinach, mealies and other crops. Deputy principal Alex Stoffels said they also have a herb garden and the kids tell the difference between herbs and vegetables by using their sense of smell. “The gardening project helps our kids in different ways. “We teach them to grow crops and look after them. They also benefit by eating them. “It helps develop their sense of smell and touch. This is good for them, as some are semi-sighted and others are totally blind.” Stoffels said the project taught the kids to be responsible as they have to clean and look after the gardening tools. “We also teach them leadership skills as we arrange them in groups where they learn to share ideas.” Stoffels said drought affected the project but they came up with solutions. “We were given a 5 000- litre tank. It took some time to fill because it wasn’t raining much. “We also want an orchard where kids can grow fruit.” Grade 4 pupil Minashrey Peacock (9) said she really enjoyed learning about plants. “The garden is good for developing our smell. We also enjoy the food when the herbs are cooked.”
