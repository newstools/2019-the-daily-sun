THE rail enforcement unit is satisfied after a cable thief got a 12-year sentence suspended for six years. He pleaded guilty in the Cape Town Magistrates Court last week. Another 27 suspects were denied bail and will remain in custody until their next appearance. “The majority of suspects pleaded guilty because of the solid evidence provided by Prasa investigators,” said Metrorail Western Cape regional manager Richard Walker. The enforcement unit was formed in October to fight crime and sabotage on railways. It consists of Metrorail, the City of Cape Town and the department of transport. “Statistics bear testimony to the work the unit has done,” he said. MMC for security and safety Jean-Pierre Smith said: “Commuters have a right to travel safely and reliably, and we’re committed to doing everything possible to make that a reality.” Transport MEC Donald Grant said they hope to reduce crime.
