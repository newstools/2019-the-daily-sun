MPUMALANGA Sunbirds wing defender Tumelo Nkoe reckons competing against male counterparts in the upcoming Telkom Netball Premier League will help escalate her game to the next level. Nkoe was excited when she found out that a Zimbabwean male team will be among the 13 teams that will compete in the competition scheduled to start on 10 May at Rembrandt Hall in Pretoria. The matches will be televised live on SuperSport. Said Nkoe: “It’s a great opportunity to have other teams on board as it will keep us on our toes. In the previous years, we’ve had only provincial teams. It’s always a challenge to play against male teams and this will help raise the standard of netball in the country.” Nkoe is confident that Sunbirds will finally win the trophy that has always been lifted by the Free State Crinums and defending champions Gauteng Jaguars. She added: “We are working hard to ensure we win the competition, and this year our chances of lifting the trophy are better because we don’t have the Proteas.” Netball South Africa (NSA) partnered with Telkom for the new season after SAB (Brutal Fruit) pulled out as sponsors last year. President of Netball SA Cecilia Molokwane said the sponsor will help girls get competitive action ahead of the Netball World Cup to take place in Liverpool, England, from 12 to 21 July. Said Molokwane: “Telkom never waited for the World Cup to believe in us. They believed in us long before the World Cup (2023 in Mzansi) was announced and it meant a lot to us. We want players to know that we value them. “So though Telkom we will do wonders for the girls.” Molokwane revealed that players will get better incentives compared to last year. “Yes, players will be paid better than last year together with coaches and their assistant,” she added.
