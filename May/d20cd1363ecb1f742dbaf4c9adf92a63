STHEMBILE Rasmeni (55) and his son Mpumelelo are lucky to be alive, and it’s all thanks to SunHero Unity Lekgoro. Unity was passing by when she saw flames coming out of the roof of the family’s house in KwaThema extension 2, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday night. She ran to the house and knocked on the door until Sthembile woke up. “We could have been burned in the house, had it not been for my neighbour,” he said. Unity said she was happy to help the family. “I believe the angels sent me there so I could see the flames.” Residents told Daily Sun it took three water tankers from Ekurhuleni Emergency Services to kill the fire. Sthembile said the trouble started two months ago after municipal workers worked on a light mast next to his house. “We moved into the house in 1999 and we never had problems,” Sthembile told the People’s Paper. “But then workers tampered with the mast two months ago, and my neighbours and I started having a problem with the electricity. It was tripping often, and the mast light was flickering.” Ekurhuleni municipal officials visited the house to investigate the cause of the fire.
