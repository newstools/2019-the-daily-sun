WHEN gogo Zulugirl Mphyoane was found dead at her home in February, her family suspected her grandson Ofentse was responsible. But cops recently revealed a burned body found in March belonged to Ofentse! Residents of Phiri, Soweto, suspected Ofentse killed the 64-year-old gogo because he often demanded grant money from her. His body was found next to Bhongo High School in Moroka in Soweto. Police identified him through DNA testing. Their investigation found the body was dumped at the school by three people. Relative Walter Mabeba (54) told Daily Sun the trouble started when Ofentse found out his dad, who died more than 10 years ago, had left him money in a trust fund which had grown to R1,5 million. “He told his friends, who killed the gogo. The money would only go to Ofentse when he was older and they thought it would be released if they killed the gogo. “They found out the money would still not be released and killed Ofentse to get rid of the evidence.” Two suspects appeared in the Protea Magistrates Court yesterday. They were denied bail and ordered to appear again Wednesday. Moroka cops spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said a third suspect was still on the run.
