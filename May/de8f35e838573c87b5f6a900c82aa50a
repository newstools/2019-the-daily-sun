GOGO Khangelwa Vuthula said she started voting in 1994, but nothing in her life has changed. The 73-year-old from Nyanga in Cape Town said she was frustrated by lying politicians. “I have never seen any change in my life. I lived in a backyard shack in 1994 and I still live in the same shack. I voted because I live in Mzansi,” she said. Gogo Khangelwa told the SunTeam she had heard many promises from politicians in suits. “When it comes to election time, they come in their suits and give you goodies, but after you’ve voted, they don’t come back again.” The gogo said she was promised a house 20 years ago when the ANC was still in charge of the Western Cape. “I did not want to vote this time, but ended up doing it because when I was growing up, we were not allowed to and this right is precious. “I’m not doing it for any politician but for myself,” she said. The gogo said getting a home would have allowed her to leave something for her grandchildren. Her neighbours told the SunTeam they had been trying to help the gogo get a house with no success.
