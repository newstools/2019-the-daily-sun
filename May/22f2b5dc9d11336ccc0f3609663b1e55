“THE humiliation of women seeking employment must stop now.” These were the words of Mpumalanga DA leader Jane Sithole at a protest march. Sithole, accompanied by DA spokeswoman Refiloe Ntsheke and party supporters, marched to Mbombela Police Station to hand over a memorandum calling for the full investigation into a sex for jobs case reported in July. Two Mpumalanga women laid criminal charges against a supervisor at Rob Ferreira Hospital who they claim demanded sexual favours in return for jobs. Sithole said police told the women their case was thrown out of court based on the sexual acts being found to have been consensual. But they said neither of them was told anything about an investigation, nor were they told of a court date or to appear in court. “Sexual predators who strip women of their dignity must face the full might of the law. It is unacceptable that this case is being swept under the carpet,” she said. Sithole said the national DA will launch a commission of inquiry into the practice of sex for jobs to protect jobseekers and restore the dignity of those pressured into granting sexual favours.
