GOLDEN Arrows coach Steve Komphela says they are in this league to compete and not act as “party poopers”. Their crucial Absa Premiership match against Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Tuesday night (7.30pm) is one such game where they will be competing for points and not spoil anybody’s party. Sundowns, who crashed out 2-1 on aggregate in their Caf Champions League semi-finals against Wydad Casablanca at the weekend, are desperate for points since the PSL is the only possible trophy they can list this season. Victory against Arrows will take Pitso Mosimane’s side to the summit of the PSL log to 56 points, which will be two above second placed Orlando Pirates – with one round matches left to conclude the 2018-19 PSL season on Saturday. The Citizens were party-poopers in Cape Town on Saturday. They held Bucs to a 2-2 draw which set the Soweto giants back by two points. But Downs’ challenge is that Komphela’s Arrows also have the desire to finish the season in the top eight bracket, which means they need to win their remaining two matches, starting with tonight’s game. They are 10th on the log with 36 points from 28 games, two points adrift of eighth-placed Highlands Park. A win for the team from Durban will see them jump to eighth with 39 points, level with seventh-placed Kaizer Chiefs. Said Komphela: “We are no party poopers! We don’t want to spoil people’s good lives, but we are here to take care of our lives. We’ll give it the best that we can. With the qualities that Sundowns have, with the qualities that Bidvest Wits have and their pedigree, we just have to fight and get in the top eight.” This year’s title championship will be decided at the weekend when Sundowns will make a trip to Goble Park for a date against Free State Stars, and Pirates will wrap it up against Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium.
