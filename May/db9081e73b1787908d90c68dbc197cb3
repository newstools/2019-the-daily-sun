THE PSL have lodged an appeal against the League disciplinary committee sanction meted to Mamelodi Sundowns.Sundowns were ordered to pay a fine of R250 000 instead of being docked precious points for fielding an ineligible player. The PSL disciplinary committee had been found guilty of fielding Wayne Arendse while ineligible to play in their Absa Premiership fixture against Bidvest Wits on 7 October. But it appears the League are of the view the punishment was not commensurate with the transgressions and are seeking relief. They want the appeal to be upheld and sanction of awarding the match to Wits with a 3-0 goal advantage instead of the monetary fine.
