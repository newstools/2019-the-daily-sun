HE STOOD helplessly and watched as his house was bulldozed last Wednesday. Jan Makhae (76), from Boschkop in Tshwane, said he had been living in the house for 69 years. The madala said he was tricked into agreeing to move. Jan said Louis Muller, who owns a part of the plot, sent a man and woman to his house when his kids were not there. They told him Louis wanted him and his family to leave the plot as he wanted to start a development there. “I refused and they said if I don’t move they will chase me and my kids from the plot, or when I die my kids will be thrown out as they don’t have any rights to the plot,” he said. “They said Louis bought a place for us at Lethabong squatter camp and we’d get a title deed. “I signed as I wanted to give my kids and grandkids a home.” He said when he told his kids, they got angry. Days after signing, they received a letter saying they must leave and bulldozers came and demolished the house. But Louis told Daily Sun the madala agreed to move. “The children have no say over what happens on the plot. Only their father can decide if he wants to move,” he said. “The place we’re taking them to is well developed. I have built a nice house for him and his family and they’ll have a title deed for that place.”
