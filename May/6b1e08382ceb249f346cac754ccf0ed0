YESTERDAY, the DA expressed concern about dumped ballot boxes found in Limpopo. These were found in the street during special voting yesterday. Spokesman Solly Malatsi said the party wanted answers from the IEC. Malatsi said although the IEC was reportedly investigating , the party wanted assurances that there would be no ballot box tampering. “The matter is worrying and we want the IEC to give the nation assurances about the security of the ballots. All must be accounted for and must not be in the street,” he said. “We will raise it with them provincially and nationally.” It was not clear how the boxes found in Tzaneen made it to the street, but it happened after IEC workers threatened to down tools. Chairman Glen Mashinini said the IEC was working to confirm if the dumped boxes were indeed there. He said they would only comment once they had all the information.
