FOLLOWING a number of semi-final exits at the ICC Cricket World Cup, the Proteas head to this year’s showpiece with the unwanted “chokers” tag. They’ll be eager to lose the tag forever and finally break their hoodoo after seven failed attempts in the past. The Proteas, who currently sit third on the ODI Rankings, arrive in good shape having won six of their last seven ODI series. South Africa, who have gone into previous tournaments as one of the favourites to win, haven’t been afforded the tag this time around. This is something they seem to be comfortable with, though, as it is likely to ease pressure and expectation, allowing the team to perform at their best. India, Australia and hosts England are tipped to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup, with the Proteas expected to battle it out for fourth spot with West Indies and New Zealand. But Captain Faf Du Plessis and his team will quietly go about their business in an attempt to create pleasant new memories at the tournament which has brought heartache to the nation in the past. They boast a seam-dominant attack led by youngsters Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi, who will be assisted by arguably the greatest fast bowler of the century, Dale Steyn., as they look to blow away opposition batsmen in what is expected to be batting-friendly conditions. On the batting front, the Proteas’ hopes will rest on the young Quinton de Kock, skipper Du Plessis and theever-reliable Hashim Amla’s shoulders. Amla, though, hasn’t been in the best of form heading into the tournament but will be hoping to turn things around on the biggest stage. Said Amla: “This year, I’m happy not to be earmarked by anyone. We know how good we are, so we just want to come and enjoy it.” The Proteas have the honour of kicking things off against hosts England at the Oval in London on Thursday in what promises to be a thriller of a match to start the tournament.
