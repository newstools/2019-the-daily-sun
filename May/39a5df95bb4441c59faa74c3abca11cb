UP until their fairy-tale run in the Nedbank Cup which ended in glory, not much was known about lowly TS Galaxy. But now, the National First Division (NFD) newcomers will be remembered forever after becoming the first team from the second tier of Mzansi football to lift the Ke Yona Cup. They caused perhaps the biggest upset in the history of South African football when they defeated Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs at a packed Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday to be crowned 2018/19 Nedbank Cup champions. WHO ARE THEY? TS Galaxy F.C. is a South African football club based in KwaNdebele in the Mpumalanga province and they play in the NFD. The club is named after its owner, Tim Sukazi who purchased the league license from Cape Town All Stars in May 2018 and formed TS Galaxy. Sukazi, a well-known player agent, then moved the club from Cape Town where it was based to his home town of KwaNdebele at the beginning of the recently concluded NFD season. Itâ€™s the first time the people of KwaNdebele have a professional team in their backyard. And now, they have etched their name in the history books, 10 months into their existence.
