THREE men aged 27 to 35, thought to be Mozambican, are expected in court soon. They were bust for possession and dealing in drugs with an estimated street value of R60 million in Kaapmuiden, Mpumalanga on Tuesday. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the police received information about two Toyota Prados with Mozambican registration numbers. They were said to be carrying a massive load of heroin. “The vehicles were spotted and stopped. One of the cars tried to drive off but was no match for the police. Drugs were found in the spare wheels.” Community safety MEC Pat Ngomane praised the police for busting the men. Ngomane said drug dealers must be completely removed from communities, as they destroy people’s lives. “It’s high time for dealers to be severely punished. Drugs have a negative impact on the country and economy.” He said government spends millions on dealing with health challenges brought on by drug use in many communities. “The country runs the risk of not having future leaders if these people are allowed to live in our communities. “Young people are now caught up in this epidemic, which destroys their minds and bodies.” He also said: “As for the two cops found in possession of dagga, we need to send a strong message that the police service is only for those with integrity.” Last month, another package of heroin valued at R2,5 million was seized on the N4 at a roadblock held during Easter.
