pupils were urged to stay away from drugs and criminal activities as they would be arrested and land in jail. Mpumalanga Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane said this during his visit to MALWANA Primary School in Bushbuckridge on Tuesday. Three years ago 10 pupils, two of whom were pupils at the school, died after being run over by a drunk driver. The pupils were allegedly coming from a tavern when the incident occurred. Ngomane also told pupils to stop going to taverns as they could die the same way. The MEC donated R25 000 and sanitary towels to the school. “I was touched by the accident. I promised to come back here to try my level best to assist the pupils of this school and keep them away from illegal things,” he said. Ngomane told Daily Sun he hoped the money would be used to buy tablets which would entertain kids and ensure they spent more time at school. “We believe if the pupils are given more work to do, they won’t have time to linger about. “We want to give them more school work as this will keep them away from taverns.” Principal Richard Randela expressed his gratitude to Ngomane. He said they didn’t expect his kind gesture and they believe it will help pupils develop their education, security and social advancement.
