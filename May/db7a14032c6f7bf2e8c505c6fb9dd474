ANGRY parents want the department of education to act against a school. This is after 49 pupils who live at the Albini High School in Ntshongweni, west of Durban, were admitted to St Mary’s Hospital on Sunday. They allegedly got stomach cramps after eating breakfast. A parent (35) said she got a call from a friend of her daughter (15). “She told me my daughter was seriously sick and that all of them got sick after eating bread, gravy and viennas. “When I got to the clinic my daughter was unconscious and she and others were transferred to hospital.” She said parents believe the school wouldn’t have told them if the kids hadn’t notified them. “That is wrong. They are gambling with our kids. As parents we need to be told about everything that is happening with our kids,” she said. KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said the department was aware of the matter and had sent a delegation to investigate. “We will take it from there. If any wrongdoing is found, school officials will face the music. The department has never not taken action against wrongdoing,” said Mthethwa.
