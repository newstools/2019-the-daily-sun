He also lost his job the same year and couldn’t afford to look after his 11-year-old son Siphamandla. To make matters worse, he lost his ID and couldn’t afford a new one, which meant he couldn’t get a job or apply for child support grant. “The only thing that came to my mind was to take my own life so I could do away with the pain I was going through,” he said. “I couldn’t look after my son. “He was forced to go to school with a torn uniform and on a empty stomach,” said Manelisi, from Nyanga in Cape Town. After hearing about the family’s struggles, the Sanco leadership in the area came to their rescue on Tuesday. They donated food, and money for Manelisi to apply for a new ID. Nontombi Ntleki, a member of the organisation, said the family’s living conditions were unbearable. “I tried to get a piece job for Manelisi after I heard about his situation but when I asked him for his ID, he told he didn’t have one,” said Ntleki. Lumkile Msila, secretary of the organisation, said: “We didn’t expect to see a person living in such inhumane conditions. What we want is for him to get proper help. “His shack leaks whenever it rains and the floor is always wet. “He doesn’t have food and his child doesn’t have a proper uniform. As Sanco, we are doing everything we can to assist,” said Msila. He urged anyone who can help to come forward. Shivani Wahab, Sassa spokeswoman in Cape Town, said: “It should be noted one of the intentions of the child support grant is to ensure that children attend and complete schooling. “It is therefore a requirement that a school attendance certificate be produced for children aged between 7 and 18 years old.” She advised Manelisi to visit the Gugulethu Sassa offices to apply for a grant.
