MANY soccer followers of our generations would agree that Emmanuel “Scara” Ngobese was a rare gem. He was born with natural talent and an ability to entertain supporters and win matches at the same time. He was easily at home playing at a jam-packed FNB Stadium for Kaizer Chiefs or “ebhuqwini” (on the dusty, gravel grounds ) in the townships during various off-season tournaments in the Gauteng province. Those who know him well as a tiny-tot in Katlehong on the East Rand where he grew up, will tell you he did not fulfil his potential or play his best diski in the PSL. Amakhosi coach Ted Dumitru knew how best to use him. It was at that period that he dazzled, excelled and led Chiefs to winning the title. Born in Katlehong in 1980, Ngobese played for local clubs before he joined Chiefs' youths. When he could not get a place in the club's first side, he left for Moroka Swallows. However, he returned to Chiefs and won widespread admiration for his dribbling skills. A showman on and off the field, he had a weakness for snazzy German wheels which he changed almost as often as his underwear. Ngobese also played for Hellenic, Tembisa Classic, Zulu Royals, Thanda Royal Zulu and first division side United FC. His career and life were cut short at the tender age of 29, when he passed away after an illness in May in 2010. Sadly, he missed the 2010 FIFA World Cup in Mzansi.
