Bosasa fat cat Angelo Agrizzi was robbed at gun point at a petrol station in
Fourways. The
incident reportedly took place on Thursday afternoon. In the
video, Agrizzi’s car can be seen pulling up at the petrol station. The CCTV
footage shows the driver looking for what seems to be a bag. He then
talks to the petrol attendant for a while and then the petrol attendant can be
seen opening that rear door and taking out the bag. Just after
giving the driver his bag, two gunmen run up to the driver’s door and rob him
off the bag. The Citizen
reported that Agrizzi said he doesn’t believe it was an ordinary crime. He reportedly
told The Citizen that the men told him to ‘stop talking’. According to
Agrizzi it was a planned bullying effort to stop him continuing testifying
about Bosasa.
