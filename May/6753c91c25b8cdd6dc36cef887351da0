FORMER Lily Mine workers opened an assault case against Mpumalanga cops on Monday. They claim the police assaulted them last Wednesday while trying to remove them from the mine. The workers had been camping at the mine for more than two weeks when the incident allegedly happened. The workers were camping with residents and the families of 2016 mine collapse victims Pretty Nkambule, Solomon Nyirenda and Yvonne Mnisi. They demand justice for the three victims. They said they received a court order from the mine which stated they had to leave the premises within 10 days. But they claimed cops removed them before the deadline had lapsed. They said five of them were bust and released on the same day. According to Masotja Nkosi, who claims to have been assaulted, a group of police came to the mine and started to attack them. He said they were shocked because they were not fighting but defending their rights. “Ten cops came straight up to me. They shoved and choked me. They then pushed me into the back of a police van and locked me in. I was surprised because I didn’t do anything wrong,” claimed Masotja. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini confirmed a case was opened. He said they were still waiting for a report to see if the case is an Ipid matter.
