GONTSE Ntshegang has come a long way since she used to feel awkward on stage. The 36-year-old actress from Phalane, Ramokokastad in North West, told Daily Sun the performing arts have taught her to be clear, vulnerable and to deal with personal issues. “I nearly gave up on my studies but my teacher at the National School of the Arts stopped me,” she said. “I recited a poem about death and applied all the emotions to my dead father Daniel Ntshegang. “I told my teacher I loved my father very much and cared about him. She told me to focus on those feelings.” Gontse then studied drama at Wits University, where she met Xoli Norman, Kgafela oa Magogudi and Tsepo wa Mamatu. “They sharpened my skills and took my acting to another level. They taught me to respect human beings and acting space at the same time.” Gontse played various roles at Wits and then went to the Market Theatre, where she acted with James Ngcobo and had her first starring role. “I was in The Lion and the Jewel where I played five characters and worked with artists such as Sello Maake Ka-Ncube, Fezile Mpela and Nthati Moshesh.” The play opened doors for her TV roles in Scandal, Rhythm City and Muvhango. Gontse has just finished a Dutch series based on Nigerian politics and is also is a part-time acting teacher. She is also a voice-over artist. She’s proud to have worked with international stars like William Hurt. She said people should follow the message from their souls. “Be humble and listen,” was her advice to readers.
