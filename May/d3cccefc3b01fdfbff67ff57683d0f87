RESIDENTS are grateful that Joburg taximen are taking action against drug dealers. Armed with sticks and sjamboks, the drivers took to the streets on Friday. They said they’ve had enough of drug lords and it was time to clean up the city. One said: “Some foreigners are selling drugs but don’t use the stuff, so we took the decision to remove the dealers. “We know where the users come from. We take them home and warn them not to come back to town to steal from hardworking people.” Another taximan said they also warned the dealers, who wouldn’t listen. “I hope they realise we mean business. We’re tired of them ruining young people’s lives.” Joburg residents told Daily Sun they were happy with what the taximen were doing. Lindiwe Maseko praised the drivers and said she hoped the number of drug dealers would go down. “Taxi associations have no idea how influential they can be for change in the country. “They’re the only people I trust when it comes to making moves. I just wish they could see it and use the opportunity. I guess this is the beginning.” Musa Nkosi said he was grateful for what the taxi drivers were doing. Zodwa Nkambule said her cousin was starting to be sneaky. She suspected he was dealing as strange visitors were always looking for him. “I’m just glad that taxi drivers are cleaning up the city,” Zodwa said.
