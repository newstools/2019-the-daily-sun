POLICE in Mpumalanga have called on communities not to take the law into their own hands, no matter what the circumstances. This was after the bodies of two men, aged between 25 and 35, were found burnt to death in Masoyi, outside White River, on Friday. According to police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, the pair and an accomplice were robbing a bakery delivery van when community members attacked them. A week ago, community members in another village in the same area attacked and burnt to death two men accusing them of killing two siblings aged five and six. The girls’ naked bodies were found dumped near a stream in the area. The younger one had been raped. The mob claimed some of the girls’ body parts were missing but a post mortem disproved this. “Our people are always urged to exercise restraint and support the criminal justice process of the land,” said Bhembe. He said police investigations were under way. Anyone with information that might assist the police is urged to contact Captain Timothy Mushwana on 082 977 5870 or the police Crime Stop number, 08600 10111.
