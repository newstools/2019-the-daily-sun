Nigeria have included former Chelsea star John Obi Mikel in their  25-man provisional squad for next month’s Africa Cup of Nations. Midfielder Mikel, now with Middlesborough, last played for the country at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and missed the qualifying series for the 2019 Africa Cup. Leicester City's Kelechi Iheanacho and Villarreal youngster Samuel Chukwueze are also in the squad with the latter opting for the African tournament rather than the FIFA U20 World Cup in Poland. Coach Gernot Rohr and the squad will assemble on June 2 to prepare for a pre-tournament friendly against Zimbabwe on June 8 before departing the following day for Egypt. The Super Eagles will be based at their training camp in the city of Ismailia and tackle Africa’s number one–ranked team Senegal in their final pre-tournament friendly June 16. Nigeria are drawn against Burundi, Guinea and Madagascar in Group B of the Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off on June 21.
