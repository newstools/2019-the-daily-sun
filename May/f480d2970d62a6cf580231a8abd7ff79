BLACK Leopards coach Dylan Kerr says their situation would have been worse had it not been of striker Mwape Musonda’s goals. The Zambian international has scored 16 goals to help Lidoda Duvha occupy 15th spot with 27 points from 29 games, one point behind bottom placed Maritzburg United. Musonda, who currently tops the PSL scorer’ chart, looks set to clinch Golden Boot award as he is seven goals ahead of Bloemfontein Celtic striker Tshegofatso Mabasa and Bidvest Wits’ Gift Motupa, who are tied with nine goals each. Having failed to win their last seven games, Leopards host fourth-placed Cape Town City at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday in their quest to survive relegation. They’ll need their big striker to be on form and pull all the stops to win the game, and hope other results go in their favour to have their second successive season in the PSL. Musonda was last month named the Absa Premiership Player of Month for March/April after scoring six goals in four matches. Said Kerr: “Musonda has been fantastic for us. But to be fair, if it was not for players who set him up, I don’t know where we will be. Credit to everyone. “I thought he was struggling against AmaZulu and the pressure was too much for him to score that penalty, but he did it.” Meanwhile, Kerr confirmed that club captain Jean Munganga was left out against Usuthu on Saturday because he felt the pressure was too much for him. The lanky defender made a series of bad mistakes that cost the club points. But the Congolese is expected to be back in the starting line-up against City. “Jean is one of the best people I’ve known in football. Unfortunately, he has been making mistakes. I felt against AmaZulu that pressure and expectations will be too high for him. “I didn’t bring him down to Durban, I left him at home. Hopefully, he will fight hard to get back into the team against Cape Town City,” added Kerr.
