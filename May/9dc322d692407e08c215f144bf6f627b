She keeps shining against all odds. Singer Thembisile Ntaka will perform at the LASA Sessions at Hard Rock Cafe in Sandton, Joburg tonight. She will pay tribute to the late Busi Mhlongo. Thembisile told SunBuzz she’s excited about the show. “I’ll perform songs from my albums. I’m exited to pay tribute to mama Busi because I believe her music shouldn't die. “Her music is timeless and as artists, we must always keep her spirit alive. When we perform her songs, we teach the younger generation about people who paved the way for us,” she said. The Save Me hitmaker said people should expect hit after hit at tonight’s event. “I’ll also perform songs from my album Thula. I can’t wait to share a piece of me with the audience. I write music based on my experiences and what I’ve seen over the years,” she said. “It’s interesting to see how people respond to what I share with them.” Thembisile said she has grown over the years and has learnt a lot about the business side of music. “I’ve become an independent artist because of that career growth. “I also appreciate how fans have supported my music journey. I’m humbled when I see many people at my shows, and when they buy copies of my albums. “It’s also interesting when people follow me on social media platforms.”
