HER landlord apparently thought she was in her rented room and let four Boerboel dogs out into the yard. But the 20-year-old woman from Bloemspruit, Mangaung, had gone to the shop. When she came back the dogs attacked her. According to a neighbour, the owner had to drag her into the house to stop the dogs from attacking her. She said after the woman came back from the shop it was already dark. “The dogs attacked her when she went around the back. I heard her screaming, but there was nothing I could do,” said the neighbour. “One of the dogs bit her thigh while the others bit her neck. There was blood everywhere.” The SunTeam went to the house, but the landlord was not at home. The tenant is in ICU.  Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a case was opened.
