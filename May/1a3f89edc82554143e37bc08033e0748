 A MUM is facing a murder charge. She allegedly beat her eight-year-old daughter to death for stealing R20 on Thursday. The 31-year-old mum from Ga-Makhushane Village, outside Phalaborwa in Limpopo, apparently beat her daughter with various objects, which caused severe injuries all over her body before she died. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the little girl was found lying dead with multiple injuries all over her body. The mum will appear in the Namakgale Magistrates Court today.
