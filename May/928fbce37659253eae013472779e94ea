The rise of social media added a layer of oversight to the Electoral Commission of South Africa's (IEC) voting process during this year's election. This was said by commission CEO Sy Mamabolo said during his speech on Saturday evening. Speaking at the IEC’s event to announce the 2019 National and Provincial Results at the National Results Operations Centre in Tshwane Sy Mamabolo said that the challenges they faced during this year  made them stronger. IEC Chairperson Glen Mashinini officially declared the election ‘Free and Fair’   The IEC was plagued by a number of objections from smaller parties who complained of irregularities. The DA had also called for an audit of the election results after a number of voters took to social media to show cracks in the IEC's process. This led to small parties calling for a recount of the elections. Mamabolo added that while the exponential growth of political parties presented a great choice to the voters it created a number of challenges to the commission. These included significant cost for ballot papers, space at voting stations for party agents and long cumbersome ballot papers for voters. Mamabolo lambasted media reports on irregularities adding that most of these reports focused on minor cases. He said observer missions had shown that the larger voters majority approved of the voting process.  Mamabolo said 97% of sampled voters found election procedures free and fair. Former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan who was representing, Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) on its observer mission also endorsed the election as free and fair.
