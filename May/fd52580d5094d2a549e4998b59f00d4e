IT took only a day for cops to arrest at least one suspect for Cash-in-transit (CIT) vehicle which happened on Tuesday. This is after various incriminating evidence was recovered in a house in Atteridgeville following a group of robbers who brazenly attacked a CIT vehicle using explosives in Lotus Gardens, West of Pretoria just before sunset. According to cops, the robbers forced the CIT vehicle to a halt after firing shots at it. The guards were subsequently disarmed of their side arms and the suspects used explosives to blow open the safe of the vehicle. In a statement issued by cop’s national spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, the group fled with an undisclosed amount of money as well as the pistols belonging to the guards. “A joint task team comprising of members of Crime Intelligence, the Hawks, the Gauteng Operational Command Centre as well as a National Intervention team worked tirelessly through the night. Intelligence led the SAPS team to a house at Kgokong Street, Atteridgeville where they arrested one suspect and recovered the two vehicles which were used by the robbers,” said Naidoo. The team also recovered a Norinco 9mm pistol which belongs to one of the guards, and ammunition as well as tens of thousands of rands. “A navy blue CIT money bag was also found in the boot of one or the getaway vehicles. The owner of the house was arrested for being in unlawful possession of arms and ammunition and for being in possession of property suspected to be stolen,” he said. Further investigations led the SAPS team to a house in Kuba Street in Kalafong where they recovered a third vehicle which was used by the robbers. Applauding the swift response to the matter, General Khehla John Sitole said "The joint task team is hot on the heels of the robbers and will not rest until they are found and brought to book."
