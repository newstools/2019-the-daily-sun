 A tavern owner has been arrested after shooting a man dead and wounding another in Makosha village in Giyani. The tavern owner is reportedly a police captain at the Modjadjiskloof police station. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the 55-year-old officer, had a squabble with one of his patrons before allegedly shooting the patron dead with his wife's pistol. Mojapelo said when the brother of the deceased interfered, he was also shot and wounded.  "Upon hearing about the murder, the community of Makosha village mobilized and stormed the tavern, looted liquor and other valuables before setting the building alight," Mojapelo said. They also torched four vehicles which belonged to the family members of the arrested suspect.  Mojapelo said two police vehicles were also damaged when the cops tried to calm the situation. Eight suspects aged between 22 and 33 years old were arrested for public violence. “Community members are urged to report any form of criminality to the police and desist from taking the law into their own hands,” Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba said. The suspects are expected to appear before the Giyani Magistrate's Court soon on charges of murder, attempted murder and public violence.
