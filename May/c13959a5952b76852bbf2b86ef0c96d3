THEY say love conquers all and this certainly rings true to
Lexi Van Niekerk and Mandla Hlatshwayo, whose relationship has stood the test
of time. Their story beganÂ  in 2015 on Mzansi Magic's reality TV show Big
Brother Mzansi where they were both contestants. During the show, the pair had
a steamy sex scene during shower hour, which set viewers' tongues
wagging. At the end of the show, Mandla walked away with the ultimate
prize of R2 million and even though their relationship was constantly
surrounded by controversy, the pair pursued their relationship, despite mumurs
that Lexi was only using Mandla for his money. Somehow, the couple managed to stay focused on
their relationship despite the obstacles they faced. Fast- forward to 2019,
they have a child together and seem to have happier than ever. Taking to her
Twitter account, Lexi said she couldn't believe that it's been five years in a
relations with Mandla. "I can't believe it's been five years
already," she tweeter along with a snap of her bae Mandla.
