WHEN Medupi Kgoboko dropped out of university because of financial problems, he started drawing to make a living. His nightmare started in 2014 when he was told that NSFAS would not fund his third year of study. The 32-year-old from Rocklands in Mangaung said he didn’t want to drop out of the Fine Arts course at the Central University of Technology but he had no other option. “I came up with the idea of drawing for money as it was my talent. I started drawing from an early age.” “When I was home the only thing I did was draw. When I was 15 my mum bought me a pencil and a drawing book and those became my best friends. My parents are very supportive.” Medupi said that he believed his drawings would help him raise the money to return to varsity to finish his studies. However, he said his biggest challenge was a lack of capital. “I had no financial backup when I started. I used all the money I had made through part-time jobs. “I sell my work at the gallery when there are exhibitions,” he said. He appealed to SunReaders to sponsor his business. “Getting a sponsor will help me complete my diploma,” he said.
