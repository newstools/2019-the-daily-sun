ON ELECTION days, madala Thamsanqa and gogo Cynthia hold hands and go to the voting station.For them, voting is a reminder of the dawn of democracy and also the dawn of their love.ON THAT FAMOUS DAY IN 1994, THEY FIRST LAID EYES ON EACH OTHER.Thamsanqa Dayidayi (77) and his wife Cynthia (72), from Snake Park in Soweto, met in the queue to vote on 27 April. They later got married and since then, voting has not just been about putting their party of choice into power, but also a reminder of how they met. When Daily Sun saw the couple walking hand in hand towards the voting station at the Well of the Divine Bible Church, the madala was helping his wife. “I’m not only holding her hand today because she can’t walk,” he said. “On all the previous election days I’ve been holding her hand. It’s like going back to our honeymoon.” The madala said he was in the queue all those years ago when he saw a beautiful woman next to him. “She was gorgeous. I looked for a reason to start talking just so I could hear her voice,” he said. “From that moment, my heart gave me the nod.” He said the queue was very long and that gave them time to talk. They got married a year later and they’ve not been apart since. “We are one and nothing can come between us,” said the madala. They live in an RDP house in Snake Park and they both get pensions. The old couple encouraged the young generation to take voting seriously. “It doesn’t matter who you vote for. What’s important is that you do it,” said the madala. “I found love at the voting station. You might find change.”
