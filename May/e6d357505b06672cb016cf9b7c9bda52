A POLICE captain who allegedly gave Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela his passport while he was out on bail was questioned in court yesterday. The North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane issued a subpoena for the captain who allegedly gave Mathibela his passport to travel out of the country. This meant he violated his bail conditions in the murder case of businessman Wandile Bozwana. Although evidence was presented placing Captain Siphiwe Xulu at Mathibela’s home, the former police officer, who has since resigned, said he had forgotten that. Xulu was initially part of the police investigating team into Bozwana’s murder. However, two officers disputed that Xulu was the investigating officer and said he was removed from the case. He was questioned by Mathibela’s lawyer Annelene Van den Heever. She argued that Mathibela complied with his bail conditions, which included handing over his passport and a title deed to his property.
