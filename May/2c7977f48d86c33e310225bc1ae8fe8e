AFTER years of reading about the awful things Boko Haram does, the gang has landed ekasi. Well, sort of. Residents of KwaThema extension 3 in Ekurhuleni said they’re gatvol of thugs who rape and steal. On Wednesday they hunted down the gang and burned down almost 10 shacks believed to belong to its members. Thami Ndlela said: “They do as they please, but we want to show them we’re more powerful than they are.” Residents said gang members who’re as young as 13 have been terrorising them, and it’s time to take back the kasi. Another resident said: “We always hear about Boko Haram, but we never thought we’d have to deal with them.” Residents said they’ve been terrorised since October. However, resident Nicholas Mbatha said he was wrongfully accused of being a member. “I lost my shack and my car was almost burned down. They just stormed into my yard, poured petrol everywhere, and set it alight,” he said. A worried mum admitted her son is a gang member. “We’ve been warning him but he doesn’t want to listen. “Now people have come to burn his brother’s shack.” Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said cases of malicious damage to property are being investigated.
