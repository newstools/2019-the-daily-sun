MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says Bafana Bafana mentor Stuart Baxter should use the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tournament to build a strong side that will qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The former Bafana mentor insists that winning Afcon should not be a priority for Baxter who recently named his 30-man squad for the continental showpiece in Egypt from 21 June to 19 July. Said Mosimane: “We would like to do well in the Cup of Nations and it’s not about winning the competition, but us preparing for the World Cup. As much as we want to win, you must also understand the transition. “For me, Afcon, as much as it’s good, but the World Cup is more important. “You can’t be talking about winning Afcon and at the same time building a team for the World Cup. We want to go to the World Cup, it’s bigger than Afcon, let’s be honest.” Mosimane says Baxter should graduate the Under-23 players into the senior team via the Cosafa Cup to prepare them for the World Cup. “The Under-23s need to be moved. He (Baxter) must go hard on Cosafa with Under-23s in my opinion, but he doesn’t have to listen to me. If he listens and puts the younger ones, the team is inexperienced and they don’t win, then he would have listened to the wrong guy. ““Mokoena (Teboho) and Aubrey Modiba score from a distance, I think we have a very good team that can do well in Cosafa. “Lyle Foster, who plays in France (Monaco), is among the boys who should play. These are the players for the World Cup maybe, so somewhere somehow we need to fight this battle.” Mosimane says Baxter has never called him for advise regarding his players. The Scottish born has called Rivaldo Coetzee, Themba Zwane, Lebohang Maboe, Hlompho Kekana, Tiyani Mabunda and Sibusiso Vilakazi in his squad from Mosimane’s outfit. Added Mosimane: “He (Baxter) hasn’t spoken to me, but I don’t expect him to call me. He is a professional, he understand what to do if he wants to do well in the Cup of Nations.”
