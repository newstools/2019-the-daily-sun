TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach Momcilo Medic believes his side still have a healthy chance of winning the promotional play-offs and secure their spot in the Absa Premiership next season, despite having got off to a slow start. The Serbian tactician has, however, pointed out that his charges will have to double their efforts as they can’t afford to drop any more points going forward. Vhadau Vha Damani, as TTM are affectionately known, currently sit bottom of the promotional play-offs standings after they lost 1-0 to National First Division (NFD) counterparts Royal Eagles in the first match last week. They host PSL outfit Maritzburg United at Thohoyandou Stadium tomorrow (3pm). This is a match Medic has described as a must-win game as his team look to keep their dream of playing in the PSL alive. The former Orlando Pirates assistant coach has been impressed by how his team have played, saying they only need to improve in the final third. “This is a short competition with only four matches. If you want to go up, you have to score goals, without goals you stand no chance of being promoted,” said Medic. “I can’t complain too much about this team. We are playing some wonderful football, but the only thing that is missing is the goals. That’s our main problem at the moment. “But it is good that we have had one week to recover, rest, work and analyse our opponents. We might also look to the bench to try and bring in some fresh legs.”
