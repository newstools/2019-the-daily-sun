A GROUP of women cutting reeds next to the stream that cuts through Motidibi and Dwarsloop villages got the shock of their lives. They found the rotting remains of a man at about 9.30am on Tuesday in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. They called the cops, who took the remains to the government mortuary. Bushbuckridge cops spokeswoman Constable Maryline Mmonwa told the SunTeam: “They led police down the stream, where we found the remains of a man who seemed to be in his 60s.” Mmonwa said it seemed the man died about about three weeks ago. “He was wearing a dark blue sleeved shirt, blue and white striped jacket, khaki trousers and black shoes,” said Mmonwa. She told Daily Sun the dead man had not yet been identified and his remains were being kept at the government mortuary. Mmonwa appealed to residents who’ve lost their loved ones, or have reported people missing, to come forward and identify the remains. She said anyone with information that could lead to the man’s next of kin should call Bushbuckridge police on 013 7995 529.
