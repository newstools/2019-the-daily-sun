RESIDENTS from East Street Hostel in the Pietermaritzburg CBD brought the entire city centre to a standstill on Tuesday night. They were protesting for water and electricity which they claim the Umsunduzi Municipality shut down in the hostel on Tuesday. Resident Ngwane Bhengu (53) said the day they saw three officials enter the hostel in big cars. “They turned off the electricity and water switches. “They put on a big lock to ensure that we couldn’t switch them back on. “When we asked them why they were doing that and how long we were going to live without these two basic needs, they told us they had no idea,” said Bhengu. He suspects the municipality closed off the water and electricity because they haven’t paid rent for a while. “For several years we were only paying R9 per person monthly for a room shared by four men but then the rent went up to R90 per person. “They didn’t give us solid answers so we stopped paying rent,” said Bhengu. Umsunduzi municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha said: “Their water and electricity bill is in arrears. “We have a right to switch off water and electricity for clients whose accounts are in arrears.”
