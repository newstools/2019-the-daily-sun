POLICE in the province made two major busts over the weekend. In the first incident, a 38-year-old woman was bust at the Beitbridge border near Musina. This was after cops searched her luggage and found 15 sachets of crystal meth with an estimated street value of more than R2 million. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “Preliminary investigations revealed the woman was travelling from Harare in Zimbabwe to South Africa.” In the second incident, in the Roedtan policing area, outside Modimolle, police arrested a 39-year-old man. He was found in possession of counterfeit cigarettes while patrolling the N11 and R33 crossroads, near the Rathoke weighbridge. “The police pulled off a Toyota Rav4 vehicle, searched it and found cigarettes with the estimated street value of R80 000. “They also found cellphones and knives. “The origin of the cigarettes will be determined by the ongoing police investigation,” said Ngoepe. Acting provincial police commissioner Major-General Jan Scheepers praised the police for busting the two suspects. The arrested suspects will soon appear in the Musina Magistrates Court.
