National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sithole has conveyed condolences to families of a cop who was killed in Kwa-Zulu Natal. According to Colonel Brenda Muridili, the incident took place on Sunday (26 May) in Pietermaritzburg. Muridili said that the police were called to the scene at 05:00 where they found the boy of the slain officer outside his vehicle with two bullet wounds to his head. Police also found his car on the side of the road. “Seemingly the vehicle stopped after colliding with a big rock,” Muridili said. The officer, a 25-year-old constable, was stationed at Hilton Police Station in Pietermaritzburg. Sithole condemned the cold-blooded killing of the off-duty member at the hands of unknown assailants. "My sincere condolences to the family of the deceased member,” he said. “I have directed the province to afford the families full support during and beyond this time of bereavement.” He has called for a swift conclusion to the case, calling on the investigating officers to get to the bottom of the killing.
