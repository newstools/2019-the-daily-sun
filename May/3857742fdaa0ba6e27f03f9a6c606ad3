Women are known to dominate the domestic worker sector, but this is the 21st century. Daily Sun spoke to SunLanders and asked if they’d ever hire a man as a domestic worker. Many people think it’s terrible, while others think it’s a great idea – but everybody seemed to have conditions. Kabelo Moshoeu said he and his wife talked about it for a long time and they thought they would try it out. “But then I saw the advert of a man looking for a job who said he was good at house work – but he added he had a big 4-5,” said Kabelo. “Now I’ve changed my mind. No male domestic for us. I will clean my own house!” Menzi Nkabinde said he’d only agree to this if the male domestic worker was diabetic. “I don’t mean to be evil, but that is the only way I’d feel safe. I have a very hot wife,” he said. Sthembiso Nemakhavhani said he has no problem with it. “As long as his 4-5 is smaller than mine. I can’t risk my beautiful family.” Zeena Farrell said she loves the idea but wasn’t sure if her husband would allow it. “They are strong enough to move couches and fridges. They don’t take time off for maternity leave or have period pains,” she said. Another SunReader thought he’d make a great domestic worker, but if there was no woman in the house. “I won’t lie to you. I love women!”
