RESIDENTS of Mandela squatter camp in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, fear for their safety. Busisiwe Ntabane (51) and Emma Maphoi (54) said their lives and livelihoods were being threatened by a sinkhole. The women are both unemployed and live on the money they get from renting out shacks in their yards. Busisiwe said they found a small hole next to their houses in January. They quickly reported it but nothing was done. Now the sinkhole is bigger and deeper. “As it was raining in January, the sinkhole grew and became deeper and deeper within two weeks. We contacted the municipality because the small hole was becoming a monster. “Municipal officials came at the end of January. They put a fence around the hole and took some pictures. That was it,” said Busisiwe. She said the officials told them they would be back soon, but no one from the municipality has been since. Emma said their tenants’ lives were threatened. Busisiwe said one tenant had already left because of the cracks which developed around his shack. “Every cent counts and I can’t afford to lose any more tenants,” said Busisiwe. She said she understood why the tenants were leaving. “No one wants to live in a house that could collapse into a hole at any moment,” she said. Ekurhuleni spokesman Nhlanhla Cebekhulu said the city sent specialist consultants to investigate. He said they were currently the process of getting contractors to fix the problem. “We assure the community the sinkhole is receiving executive attention,” he said.
