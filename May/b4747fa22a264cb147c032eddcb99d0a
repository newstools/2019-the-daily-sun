THE International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia was commemorated in Sunnyside, Tshwane last week Friday. The lesbian, gay, bisexual transsexual and intersex community met at the Alliance Francaise offices to discuss how they could tackle the challenges that affect them. Alliance public relations officer Hugo De Groot said the annual event celebrated sexual and gender diversity. “It aims to co-ordinate international events that raise awareness of gay rights abuses and stimulate interest in gay rights around the world,” he said Social justice defender, feminist and activist Azania Sengwayo (25) said she had to deal with violence and hate speech from residents. Azania said the people of Sedibeng in the Vaal called her names. “We receive a lot of cases about violence targeted at us because of our sexual orientation, gender identity and self-expression.” She called on the justice system to take gender diversity cases seriously and prosecute abusers. “We want policies that will be inclusive of sexual orientation, gender identity and self-expression,” she said. African Content Movement member Lesego Morake (31) said residents judge transgender people and they are also bullied at church, school, on the streets and in malls. She said people need to understand them and accept them for who they are. “We lesbians and gays face a lot of challenges from our families, communities and in the workplace,” Lesego said.
