TWO cops’ motherly instincts kicked in when they found a newborn baby on the pavement just after 7am on Wednesday. While Mzansi was casting votes, the Joburg Metro cops were saving the baby’s life. It was inside a black plastic bag at the corner of Twist and Wolmarans streets in Hillbrow, Joburg. Metro cops spokesman Wayne Minnaar said officers Evelyn Mothibe and Nomphumelelo Nhlapo were patrolling when they were alerted by a passerby. “He told them he heard a sound like a cat in a plastic bag and they found a crying newborn. They called emergency services while keeping the baby warm.” The little boy survived the cold weather without any clothes and was reportedly taken to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. Yesterday, the two cops visited the baby in hospital. “He’s doing very well,” Minnaar told Daily Sun. Metro police chief David Tembe praised the two cops. A case was opened and anyone with information is urged to call 011 375 5911.
