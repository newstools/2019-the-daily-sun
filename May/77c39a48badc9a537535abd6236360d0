A STUDY claims all you have to do to lose weight is cry over your ex! According to a study done by TheSole Publishing, an average person cries about 62,5 litres of tears during their lifetime. However, it seems people prefer to bottle up their emotions. The study also states that cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, is linked to obesity. “Many of us know this hormone helps us fight anything stressful. Nowadays, people don’t physically fight for survival, but prefer to sit and stew in their anger,” said the study. “As a result, our bodies think we have used some calories to deal with our stressors and we need to replenish them, even if we haven’t.” Daily Sun asked SunReaders if they agreed with the study. Bongario Shong said he did not have time to think about his ex. “I actually don’t have an ex. I only had people who were sent by Satan to my life.” Pheladi Valentine and Boitumelo Tumi agreed and said they were still losing weight because of their exes. Lungile Sithole disagreed and said: “No matter how much I loved you, when I dump you, I’m done and won’t cry over you.”
