  THE Independent Electoral Commission(IEC) has assured voters who had been  delayed  by late opening of voting stations and shortages of ballot papers that they would be accommodated even if it meant extending voting hours. The commission’s Chief Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo admitted that in addition to delays that were caused by service delivery protests in certain areas, some voting stations had ballot paper shortages. Mamabolo said the shortages were due to ballot papers being not enough as planned. He said this could have been caused by voters voting anywhere in the province as allowed by regulations governing the elections. He added that by 5pm this evening, there were still five voting stations which had still not been opened, four hours before the closing time of 9pm of voting stations. Of the five, one was in Buffalo City, another in Ntabankulu in the Eastern Cape while three were in KZN at Inkosi Langalibalele municipality in the Tukela District.
