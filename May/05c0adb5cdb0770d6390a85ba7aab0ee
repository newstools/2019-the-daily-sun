TS Galaxy are not in the final of the Nedbank Cup by fluke and will give Kaizer Chiefs a run for their money. So says their striker Zakhele Lepasa who is optimistic about their chances of upsetting the Soweto giants and etching their name in the history books. The Rockets, as Galaxy are affectionately known, are looking to become the first team from the National First Division (NFD) to get their hands on the coveted Ke Yona Cup title. They will take on Amakhosi in the sold out final set to take place at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (7.pm). Amakhosi will be the overwhelming favourites heading into the clash against the NFD newcomers who are only 10 months into their existence. Lepasa, though, believes they will be on a level playing field with the Glamour Boys as soon as the first whistle blows at the weekend. “It doesn’t matter who is the favourite, the team that will work the hardest on the day will be victorious,” said Lepasa. “We respect Chiefs as a team but we are coming with intentions to win, not to be second best. “There’s always pressure, especially in games of this magnitude, but I believe if we stick to what we know and are good at, then we stand a very good chance.”
