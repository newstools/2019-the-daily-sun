Freeware, cross-platform messaging and Voice over IP service WhatsApp Messenger  will start displaying adverts in the Status screen from 2019, Softpedia News reports. The action comes after Facebook is said to have put pressure on the business unit to start making money. According to Softpedia, WhatsApp aims to offer more tools to businesses to get in touch with users, and the company announces new ad types that would be specifically aimed at allowing paying customers to contact you on the mobile phone. Ads will run on Facebook’s advertising system, and WhatsApp says it’s confident users will adapt to this new approach. A report from the Wall Street Journal reveals that WhatsApp will charge companies between half a penny and 9 cents for every message delivered to a potential customer.
