The Gauteng education department's online applications to place
learners in Grade 1-8 for the 2020 academic year got off to a glitchy
start. The applications opened on Monday and they will remain open until
July 22. On Monday the system experienced glitches ranging from network
issues to server problems. In Diepsloot where the MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi was at the
Diespsloot Hall for the launch of the applications, things didn't go smoothly
as Lesufi would've have liked. People sat in the long queues for more than an hour as servers
went down. Thembi Nani was at the centre hoping to apply for her twin boys who
are starting grade 8. Nani had to wait for more than 30 minutes as officials waiting for
the servers to come back on. "It looks like they themselves don't understand what the
issue is they been telling different stories since I sat down here," Nani
said. Others couldn't wait for servers, Sebenzile Van Heerden was on the
verge of giving up before the system got back online. Sebenzile had been waiting for more than an hour and he was at the
door all ready to leave when the system went back online. "I was leaving because no one was telling us what was
actually going. We were just sitting there," Sebenzile said. By midday 200 thousand application more than double the number
they had last year had been processed. Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said parents need to
ensure that they apply as soon as possible. “You don’t want to wait until the last minute because you might
not find space,” Mabona said. Mabona explained that some schools were full within 30 minutes
after applications open. He said parents need to ensure that they have a secure fast
network connection. He also explained that using Chrome browser instead of on Internet
Explorer is a lot faster. “We advise people to use chrome so that they don’t
struggle through the process,” Mabona said.
