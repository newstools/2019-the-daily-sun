THE South African Under-20 national team look set to be on their way back home following a dismal display during the underway Fifa Under-20 World Cup in Poland. Amajita’s two defeats in the group stages by South Korea and Argentina has put their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages to below zero. And making it worse is the fact that they have conceded six goals and scored three in the two matches, making them worst losers in Group F. Thabo Senong’s charges opened the tournament with a 5-2 loss to Argentina’s Albicelestes before dropping three more points against South Korea with a 1-0 loss.Even though they are better than Tahiti in Group A, Amajita must score more than five goals against Portugal, whom they are playing at the Bielsko-Biala Stadium on Friday night (8.30pm). Mathematically, they can hold on and score as many goals without conceding against Portugal, but in reality their dream in Poland is already a nighmare. Senong vowed before the tournament that they have learned from their mistakes from Korea Republic in the 2017 finals, but his boys gave it away even though they fought hard. Now history is following them and they look set to board a plane back to Mzansi without a point in Poland, a repeat of the 2017 World Cup where they finished bottom of the group. Senong admits to playing well in the first half but there is no point to show. “The only thing that let us down was failure to convert chances we created. “Korea Republic got one scoring opportunity and converted,” he said. Senong is aware Portugal won’t come easy, but are beatable. “We’ll approach that game as professionals, push for the desired result,” added Senong.
