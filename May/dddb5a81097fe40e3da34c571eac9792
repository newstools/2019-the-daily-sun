WHEN her sister went to visit her boyfriend, Sanah Makola (43) thought she would be home soon. But it’s been three years and her sister hasn’t come back home. Sanah, from extension 23 in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane said her sister, Seipati Makola (29) and her boyfriend Boisie Maribi (30), have gone missing. She said the last time she saw her sister was when she left to visit her boyfriend. “She usually visited him for a few weeks or even a month but I would check up on her and we always communicated. Now things are different. “After a year both their phones went off,” she said. Sanah said she went to the police station with the boyfriend’s family because they, too, were worried. “They were not at Boisie’s place and nobody knew were they had gone.” She said Seipati was like a daughter to her. “Our parents died early so I have been acting as her mother. “I am not okay at all. “I pretend to be fine, but I can’t go on living like this. “It is difficult for me to eat, sleep and continue with my life while she’s out there,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi confirmed that the two had been reported missing.
