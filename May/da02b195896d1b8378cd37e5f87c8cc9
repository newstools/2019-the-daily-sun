Mini has
announced that the updated Mini Cooper Countryman and Clubman will have 225kW
and 450 Nm peak torque! This makes
the new JCW models the most powerful models in the history of the brand. The power
is produced by a 4-cylinder TwinPower Turbo engine. This is the
same engine that's used in the BMW X2 M35i. It's the engine that will be used
in the upcoming front-engined BMW M135i. In the Mini,
power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-Speed Steptronic sports transmission. There's a
mechanical differential lock on the front axle to keep the understeer in check. The Clubman
with its hearse-like doors will do the 0-100km/h run in 4.9 seconds, 1.4
seconds faster than the old model. The
Countryman will take 5.1 seconds, 1.5 seconds faster than the previous model. The new
models also get a new JCW sport brake system.
