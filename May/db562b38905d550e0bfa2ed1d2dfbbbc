Influencer marketing has become such a prominent part of Instagram and Instagram is looking to weed out bought followers and likes. Instagram is now working to crack down users who’ve purchased likes and followers in order to inflate their standing, and potentially profit from the same by pitching their perceived reach and relevance to unknowing brands. Last November, Instagram launched a new push to remove likes and followers gained through third-party apps, and this week, code hacker Jane Manchun Wong has found some new warning messages within Instagram’s system which appear to indicate that another advance on this front is coming, with specific messaging listed for accounts that have been found to have used third-party tools to gain followers. New messages have been recently added which read:- “You may have shared your username and password with an app offering likes or followers. Using these apps goes against our %s, and continuing to do so may result in your account being further impacted.” - “Change your password to stop these apps accessing your account. - ”Using Apps to Gain Followers Isn’t Allowed” According to Social Media Today there’s no specific info as to when and how these messages will be applied, but as noted, it suggests that Instagram may well be looking to ramp up its efforts on this front yet again, which, as most would agree, is a positive step for everyone. Well, except those running following and like bot farms who’ve been profiting off of fake engagement for years.
