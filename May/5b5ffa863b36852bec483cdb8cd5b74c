THESE THUGS thought they’d hit the jackpot when they stole cows. They slaughtered the cattle and packed them into a taxi. But their skorokoro had a flat tyre at Tafelberg Street in Finsbury, Joburg. And cops from the crime prevention division spotted the taxi. When they stopped to investigate, the men ran away. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Carmen Hendricks said a white Toyota Hi-Ace minibus was parked on the side of the road without a tyre. “Next to it was a white Kia Soul. Members saw one unknown male running away and the driver of the Kia trying to drive away. They managed to stop the vehicle,” she said. Cops searched the cars and found carcasses in both of them. “The driver of the car said he only came to help the other two men load meat as their car had a problem. He gave information on the whereabouts of the two men They were found covered in blood on their clothes and hands.” “The men failed to give police reasonable information about where they found the carcasses. They were arrested for possession of suspected stolen stock and will appear in court soon.”
