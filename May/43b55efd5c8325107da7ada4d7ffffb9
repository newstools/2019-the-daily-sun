HIS heart is in a different position, and this has led to complications. Senzo Dhlomo (13) from Alexandra, north of Joburg, is mocked for having legs that are not the same size. Speaking to Daily Sun, Senzo’s gogo Francisca (52) said when Senzo was seven they discovered his heart was on the right side rather than the left like most people. “He often got flu but it worried me that he fainted whenever he fell sick. “I then took him to the clinic, where they later made the discovery. He is being treated at the Joburg General Hospital,” she said. Francina said she’s worried as her grandson’s leg keep growing. “It’s really frustrating him because at times he’s in so much pain.” She said her grandson has become violent as a result of being bullied and mocked. “Even older people say these horrible things,People are cruel.” she said. Francina said she wished for her grandson to get help before things got out of hand. Dr Mpho Mashadu said the swelling of the leg was caused by the heart problem. “Some people with heart problems tend to have swelling in the legs,” said Mashadu. “They can go for a second opinion, but I doubt the hospital isn’t doing anything to contain his leg growth.”
