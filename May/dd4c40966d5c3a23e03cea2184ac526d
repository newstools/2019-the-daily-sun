VERY rare that Farook Kadodia issues out instructions – unless only if it is a desperate measure. The Maritzburg United chairman’s call to his coach Eric Tinkler is that they must shoot their KwaZulu Natal opponents, Royal Eagles, down to the ground in their NFD play-offs on Wednesday afternoon at Chartsworth Stadium (3pm). Much as their stay in the PSL looks confirmed, with just a point needed to prove their case, Kadodia wants Tinkler to win the match to dash any hopes Eagles might have. “The battle is not over yet,” Kadodia said. “And yes we need one point to retain our PSL status. But I want all the three points from this game. I want to sign off from these play-offs in style. The players deserve this.” Kadodia, whose side are now on six points following two wins, is relieved that his club are on the brink of retaining their status. Tinkler’s side, who have a game in hand, are three points ahead of Sazi Ngubane’s Eagles who are on three points, level along with bottom of table side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhadila. The Team of Choice ended the 2018-19 season in 15th place narrowly avoiding automatic relegation after being at the foot of the table for the majority of the season. For Eagles, who are bankrolled by Durban tycoon Shawn Mpisane, face the daunting task to topple the more experience Maritzburg who have hit form at the right time in the final weeks of the season. The Team of Choice are unbeaten in their last five matches including two wins in both play-off matches. Eagles co-coach Sazi Ngubane will not let the pressure get to him or his players: “We will treat this game the same way as others. We want to win and if we don’t win it will be tough luck for us. Remember this is first time the club has been in the play-offs. “For us it is big achievement. It’s better to have tried and failed than not to have given it a full go.”
