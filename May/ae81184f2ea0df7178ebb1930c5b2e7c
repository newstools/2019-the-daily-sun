A
driver of a get away car was arrested after crashing into a tree, following a
robbery in Phoenix KwaZulu Natal (KZN). An
unlicensed firearm, a police radio and a large sum of cash was recovered
following a shootout between business robbery suspects and members of Reaction
Unit South Africa. “Reaction
Officers were on patrol in the area when they were alerted to an armed robbery
in progress at a Shell Service Station. “As officers
approached the business, they noticed a white Toyota Etios parked on the
forecourt in front of the convenience store. Staff inside the store were seen
lying on the floor,” RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram said. Following
that three-armed men exited the business and fired a hail of shots in their
direction. Balram
said Reaction Officers returned fire when the gunmen got into their getaway
vehicle and sped off. A chase
ensued following that, and the suspects continued firing at the officers, who
returned fire and shot the getaway vehicle several times. “The
driver of the Toyota Etios lost control of the vehicle as he attempted to
corner a sharp bend. “The
vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a tree. The robbers exited the
vehicle and fled. Reaction Officers managed to arrest the driver,” Balram
added. A
9mm Luger firearm with a filed off serial number, a large quantity of cash, were
recovered in the vehicle.
