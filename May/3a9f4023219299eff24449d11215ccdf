ABOUT 500 people gathered in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, on Friday to pray for an end to kids disappearing. Before the event started, it came out that a missing child had been found dead. The body of Ntokozo Ginya (9), whose disappearance was reported in Daily Sun, was found in a dam. Bishop Andile Tila said they’re worried. “We wish God could protect all the children in our area. At least Ntokozo’s family will find closure.” Nokulunga Thabethe, whose daughter Amahle is still missing, said she needed to find closure. Ntokozo’s madala Michael was devastated. “We lived in the hope of finding him alive, but it was not in our power to control the situation. God had other plans,” he said. He appealed to SunReaders to help the family with donations to bury Ntokozo. “I’m not working and can’t afford to bury my grandson with dignity,” Sergeant Harry Manaka said Ntokozo’s body was found in a dam in the Masechaba area. Friends who were with Ntokozo when he was kidnapped said he was forced into a white VW Golf. Cops are investigating.
