AFTER a long week of work, Ignatius Mandebele went to collect his pay. But instead of getting his R1 200 weekly wages on Saturday, he was bitten by dogs! The 31-year-old said his boss set his dogs on him and then went to the police station to claim Ignatius had been harassing him. However, the boss’s trick didn’t work and he ended up being arrested for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Ignatius, from Montana in Tshwane, said his boss asked him to work on the day of the incident. “He was fitting kitchens and cupboards and he asked me to help. I thought he was going to pay my salary as well.” But Ignatius said his boss soon started acting strangely and set his dogs on him. “I became worried because his dogs are vicious. He told me he had set them free because he wanted to feed them. “Suddenly, my boss told the dogs in Afrikaans to bite me and they jumped on me, biting my face and hands. I couldn’t protect myself because he was holding my arms from the back.” Ignatius said after the incident, his boss got into his car and drove to the police station to tell his own version of the story. The police confirmed a case of assault was opened at Kameeldrift Police Station. The suspect recently made his first court appearance.
