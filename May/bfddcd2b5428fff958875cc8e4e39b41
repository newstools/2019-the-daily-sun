TWO of the three convicts who escaped from prison are back behind bars. Aviwe Nkwalase (29) and Sizwe Mhlana (33) were rearrested on Thursday. They escaped from the Eastern Cape prison on the night before the election. Police spokesman Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana said they received a tipoff. Cops were told the pair was moving between Zwelitsha and Sweetwaters in King Williams Town. “Police arrested them at a park in Zwelitsha,” he said. The two were in prison for robbery with aggravated circumstances. “Police are still investigating whether or not the two committed other crimes after escaping and where they were hiding,” he said. “The two will face additional charges of escaping from lawful custody and are expected to appear in the Middledrift Magistrates Court soon.” Kinana said the hunt for Andisa Vas, who was serving time for attempted murder and robbery, is still under way. “People are warned not to make any attempt to approach him as he might be armed,” he said. Police asked anyone with information about the whereabouts of Vas to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
