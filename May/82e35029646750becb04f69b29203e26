EFF leader Julius Malema believes Mangaung mayor Olly
Mlamleli and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule should head to prison. Leading a service delivery march in Bloemfontein on Tuesday,
he said: “Olly will no longer be able to eat full chicken and drink a two litre
Coke by herself as prison has an eating programme. To wake up at night and open
the fridge will not work in prison.” About 5 000 EFF members started a march at the Old Ramkraal
Prison and met Malema in the CBD. Then they went to the Bram Fischer Building. EFF provincial chairwoman Mandisa Makhesini said corruption
in the Mangaung Municipality was the worst. “Olly uses money to buy doeks, slippers and fat cakes,” said
Makhesini. She said people had to drink dirty water and wanted sewage
leaks to be attended to within 24 hours. Malema told supporters the ANC failed to clean black
people’s areas. “Cleaning requires no qualifications but reflects your
upbringing. Magashule and Olly were raised in a dirty environment and they
bring it to you,” he said. “We have a prison feared by hardcore criminals in Kroonstad
and that’s where Magashule is going. He will meet Free State thugs so they can
ask him what he did with the money.” The memorandum was accepted and signed by chief of staff in
the mayor’s office Tsekiso Mokoena. Party threatens officials with jail
