Kaizer Chiefs’ embarrassing Nedbank Cup final defeat at the hands of minnows TS Galaxy on Saturday was arguably the biggest upset in the history of Mzansi football. Amakhosi had been dreadful to watch for the most part in the recently concluded Absa Premiership season, but very few would have imagined them plunging to new lows. The gulf in class between the two sides was massive, and in all honesty, Amakhosi had no business losing to Galaxy. With all due respect to the newly crowned Ke Yona Cup champions, something must have gone terribly wrong for the Glamour Boys to lose a cup final against an NFD team established 10 months ago. Here are some of the things that went wrong for Amakhosi 1.  It looked like Kaizer Chiefs went to the final without a proper plan, they looked clueless about how they would overcome their opponents. 2. Some might have even questioned the coach’s starting line-up which lacked balance, Chiefs were crying out for a focal point in attack. 3. There was a wrong call of judgment when it comes to their midfield, they could not assume control of the midfield where Galaxy’s Nation Ndlovu and Sizwe Mdlinzo got the better of Willard Katsande and Andriamirado Andrianarimanana. 4. Coach did not identify their own weaknesses in the first half and took time to make substitutions. 5. Dan Malesela was tactically superior to Ernst Middendorp on the night it appeared.
