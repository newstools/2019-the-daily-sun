WITH more than 1,1 million kilometres on its odometer, a Tata eight-ton dropside is in its second decade of delivering exceptional service. According to Charles Waller from Meyerton-based animal feedstock manufacturer, Hi-Performance Feeds, he bought the truck with his father in 2007. When buying the Tata 1518 for their business, they didn’t believe the truck would still be able to carry eight-ton loads a decade later, every day across Gauteng, the Free State and Mpumalanga. Charles said: “Without the truck, we wouldn’t have been able to expand the operational capacity of Hi-Performance Feeds as effectively as we have. “The truck has played an important role in the company’s growth. Although it’s covered more than 1,1 million kilometres, it’s still working as hard as it ever did.” He said he and his dad tried several brands before buying their first Tata. “Despite being more expensive, none of the vehicles lived up to our expectations,” Charles said. “The low cost of ownership and the latest five-year/500 000km warranty ensured we made the right decision.” When they first told people they’d bought a Tata, many told them they were making a mistake. Their Tata plies routes from Meyerton to Stilfontein, Klerksdorp, Magaliesberg, Hammanskraal and Kriel It also delivers feed to retail outlets in Jozi and Pretoria. For 90% of its service life, it has been piloted by only two drivers. “Each of them find the truck comfortable,” he said.
