A FEW weeks ago, President Cyril Ramaphosa launched a campaign to clean up East London in the Eastern Cape. But in Mlungisi kasi, Komani, rubbish has been piling up on the streets. Resident Nokuthula Jacobs (45) told Daily Sun: “Our municipality doesn’t collect the rubbish. When there’s too much stuff, we are forced to burn it. Municipal leaders are busy with politics while we suffer.” But Siziwe Gononda (53) said when she saw rubbish, she saw extra money. “I collect things that can be recycled and sell them. I know other people are angry about the situation, but it benefits me,” she said. Gcobani Msindwana, a spokesman for Enoch Mgijima Municipality, said residents were dumping rubbish illegally in open spaces. “Most of our areas were cleaned, including the spaces around Top Street. But people have started dumping rubbish again,” he said. “We’ve conducted community awareness programmes, including erecting signs telling people not to dump illegally. “We’ve also urged residents to assist the municipality by reporting illegal dumping to the community services department on 045 807 2603 or visiting our offices during office hours.”
