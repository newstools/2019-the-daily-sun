The ANC in Gauteng is confident that the new MECs and \members of the Legislature have the necessary skills required to vigorously pursue the agenda of 'Growing Gauteng Together'. "We welcome the appointment of a new Executive Council by the Premier of Gauteng Comrade David Makhura and also wish to announce the appointment of Caucus Executive and Committee Chairpersons in the Legislature," said ANC Provincial Secretary Jacob Khawe. He said both the comrades deployed in government and in the legislature constitute what "we call Team Gauteng". "Through the appointments, a clear message yet has been sent that the ANC has listened to the people of this province when they said they want effective, efficient and faster service delivery," said Khwawe. He said Team Gauteng brings together women and men, who amongst them, have a wealth of governance experience over a period of time. "It is younger, better educated and it introduces renewed energy which can only augur well for the people of Gauteng who ultimately must experience the impact of this team through their daily lived experiences as quality service delivery is accelerated. "We are confident that the Team Gauteng will take our province to new heights guided by the commitment to Growing Gauteng Together. In the same light we take this opportunity to appreciate the work done by the previous team during the 5th term and believe in the 6th term the new team will be able to build on the solid foundation laid. "Team Gauteng has its work cut out for them, and will have to hit the ground running to make sure that job creation, addressing the housing backlog, tackling crime, overhauling the health system, modernising education, transforming of public transport and eliminating corruption takes centre stage in this term of office."
