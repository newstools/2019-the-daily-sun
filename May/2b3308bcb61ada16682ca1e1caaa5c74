THIS time last year, she was making preparations for her big day, because she was engaged to a man she thought would be hers forever. But that didn’t happen, as she put the wedding on ice amid reports of infidelity. And now actress and radio personality Pearl Modiadie is happier than ever. She now has a mystery man, who is rumoured to be from France and they have been going on baecations together. She also recently bought a house, so life is good for Pearl, but wasn’t a smooth ride. Taking to her Instagram account, the star recounted she was heartbroken last year, because she had to cancel her wedding. “I was heartbroken this time last year. There was a change of plans in my love life & we had to cancel a property purchase. I moved in with my sister’s family for a week then lived in a hotel for a couple of months. I move into my home in less than a month. Setbacks are temporary,” she wrote.
