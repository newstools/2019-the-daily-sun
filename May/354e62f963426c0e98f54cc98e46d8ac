DESPITE the
slow entries to this year’s Soweto Marathon, the race’s Trust chairperson Sello
Khunou is not losing sleep. Last year’s
entries were sold out within weeks while in 2017, about 30 000 runners
registered for the event. That
prompted the organisers to increase the number of entries by 10 000. This year
entries were opened in April to cater for the masses that still have interest
in entering. According
to race organisers, only 21 000 of the 40 000 entries had been sold by Tuesday
morning. Some of the
reasons affecting the slow rate of the race entries could be the high entry
prices. They call
it the “People’s Race”, but runners feel that it’s  expensive now to enter
the race. The
traditional and historic marathon is scheduled for Sunday, 3 November starting
at the iconic FNB Stadium. The
starter’s gun for the 42,2km will go off at 5.30am, followed by 21.1km at
6.30am, while casual runners in the 10km will begin their race at 7am. The entry
for the marathon is R300 with the half-marathon runners coughing up R220, fun
runners are expected to pay R180. Khunou said
logistics of managing the race are now becoming expense. Khunou
said: “We’re still giving out free T-shirts. We buy water and soft drinks at a
cost.” The route
of the race will take runners through historic sites like Chris Hani
Baragwanath Hospital, Hector Pieterson Memorial, Morris Isaacson High School and the 16
June Memorial Acre, Vilakazi Street, Regina Mundi Church and, Orlando Stadium
and Credo Mutwa Cultural village. Entries
will close on 31 July. But Khunou
is confident that the race will be sold-out by the beginning of June.
