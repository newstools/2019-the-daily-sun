THE family of a cop who was shot and killed by a colleague want the suspect to rot in jail for robbing them of their breadwinner. Sergeant Malusi Sibisi (47) was apparently shot and killed by a 30-year-old cop after an argument at the Ekombe cop shop in Nkandla, northern KZN, on Friday. Sibisi and the suspect both worked at the cop shop. Buza (65) said his brother was the only one who worked in the family. He said he didn’t know what would become of the family as Sibisi helped them with everything. “We’re devastated. We never thought our brother could be killed by one of his own. “If anything, we thought he’d die fighting crime.” He said cops had promised the family they’d investigate. Buza said what hurt the family most was that Sibisi was about to get married. “His fiancee is in pain. Our sister is also not taking this well. She can’t even eat.” The suspect was expected to appear in the Nkandla Magistrates Court on a charge of murder.
