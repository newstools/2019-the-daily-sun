IKAGENG township in Potchfestroom, North West, is home to the Malentsi stokvel. The 24-member group was formed in 2008 to encourage young people to save. “Most young people mistakenly think that simply because they’re still young, they don’t have to worry about saving,” Thomas Nthusetsang said. “When you start saving at a young age you give yourself more power through compound interest.” He said throughout the year the group saves and members share the interest among themselves at the end of the year. “We’ve instilled a culture of saving among ourselves.” According to Thomas, stokvels teach people to be disciplined. “Stokvels are all about the culture of saving and I always encourage people who say they cannot save to start by joining stokvels and soon after that they see the importance of saving and start saving and investing more,” he said. Malentsi stokvel’s 24 members each contribute R800 a month which all goes into their savings account, of which some of it is shared in December as the rest goes into savings. “We want to attract more youngsters and reach out to other areas. We’re not about profit-making. We socialise,” he said. He said any stokvel that doesn’t have a constitution or guiding principles is doomed to fail. “Every member should abide by the rules and you have the support of other members in difficult times,” he said.
