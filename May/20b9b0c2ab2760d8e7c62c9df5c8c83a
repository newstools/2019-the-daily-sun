THE body of a 63-year-old man was found hanging from a tree on Sunday. The man from Ventersburg, Free State, killed himself after news broke that his granddaughter was pregnant, allegedly with his child. The 14-year-old, who lived with him, was allegedly repeatedly raped by the man. The child’s mum, who is the man’s daughter, told the cops after she found out. The man was in hiding from the police before he was found dead. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said: “A case of rape was reported to the police in Ventersburg. The girl was sharing a house with her grandfather, who allegedly repeatedly raped her between January and June last year. This was revealed during a family meeting when the grandfather verbally attacked the victim. “It was also revealed the victim became pregnant last year and was taken to a doctor for an abortion. “The grandfather disappeared after hearing that the matter was reported to the police. An inquest docket was registered for further investigation,” said Mokhuoane. Thabong commander Major-General Apaphia Modise said community members should urgently report cases of sexual and domestic violence. “We’re mandated to see to it that culprits are brought to book for justice to take its course,” he said.
