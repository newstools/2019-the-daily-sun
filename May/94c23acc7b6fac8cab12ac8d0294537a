THE pupils liked hanging out together during break time. But unlike many boys, they weren’t doing anything naughty. Instead, they were studying and that produced good results. But this isn’t good news – in fact they were moered for their results. Six grade 11 boys from MH Joosub Technical Secondary School in Lenasia, south of Joburg, were beaten by another group of boys on Tuesday. They were allegedly beaten for being ‘too bright’. One boy’s nose was broken and another boy was hit with a metal object on the forehead. The two boys were rushed to hospital, and four other boys had minor injuries. Daily Sun spoke to some of the boys and their parents. One of the boys (18) said: “ he didn’t know why they were attacked.“We didn’t do anything to anyone. We just studied. We still don’t know why we had to be beaten for that.” Another pupil (18) said: “he heard from other kids at school they were beaten for being smart.“I was told some of the schoolkids felt we were trying to be golden boys by studying during break time while others did nasty things. They wanted to teach us a lesson.” “We are not naturally smart, but we work hard. Nothing stops everyone from doing the same.” The boys said they wanted something done to their attackers punished. The gogo (71) of one of the boys told Daily Sun: “school was supposed to be a safe place for pupils.“I don’t expect to hear my grandson had to be rushed to hospital because he was beaten at school. It shouldn’t happen again to my grandson or  any other child.” she said. The department of education said it was deeply concerned and  condemned any form of violence in schools. Spokesman Steve Mabona said officials will be sent to the school to establish facts around investigate.
