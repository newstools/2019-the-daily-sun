THE kasi is called Diki and everybody from Lusikisiki, Eastern Cape, knows where it is. But you won’t find the name Diki on the sign post next to the parked Avanza taxis. Instead, the name displayed is “Dick” “At first I thought it was a mistake,” said commuter Yolando Somhlahlo (37). “Then I asked a taxi driver, who said they won’t change it.” The SunTeam spoke to taxi drivers who actually love the name. Taximan Jack Gqugqugqu (45) said what matters was that the passengers knew what it meant. “Just get used to it. We won’t change the name. It’s too late for that now,” said Jack. “Our passengers have never complained. They don’t have a problem.” Passenger Mzikayise Nxumalo (37) said they decided to keep quiet. “As long as they go to the right place,” said Mzikayise. “We don’t care how they write it, but they should’ve written the correct word, which is Diki. “People from other areas may think it means the residents from the area actually have big 4-5s.”
