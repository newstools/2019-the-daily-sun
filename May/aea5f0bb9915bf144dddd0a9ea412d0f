THE recent picture of Pitso Mosimane and Wydad Casablanca coach Faouzi Benzarti sharing a light moment is slightly deceiving. The two antagonists simply played to the gallery, reinforcing the myth that the battle between Mamelodi Sundowns and Wydad is confined to the pitch, following their Caf Champions League first leg semi-final encounter in Rabat, Morocco, last week. Yet, beneath the warm embrace, firm handshake and smiles, lies a steely desire for either to reach the Champions League final. Wydad won the first leg battle 2-1 at Prince Abdellah Stadium a week ago. But the war is far from over as the two gear up for an epic semi-final finish at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (3pm). The two sides have developed a rivalry of sorts over the last three years, in which they have faced each other seven times. The encounters have barely been without fireworks – on and off the pitch – and another crunch clash can be expected. Their last match in Pretoria was marred by Wydad-inspired scuffles, which prompted Mosimane’s famous remark: “We will fight fire with fire!” “The days when my players were cheese boys (physically and mentally soft) are over. Now we fight fire with fire. There is no room for cowards,” he continued. Sundowns have now lost two of the seven, won two and drew one. But that pales into significance given that the Brazilians have mastered the art of winning against Champions League opponents at home. They have also been scoring some goals, too, having netted 11 in their last three Champions League match at home. There is also the fact that it will be the first time Sundowns play the return match at home. “The game is in Wydad’s hands. The best thing is to give your best,” Mosimane concluded.
