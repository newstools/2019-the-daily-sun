WHEN Tshudufhadzo Takalani (26) became unemployed she applied her mind and came up with a great way to earn a living. Today the biotechnology graduate from Vaal University, who lives in Delft, Cape Town has used her skills to start a perfume company. She said she did an internship at Coca Cola in Joburg in 2016 but then spent seven months job hunting when it ended. “I thought I should do something for myself. I remembered what I learned at university and that was my starting point.” After a huge struggle she finally got a job but she still put her plan into action. She started her company in October last year. “I did a bio-processing module in my course that taught us how to manufacture products using biological systems. “I wanted to start my own business and today it is a dream come true,” said Tshudufhadzo. She told Daily Sun she had to overcome her fears first. “You have to get going and make things happen. If you make mistakes, learn from them,” she said. Her company, Our Chudu completed its first batch of perfumes on 31 October. Besides perfumes she plans to manufacture other cosmetics. She named her fragrance for men after her son Uranga.
