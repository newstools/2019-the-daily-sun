CLEANERS and security guards at Park Station downed tools yesterday, demanding an end to outsourcing. The workers at the Joburg train station said they wanted Prasa to hire them on a permanent basis. Protester Sammy Ngobeni (36) told Daily Sun workers were tired of job uncertainty. “Our contracts are renewed on a month-to-month basis. That worries us a lot because it doesn’t guarantee our jobs are safe,” he said. “Service providers benefit a lot from our hard work. We’re calling for an end to outsourcing.” Mpho Morolane, the general secretary of the National Association of South Africa labour organisation, said workers felt neglected. “All the workers here want to be insourced as they are currently unable to get work benefits. They want better salaries compared to what they are getting now,” he said. Morolane said the service providers were “doing dodgy things”. “First of all, the workers are not getting payslips and are not provided with work overalls. That alone goes against labour regulations,” he said. A regular commuter said he was concerned by all the dirt at the station. “The situation around here is not healthy for passengers using this train station. The toilets are extremely dirty with urine flowing all over the floor,” he said. Prasa spokeswoman Nana Zenani confirmed that the company was aware of the protest and was monitoring the situation. “We are ensuring there is no service disruption, which might affect our capability to deliver a reliable, safe and predictable service,” she said. Prasa has written to the service providers asking them stop the protest..
