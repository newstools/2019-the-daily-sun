People had called for it to be cancelled before it even aired, and now there’s a petition against it. READ: CHEATER BUST BY ATCHAR! Kholofelo Masha, who started the petition, said: “This show destroys lives. Sign the petition to have it taken down.” But according to the SunFamily on Facebook, the show must go on! - Mokgadi Mokadi said: “Great show. Those who want it cancelled are afraid of being exposed.” - Ncedo Mshushwana said: “Let the show roll. Jub Jub is fixing the country.” - David Mohlamonyane said: “I see no problem with it. It’s nation building.” National Men’s Conference spokesman Lesego Maake said they’ll discuss the show at a Tshwane meeting this weekend. Yesterday, Taboo in Sandton tweeted: “Jub Jub is officially banned from all our venues.” Moja Love’s Lindiwe Mbonambi said they did not expect the show would be a hit.
