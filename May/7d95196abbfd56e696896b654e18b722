Baroka FC chairman Khurishi Mphahlele has revealed no bonuses will be played to the players should they survive relegation in the 2018/19 campaign. Bakgaga will face an epic battle for survival when they host Maritzburg United who are languishing at the bottom of the table in a do or die final game of the season at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3pm).. The Telkom Knockout champions are in 12th and a victory will guarantee their league status for another season in the PSL. However, despite the significance of the clash, Mphahlele says no extra monies will be paid out in the event of survival. "Nothing has been promised to these boys, they already earn salaries. This is their job," said Mphahlele. "Nothing has changed, Baroka is the most consistent team in the league. When we won the cup in December, we were in position 12, and even now we are still in position 12. Our season has been very consistent at Baroka FC. "Yes, they will be looking for a win, but that is not going to be our problem. They put themselves there, they are down there because of their own doing, us we will not do anyone any favours. "Three points will remain with us on the weekend. Our fans must come in numbers. It's Mother's Day [on Sunday] and women will enter for free." All of Saturday's Absa Premiership matches are set to get underway from 15:00. -SPORT24
