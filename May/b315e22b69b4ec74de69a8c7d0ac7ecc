  THEY WERE there to collect the spirit of Mduduzi. But it turned into a double tragedy for the Ngubane family when cops shot his brother, Sazi. SAZI DIED IN THE SAME PLACE HIS BROTHER HAD DIED A FEW DAYS BEFORE. The family from KZN came to fetch the spirit of Mduduzi on Monday. MDUDUZI Ngubane (29), was stabbed to death last Wednesday, and his brother Sazi Ngubane (31) was shot dead by cops a week later.Angry residents of Yeoville, Joburg told Daily Sun Sazi fired shots in the air as part of a ritual to honour his brother.“When the police came, he put his gun on the ground and surrendered but the cops shot him at close range while his hands were in the air,” claimed a resident.“We are angry because Sazi was just performing a ritual. Why would police kill him for that?” asked Lillian Nkosi, a friend of the family and a witness.Some of his family were crying uncontrollably as his body lay on the cold tar road and couldn’t speak to Daily Sun.Sazi’s sister Ntombi Ngubane said Sazi’s shot in the air was just part of a ritual.“We came to fetch Mduduzi’s body and lift his spirit. Now we are shaken by another death,” she said.“We don’t know where we are going to find the money for another funeral.Angry residents damaged two police cars and threw stones at the cops. Kenmere Road was blocked.“There was no need for the cops to kill Sazi because he surrendered and was not a danger to them,” said resident Mlungisi Khoza.Captain Sifiso Mabizela said two Yeoville cops heard the gunshots.“They responded and saw a man firing shots in the air. They told him to surrender but he refused to comply,” said Captain Mabizela.“Instead he pointed the firearm at cops and officers retaliated. He was shot below the armpit and in the stomach and was certified dead by paramedics.”His firearm has been taken by police.Moses Dlamini of Ipid said they are aware of the matter and a case of murder is being investigated.
