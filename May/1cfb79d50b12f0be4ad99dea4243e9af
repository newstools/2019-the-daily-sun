MAY, International Masturbation Month, is dedicated to self-love and self-pleasure. And from next year a new curriculum will be introduced to teach pupils about masturbation to try and reduce sexual offences committed at schools. An article in yesterday’s Sunday Times reported that the new programme would cater to pupils from grade 4 to matric. It said lower grade pupils would learn about agreeing to things in friendships while older pupils would be taught about sexual consent. Clinical sexologist Dr Marlene Wasserman, known as Dr Eve, said society always sidelines issues associated with masturbation, making it difficult for people to talk about it. “Masturbation is the most practised sexual act around the world, but there’s so much shame attached to it.” Social media users were divided on the initiative. Some saw no problem with it as it is most boys’ first sexual experience. Others said it would corrupt pupils. The department of education couldn’t be reached for comment.
