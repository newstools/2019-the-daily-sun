HIS angry family want answers after his decomposed body was found in the ceiling of a hospital. Dudu Mthembu (57) from Amaoti in Inanda north of Durban said they rushed her brother Sandile Sibiya (63) to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Durban on 9 May. She said he had a leg fracture after a wall collapsed on him when he was helping their neighbour fix his house. “He was last seen on 11 May when some family members visited him in hospital. “They asked about his whereabouts when they found his bed empty and were told he might have been transferred to another hospital.” She said they asked the hospital to check with neighbouring hospitals but no hospital had accepted the transfer of a patient under his name. Dudu said they then learned in the news that a body was discovered in the hospital ceiling. “They denied us permission to view the body, saying we needed an affidavit from the cops. “We did so and that is when we saw that the dead person was indeed our loved one.” She said they identified him by a scar on his forehead. “The hospital must tell us how he died and ended up in the ceiling with a fractured leg, which suggests he couldn’t get up there on his own,” said Dudu. KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said after an assessment, it was decided that Sandile should be transferred to Addington Hospital. “But he disappeared afterwards. “He was reported missing by nurses and a a missing person’s case was registered with cops after an unsuccessful search.” She said the department and cops were investigating and they would take action if any wrongdoing was found.
