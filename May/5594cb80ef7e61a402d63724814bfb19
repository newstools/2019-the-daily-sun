THE people of Hombe Village, Lusikisiki, want the local dam to be fenced in. According to the villagers, some people use the dam for evil things. Mandixole Rafuza (36) told Daily Sun: “When we have funerals or any other events that need water, we get it from the dam. “But last year we were shocked when a body was found in the dam. Some people use the dam to fulfil their evil deeds. The dead man was not from this area.” Another villager said kids had drowned in the dam. “Our councillor should help erect a fence around the dam so as to prevent our kids from drowning. “Our kids’ lives are at risk around this dam.” Lonwabo Zintonga (37) said villagers from surrounding areas sometimes use the dam to draw water. “When bodies are found in this dam, people will think it’s us dumping them here,” said Lonwabo. Lulama Kilana (46) said they had been doing their best to keep kids away from the dam. “Our councillor should help us erect a fence around the dam. Our children are not safe around the dam,” Lulama told the People’s Paper. Councillor Sihle Ndarane said they were trying their best to have the dam fenced.
