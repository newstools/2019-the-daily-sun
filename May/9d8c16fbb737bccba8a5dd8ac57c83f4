The EFF in
Mpumalanga says it will open a criminal case against the IEC after a video surfaced
on social media of a woman allegedly tempering with ballot papers. They allege
the woman in the video was transferring ballot papers into the IEC's official
ballot box while the other one was seen assisting to seal the box. The video was
shared by one of the party agents in Gert Sibande regional offices, Ermelo on
Monday and Tuesday and it has raised eyebrows about what was happening. In the
video, a man who said to be a party agent can heard asking the two women why
they were doing that along the streets and not at the centre. The women can
also be heard telling the alleged party agents not to take pictures of them. Collen
Sedibe who is the leader of the EFF in Mpumalanga told the Daily Sun that they
will be opening a criminal case against the IEC and said the ANC was allegedly responsible
for this. Sedibe said
the ANC and the IEC were one and the same thing as they don’t want to see other
parties winning the elections. Acting
secretary of the ANC in Mpumalanga Lindiwe Ntshalintshali said as the party
they were informed that those IEC officials were from home visits for the
special votes and that when they came back, they forgot to deposit the
envelopes into the box. “We are
told the matter is been investigated and all party agents confirmed that they
were from home visits.” She said
this was one of those human errors being blown out of proportion as the ANC
believes in free and fair elections. Contacted
for comment, IEC spokesman in the province Sibusiso Nkosi said they will hold a
media briefing later in the afternoon.
