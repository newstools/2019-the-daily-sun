VICTIMS of the devastating floods are still waiting for the help promised by government. More than 70 people died and thousands were displaced when houses were washed away during heavy rain last month. Khumbulani Lembede (57) from Dassenhoek, west of Durban, nearly lost his entire family when his four-roomed house was washed away. Khumbulani told Daily Sun he and his wife and six kids are now staying with a relative. The relative has a family of 14! “We were hoping by this time we’d have received something, but nobody is thinking about us anymore,” Khumbulani told the People’s Paper. “I lost everything. I desperately need a one-roomed house in which to live with my kids. “My relative has been helpful, but she’s kept us for too long.” He had high hopes when President Cyril Ramaphosa, mayor Zandile Gumede and officials visited him and promised to help. Khumbulani had asked for a grader to pull out his bakkie, which is still stuck in a stream in the valley. After the floods, Premier Willies Mchunu announced that national government had declared the province a disaster area and would release funds. Municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said people must be patient while government is processing their requests. Gumede said he’ll refer Lembede’s request to Metro cops, who’ll assist Khumbulani with his car.
