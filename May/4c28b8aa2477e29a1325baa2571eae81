THERE was chaos and people ducked for cover while crossing the road. Bullets flew at Dumisani Makhaye Road near Siyanda, north of Durban, yesterday. Cops arrived in a white Quantum and allegedly fired rubber bullets, injuring several members of the Inkanyamba Business Forum affiliated to Isishingishane Business Forum. Construction workers were maintaining a tar road when the incident happened. Siphiwe Ngcobo from Inkanyamba said their members were sub-contracted to Sobhuza Investments, a private company, to work on the road project since March. When the project started, both parties brought road construction machinery to do the work and all was going well. Ngcobo said Sobhuza didn’t pay Inkanyamba for work done and left the site last month without an explanation. “Last month they spoke to the company owner and he promised he would come back and discuss their payments. “They’ve been waiting for their payments. “They also agreed that Sobhuza will not take machines until they get their payments.” He said about 10 cops arrived and fired rubber bullets. Daily Sun contacted company owner Bongani Gwala but he didn’t answer our calls or reply to SMSes sent to him. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that construction workers were at their site along Dumisani Makhaye Highway and said there was a dispute over pay.
