THE state has asked the court to dismiss former president Jacob Zuma’s bid to have his case struck off the roll. Prosecutor Wim Trengove told the Pietermaritzburg High Court it was wrong for Zuma to claim political interference in the case. Trengrove said there was nothing wrong with former NPA boss Bulelani Ngcuka discussing the case with Penuell Maduna, as Maduna was justice minister at the time. Trengrove said Zuma could not use former NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe’s decision to withdraw charges against him in his application as the decision was found to be unlawful in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Thousands of Zuma supporters are expected to be outside court today as he promised to address them.
