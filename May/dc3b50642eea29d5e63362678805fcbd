FOR the past two months, a 10-year-old girl has apparently been bleeding from her ears. This is because she was allegedly slapped on the head by her teacher in the classroom. The alleged assault happened at Reabilwe Primary School in Rebone kasi at Steiloop, Limpopo, in March. This was after the girl lost her natural science and technology textbooks. The child’s 33-year-old mum said she had not bled from her ears before, and the problem started immediately after the incident. “I went to the school immediately to report the matter to the principal, but the teacher was not there. “I took my child to Thabaleshoba Clinic and they referred us to George Masebe Hospital. “She was checked by a doctor but he said he didn’t see any injuries in either ear. “We went back to the hospital and they referred us to the provincial hospital for further check-ups.” The mum said after the teacher realised she was taking the matter to the department, she visited her at home and apologised. She said the teacher promised to assist financially. But she claimed the teacher later changed her mind and said her daughter was sick all along. “The teacher promised to pay for medical expenses, but now she has changed her mind,” said the mum. Education department spokesman Sam Makondo said the matter was being investigated.
