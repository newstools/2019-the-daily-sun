“IT HURTS to see other schools being built while we still wait.” These were the words of Mlamli Lubelu, the principal of Ndlumbini Junior Secondary School in Port St Johns. He told Daily Sun: “It’s been more than 15 years since we were told we were number five on the list of schools to get new buildings. “All we’re asking for is a new school. This one is old and the prefab classrooms leak when it rains.” Lubelu said the school’s toilets were old and dangerous but pupils were forced to use them. Nomzi Calubana (40) said she, her kids and her grandkids had attended the school. “The department is not taking villagers seriously. Maybe it’s because we aren’t protesting enough, like other areas.” Nomzi said there has been no improvement since the days when she attended the school. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said there was a massive backlog in the projects to rebuild and refurbish schools. “We’ve developed a plan to ensure that all schools in need of infrastructure are either serviced provincially or through other projects,” he said. He said some schools would be helped by the new presidential sanitation appropriate for education projects, which the school was enrolled in. Mtima assured residents the matter was receiving attention.
