A GANG of thugs is still on the run after bombing and stealing from a petrol station. The petrol station in Ximhungwe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was robbed of cash at about 2am yesterday morning. Hitler Twala, the petrol station manager, told the SunTeam he was asleep at home when he got a phone call from neighbouring shopkeepers. They told him heavily armed thugs had broken in. “When we got there, the thugs had already fled from the scene,” he said. “They knew the filling station closed at 11pm. They had time to blow up the teller’s window and go behind the counter. The blew up the safe and stole the money.” Calcutta police spokeswoman Sergeant Zanele Sibuyi confirmed the incident. She said a case of business burglary was opened. Anyone with information about the incident should contact Colonel Dudu Shabangu on 082 469 2569.
