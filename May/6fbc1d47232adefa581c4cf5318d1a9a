The new 'Brows on fleek' - feather brows. . . well not quite. Feather brows, also known as full brows, natural brows are a new beauty trend to give women a more natural makeup look. Feather brows are when ladies brush their brow hairs upwards and leave them that way. This brow look looks a lot more natural than the famous sleek 'brows on fleek' look, and because it's a more natural look, your entire face should be a more natural makeup look too with minimal eye shadow and neutral lip colours.
