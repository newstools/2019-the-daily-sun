HE was used to private jets, expensive holidays, designer clothes and luxury cars. And when he took his A-list friends out, Jabulani “Cashflow” Ngcobo spared no expense. However, since Tuesday Cashflow and his friend Mzabalaza Dlamini will have to get used to prison life. The Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Durban sentenced them to six years in prison for fraud. And their celeb friends have vanished. Somizi’s fiance Mohale Motaung, who’s one of Cashflow’s friends, said he didn’t know anything about it. “Will you please call after an hour so I can talk to you,” he told the SunTeam when approached for comment. Radio personality Sizwe Dhlomo said he had warned people on social media to be careful of trusting Forex traders. One of Cashflow’s close associates, businessman TT Mbha, said: “It would be unfair of me to comment because I also found out, like everyone else, from the news. I have lots of people calling me about money he took from them.” Cashflow’s social media accounts serve as a reminder of the lavish life he once enjoyed.
