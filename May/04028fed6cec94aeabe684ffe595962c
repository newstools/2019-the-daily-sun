JUB Jub’s new show Uyajola 9/9 on DStv’s Moja Love has provided entertainment on screen and social media. The show helps to bust cheaters. People on social media came up with funny memes since the show was aired on Sunday night. But many people on Twitter said the show was Jub Jub’s form of revenge for the jokes people made about him when he was in jail. Some people are even making plans to avoid Jub Jub and his crew. Joburg nightclub Taboo also got in on the fun. On Tuesday, the club tweeted that Jub Jub was banned from all their venues. They later deleted the post, but said people should rest assured they can club in peace. Solly Hlaka from the club said they didn’t allow cameras inside their venue. “Anyone who wants to bring a camera into the venue needs to organise with the club,” said Solly. An entertaining bit of Jub Jub’s show are the hectic show downs. Many people said they will tune in to watch these. But Lindiwe Mbonambi from the channel said they have plans to ensure things do not get out of hand. “There is security, which accompanies the crew on their shoots. We also have measures in place should the situation escalate even further.”
