STONES were apparently hurled as the cousins fought over their gogo’s house and wanted it to be sold. All hell broke loose when unknown men in a Quantum tried to demolish the house in Diepkloof, Soweto. The community fought with the men. Mapule Tsele (64) told Daily Sun the house belonged to her mum’s aunt, who had no children. “My sister and I took care of her until her dying days. My sister was given the house,” said Mapule. “They went to the deeds office to do a change of ownership and my sister became the official owner.” She was shocked to learn their cousins, who had no relationship with the gogo, felt they had rights to the house. “My sister doesn’t live in the house because she has her own just down the road. She asked our cousin to move in because he doesn’t have a house. “I don’t understand what they want from us. Why would they want to sell a house that doesn’t belong to them, especially when there’s a family member living there?” she asked. Mapule said unkown people broke the windows, walls and furniture. “We were lucky because a neighbour blew the whistle when he saw a Quantum drop men off who started breaking and throwing things out of the house. “My brother and niece were fortunately out buying food when the men came.” Chairman of community development in Joburg, Mzobanzi Ntuli, said: “Family houses are problematic, but if a person was given a house by the original owner and all the relevant paperwork is evident for this exchange, I see no reason for a fight. The only rightful owner of the house is the one with a title deed that has their name on it,” he said.
