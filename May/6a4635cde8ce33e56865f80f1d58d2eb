HAS Nissan just released the Darth Vader of bakkies? Joining Nissan’s Navara line-up is the daring Stealth derivative. According to Nissan, the Navara Stealth is modelled on the Navara luxury edition and it comes with a number of design updates to make it an even more rugged, redefined version. Standard silver and chrome detailing on the exterior gives way to sleek, black trims. What is more is that new orange accents on the grille and front bumper, side mirrors and side steps give the Navara Stealth an even edgier appearance. A roll-bar, side steps and black alloy wheels add to the Navara Stealth’s muscular look. This two-tone design is carried through into the interior, with seats featuring black leather side bolsters and orange material inserts and stitching. The Navara Stealth is available in two-wheel-drive and as a 4x4 featuring a 2,3 litre twin turbo engine with 140kW power and 450Nm torque, as well as a six-speed manual transmission or seven-speed automatic transmission. A snazzy standard feature includes Nissan’s Intelligent Around View Monitor. The standard on-board navigation system has 3D mapping with live traffic updates, USB connectivity, bluetooth audio streaming, and you can play an array of audio and video formats. The Nissan Navara Stealth prize ranges from R582 200 and comes with a comprehensive three-year/90 000km service plan, plus a six-year/150 000km warranty.
