MAHINDRA is strengthening its South African model offering with a game-changing compact SUV – its XUV300. The XUV300 isn’t only a stylish crossover but appears to have what it takes in terms of tech, spec and modern engine options to rival the Renault Captur, Mazda CX-3, Hyundai Kona and the much-anticipated VW T-Cross. According to Mahindra the XUV300, pronounced XUV three double O is a showcase of the rising Indian carmaker’s fresh thinking. The XUV300 is out to wow car buyers in South Africa, which Mahindra refers to as its “second home”. The newcomers lands here with both turbopetrol and diesel drivetrains and the choice of a W6 or W8 trim level.  With its dual LED-strip daytime running lights, aggressive grille, wide LED taillights and diamond cut alloy wheels, the muscular-looking XUV300 is definitely set to grab some attention. On the range-topping W8 model, the design is accentuated by LED indicators in the heated and folding side mirrors, dual tone roof rails, 17-inch wheels and silver front- and rear skid plates. On the engine front the new three-cylinder 1,2 litre turbo-petrol engine delivers 81 kW at 5 000 r/min and a healthy 200 Nm of torque between 2 000 r/min and 3 500 r/min.  The second engine option is a brand-new four-cylinder 1,5 litre turbo-diesel engine that delivers 86 kW at 3 750 r/min and 300 Nm in a flat band between 1 500 r/min and 2 500 r/min. All models for now are only available with six-speed manual transmission. The XUV300’s two trim levels both offer an impressive level of standard equipment and safety features. In W6 guise there are air niceties such as conditioning, electric windows, power steering, electrically adjustable side mirrors and central locking. For the W8 specification Mahindra ups the level of luxury with a multimedia touchscreen with Apple and Android functionality, a glass tilt-and-slide sunroof, cruise control, dual-zone climate control and keyless access.  Dual airbags and ABS brakes are standard across all models though the W8 derivative adds 5 more airbags – side, curtain and a driver knee airbag to the list totalling to a class-leading seven airbags. All versions of the XUV300 will be offered with a five-year / 150 000 km warranty and a standard five-year / 90 000 km service plan.
