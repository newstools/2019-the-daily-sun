 The EFF has
condemned the alleged African National Congress (ANC) members who are in an
organized camping to vote twice in different voting stations around the North
West. The EFF
said one ANC of the councilors was reportedly caught voting in two voting stations
in Marikana. “Ward 31
ward councilor John Molubi voted in Marikana High School and Marikana Community
Hall,” the EFF said in a statement. According
to the EFF, the people remove the ink that is put on the thumbs, then go and
vote in a different voting station. We call on
the IEC to tighten its systems to avert this madness of ANC thugs. “No one
must vote more than once. The principle is one person one vote.” The EFF
said it is not only illegal, but a direct assault on our democracy.
