AFTER stepping into her new house for the first time two weeks ago, she couldn’t stop her tears. Tholakele Ngema (43), from ward 10 in Maphumulo, KZN told Daily Sun for years she lived in a single rondavel in a terrible state. “A dog’s kennel was better than the rondavel I lived in. It was small, yet I had to do everything in it, including cooking and sleeping,” Tholakele said. When it began collapsing, she had to use blankets to cover the holes in the wall as she was couldn’t fix them. “I’ve had a paralysed arm for years so that made things worse, because I couldn’t mix mud to fix the rondavel and couldn’t pay anyone to do it for me. I’m unemployed,” she said. Maphumulo mayor Zibuyisile Khuzwayo-Dlamini said: “Her situation was raised in the ward. “It was brought to our attention and we started working on it. “It was a very serious situation that needed an urgent answer. “We’re happy the work has been finished and she can now sleep safely in a strong house.” On the same day, Human Settlements committee chairman Important Mkhize, Ilembe mayor Sduduzo Gumede and councillors officially launched the 2 000- unit Mkhonto rural housing project. Khuzwayo-Dlamini said: “This huge project spans wards 9 and 10 and the 2 000 units will benefit about 10 000 people.”
