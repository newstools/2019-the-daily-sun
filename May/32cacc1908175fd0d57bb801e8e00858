THIS will undoubtedly go down as one of the most dramatic Absa Premiership race ever! On a day of high drama and emotions, Mamelodi Sundowns sealed the contentious title race with a narrow 1-0 victory over Free State Stars, who, sadly, got relegated. At Orlando Stadium, Orlando Pirates thrashed Polokwane City 3-0. But still, the win was not enough. Even 10-0 was never going to win them the trophy. Pirates and Sundowns entered the dramatic final day neck-and-neck, with Sundowns, however, holding a two-point advantage. And it was the advantage that would ultimately prove the difference as the Tshwane giants retained their league trophy, pipping Bucs to the title with two points. But not since 2012, when Pirates snatched the title from under Moroka Swallowsâ€™ noses, had the league conclusion being quite so dramatic... on the field and in the boardroom, where it is still unclear what the arbitration process could reveal. But it will be a bitter one to swallow for Bucs, who bamboozled City with arguably their best performance in the league at home this season. Actually, they ended the match as a contest by half time as the dazed City players trudged off to the dressing-room, the Buccaneers looked like they wanted to skip the half-time break and just get this over and done with. Up in the suite, Jackson Mabokgwane kept one eye on developments at Goble Park where Sundowns led Free State Stars 1-0 by halftime. Granted, Downs had to contend with Caf Champions League interruptions but they still managed to win. Yet in truth, Pirates messed up plenty of opportunities and failed make hay while the sun was shining. They only won 15 matches, dropped the ball...worse than the IEC.
