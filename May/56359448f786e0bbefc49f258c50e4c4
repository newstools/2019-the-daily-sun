On Wednesday, the defence force supported Durban’s flood victims by donating mattresses, blankets, toiletries and clothes to the city. eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede welcomed the army delegates to Durban City Hall. Major-General Rudzani Maphwanya from the infantry unit said the army knows its duty is to protect the nation but it also cares about people’s well-being. “We couldn’t fold our arms and look away because people still need help to recover from that disaster. We wanted to assist where we could as a caring army.” Speaking on behalf of the city, Gumede said they were grateful for the donation. “The recent storm was devastating and many were left homeless, only with what they were wearing. We need help to reach out to victims. We managed to help some but building houses is a long process. “People are still staying in halls as they don’t have anywhere to go,” she said. Gumede called on more help as flood victims still face a long road to recovery and government couldn’t help everyone.
