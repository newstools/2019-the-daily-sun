AFTER winning his 12th trophy with Manchester City on Saturday, club captain Vincent Kompany has announced that he will be leaving the club. The Belgian, who has been at City for 11 years having joined in 2008, played his final game for the Citizens in their 6-0 thrashing of Watford in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Kompany played 360 times, scoring 20 goals for City. The 33-year-old won four Premier League titles, two FA Cups, four League Cups and two Community Shields with the Citizens. "As overwhelming as it is, the time has come for me to go,” Kompany said in a statement. “And what a season to bow out. I feel nothing but gratefulness. I am grateful to all those who supported me on a special journey, at a very special club. “I remember the first day, as clear as I see the last. I remember the boundless kindness I received from the people of Manchester. "I will never forget how all Man City supporters remained loyal to me in good times and especially bad times. Against the odds you have always backed me and inspired me to never give up. "Sheikh Mansour changed my life and that of all the City fans around the world, for that I am forever grateful. A blue nation has arisen and challenged the established order of things, I find that awesome."I cherish the counsel and leadership of a good human being, Khaldoon Al Mubarak. Man City could not be in better hands."
