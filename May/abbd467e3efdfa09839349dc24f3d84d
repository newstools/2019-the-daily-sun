Mvambi told Daily Sun: “Three people were critically injured, while eight sustained moderate injuries. Thirty-five passengers had minor injuries, while seven were declared dead at the accident scene.” Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the driver was found hanging from a tree. Makhele said: “The Intercape bus was travelling from Durban to Upington. There were about 53 passengers, including the assistant driver. It was about 3:30am when the bus lost control and overturned at a traffic circle on Alma Road. “It is suspected the bus driver lost control of the bus. Seven passengers, including two children, died. We have opened a case of culpable homicide and an inquest. At this stage we have not determined the ages of the victims.” Intercape spokeswoman Adre Zandberg said: “We are shocked and saddened by the accident. The driver was trained and appointed as a professional driver. He was familiar with that specific route.” “Intercape senior staff were dispatched to the area to assist authorities and medical staff. “The coach is in a roadworthy condition and a full certificate of fitness test was done on the coach two weeks before the accident. “Our deepest and most sincere condolences go to the families of the dead passengers.
