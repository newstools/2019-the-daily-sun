FOR months Ludalasi Clinic has been sending patients home with no medication. According to residents, the clinic in Mngazana in Port St Johns, which serves five villages, is in crisis. Ncebakazi Tshofele (37) told Daily Sun: “I have seizures but I’ve been sent home many times without medication as I was told there was none. “I’m waiting for my aunt to give me transport money to go to Isilimela Hospital as I can’t come back here.” Zimasa Ncoko (46) told the People’s Paper: “Even last year, we’d visit and be told to go back home as there was no medication. “We can’t really blame staff. It’s the department that’s failing to deliver pills. It looks like they only deliver to two or three villages.” Zilungile Madlavu (60) said it would be better if nurses announced which medicine they didn’t have before people spent hours waiting. “Waking up early in the morning while it’s still dark and returning without getting help is the most painful experience. You risk your life by walking in the dark,” he said. Zilungile said they wanted government to build another clinic. “This clinic is being run like a spaza shop. Our lives are not being taken seriously at all.” Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha advised patients to use the internal complaints system to raise their grievances. “There is a visible stock monitoring system where the department monitors stock at all primary healthcare facilities,” he said.
