D BN NYTS is back with another hit. Now with only three members, the kwaito group said they are fusing their sound with other elements to make it interesting. The group is made up of Wandile “Choco” Tshabalala (26), Cebo “Cebzin” Ngcobo (29) and Kabelo “Kaybee” Masenjane (25). They released their new single called Gqom User, which is produced by Symphonic and features Amosh. The song was released under their own record label, DBN NYTS Musiq. The song is inspired by the gqom sound and the way people dance to it. Kaybee said when a person is dancing to gqom, it’s as if something takes over their body. “There is no way you can stand still if you’re listening to gqom music. It’s one genre that makes you dance even if you didn’t intend to. People go wild,” said Kaybee. Cebo said this will be their first gqom song since Shumaya. Making the song was simple. He said they are known for being good at dancing, and this song will display their lifestyle. He said wherever they are, they want to make people dance and forget their troubles. “Our transition to gqom was simple because we are used to this genre. This is a bit of a surprise for our fans because they are used to us doing kwaito from our Shumaya days,” said Choco. The single is part of the album they released last year called Sextion 3, which they say is very musical. “We featured a lot of artists that have been part of our journey since we started at Kalawa. “We have grown musically and the album sounds the way we had planned. “This is the start of introducing a sound that people can appreciate throughout the year.” Cebo said they are busy on a tour for the single, and music lovers should check out their social media feed to take note of the dates for the tour.
