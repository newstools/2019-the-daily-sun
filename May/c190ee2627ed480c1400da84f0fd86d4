The SA under-20 national men’s team are on the brink of elimination from 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland. This after Amajita lost 1-0 to the Korea Republic at the Stadion Miejski in Tychy on Tuesday. Thabo Senong’s charges could not redeem themselves from the 5-2 defeat they suffered at the hands of Argentina in the opening match at the weekend. Amajita are now facing an uphill battle to qualify for the knockout stages, with a third place finish the highest they can attain. Amajita will be hoping to win their final group match to hopefully earn a spot in the knockout stages as one of the four best third-placed teams. They play Portugal at the Stadion Miejski Bielsko-Biala on Friday (8.30 SA Time) to conclude their group. The Portuguese will be looking to bounce back a 2-0 defeat suffered at the hands of Argentina earlier in the day. The South Americans are in pole position in Group F with six points from their two games.The Korea Republic are second on goal difference but equal on points with Portugal while Amajita are rooted to the bottom and are the only team yet to pick up a point. They started the match against Korea Republic on the front foot, determined to get an early break through. They were troubling the Asians, particularly on set pieces with the likes of Siphesihle Mkhize and Keenan Abrahams getting on the end of Leo Thethani’s set pieces. Abrahams was guilty of missing perhaps the best chance of the game for Amajita when he headed wide with the goal at his mercy. The second half was a totally different story with Korea Republic wrestling control of the match. Amajita were a shadow of the side that outplayed the Asians in the first stanza. They were ragged by their opponents and it was no surprise when they went a goal down after Kim Hyun-Woo headed in the opener in the 68 minute. That goal proved to be the winner with Amajita unable to get themselves back in the match.
