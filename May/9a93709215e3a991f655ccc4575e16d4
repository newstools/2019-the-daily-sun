ALL is not lost for the SA under 20 national men’s team despite getting their U-20 Fifa World Cup campaign off to the worst possible start in Poland. Amajita lost 5-2 to six-time champions Argentina at the Stadion Miejski in Tychy on Saturday in their tournament opener. Ezequiel Barco, Fausto Vera, Julian Alvarez and Adolfo Gaich were on the scoresheet for the Albicelestes while Keenan Philips and Lyle Foster got the consolation goals for Amajita. The South Americans, who are one of the hot favourites to win the tournament, sit at the top of Group F on goal difference ahead of Portugal who beat Korea Republic 1-0. Korea Republic and Amajita, are third and fourth respectively. Amajita coach Thabo Senong wants his charges to put the defeat to the Albicelestes behind them and focus on getting positive results in their two remaining matches. “It was not a good day for us, we were looking forward to a good performance, but you could see that we were playing against a very good team,” said Senong. “Tough luck to our boys, we just have to go back to training and look at the other games and help the boys to remain positive. There are still six points to fight for and the sooner we forget about this match the better.” Amajita play Korea Republic at the same venue tomorrow (8.30pm SA Time). The SA juniors are eyeing a top two finish to qualify for the knockout stages. Senong is optimistic about their chances and believes they can cause an upset in the remaining games. “We are playing Korea, they also lost their match and they will be coming hard at us. We have to remain positive, it is all about teaching the boys to come back from a bad result. Football has a lot of surprises and I still believe in our boys. “We are in a tough group, but now we have to plan for Korea and Portugal to try and steal points from those two because that’s the only way for us to stay in the tournament.”
