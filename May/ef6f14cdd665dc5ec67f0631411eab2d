Former
national traffic officer Rodney Ramusia will spend six years in jail for
corruption. The
Mokopane Magistrate Court sentenced Ramusia who was caught red handed with a cash
bribe of R200 in May last year. The two
officials had stopped a Hawks vehicle just outside Naboomspruit and demanded a
bribe in order not to issue a ticket. Unaware
that they were dealing with Hawks Serious Corruption Investigating members,
Ramusia and his colleague were arrested on the spot immediately after accepting
the bribe. “Ramusia
and his colleague were out on R1000 bail each,” HAWKS spokesperson Captain
Matimba Maluleke said. However,
during the trial charges against Ramusia’s colleague were withdrawn. Ramusia was
left alone to answer to his immoral efforts and on Monday he was slapped with a
direct six-year sentence for corruption with no option of a fine. The
Provincial Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Major
General Thobeka Jozi welcomed the sentencing. “We will
continue to support government zero tolerance stance to stamp out dishonesty
and unlawfulness. We would like to warn those who continue to steal from the
public that the long hand of the law will catch up with them. “The Hawks
will continue to clean government institutions as well the private sector and
restore a culture of integrity. We also call upon our citizens to be vigilant
at all times and report this illegal act that continually betray the public
trust," she concluded.
