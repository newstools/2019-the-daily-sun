ACCORDING to motorists in Lujecweni Village, bad roads keep damaging their cars. Mongezi Makhosonk (36) told Daily Sun they have to keep changing their tyres because of the roads in the village near Port St Johns. “It’s a joke. It’s unbelievable that there are still places like this in this day and age.” Mongezi said their councillor had not brought development to the area. “We blame him. We voted for him hoping he would bring change.” Villagers said when it rained, they were stuck because the bridge was flooded and rocks were swept onto the road. Another resident said there were also serious service delivery issues. “We are a forgotten community and it’s a shame that our leaders have abandoned us,” He said when they drove from Buzongoma, they were forced to drive at 20km/h. He said the councillor must do his job and stop wasting time. Councillor Zolile Maqhina said: “The recent heavy rain is the reason the road looks like this because as soon as it was fixed, the water damaged it.” He told Daily Sun those who said he didn’t bring development to the community were lying. “I won’t argue with them but those are lies because the road was fixed before and it will be fixed again.”
