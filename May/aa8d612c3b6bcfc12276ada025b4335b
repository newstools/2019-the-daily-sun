KAIZER Chiefs forward Khama Billiat wants to finish what has been a generally underwhelming season on a high. The Glamour Boys, by their lofty standards, have been rather disappointing this campaign. They have been rooted to seventh spot on the Absa Premiership standings with 38 points from 28 matches. Amakhosi are looking to secure a top eight finish as they head into their last two matches of the season. They lock horns with relegation threatened Free State Stars at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (3pm)  before wrapping up their season away at Chippa United on the final day. Billiat, who has netted 5 times in his 24 appearances in his first season at Naturena, wants to end the season strong. The former Mamelodi Sundowns star is ready to put this disappointing season behind him and go again next season. “It hasn’t been the season that we wanted, but we are fighters. We are playing for a big team and we will give everything until the last day,” said Billiat. “We made a lot of mistakes but we have learned from them, we just want to finish strong and start next season strong.” Despite Chiefs not being in the best of form, they may still finish the season with some silverware. They will contest the Nedbank Cup final against National First Division (NFD) outfit TS Galaxy at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on 18 May as they look to end their four season long trophy drought. Billiat, who won the Absa Premiership goal of the month accolade for March/April, will hope to bring his A-game against the Rockets.
