THE ANC in Durban wants a different police team to investigate the murder of Councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo. This comes after the three murder accused were discharged in the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Thursday. ANC Councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza and his cousins Phumlani Nojiyeza and Nkosinathi Mbambo were freed after the case was struck off the roll. ANC regional spokesman Nkosenhle Madlala asked the police minister to appoint a new team to investigate Maphumulo’s murder. He said the ANC suspected the team investigating the case was compromised. Maphumulo, a ward 88 councillor, was killed in October. On Thursday prosecutor Tiyani Mabaso said the state could not find witnesses in the case after they had changed their addresses. He said they were being threatened and were refusing to come forward. Maphumulo’s sister Phumzile (34) said the family was shocked and wanted the case to be reopened. Police ministry spokeswoman Reneilwe Serero said the investigating team had gone back to gather more evidence so the case could be brought back to court.
