THE Mabusela family from Tsunami in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, is mourning their brother’s death. Collen Mabusela (50) was allegedly killed by a neighbour on Saturday. According to the family, a neighbour called Collen over to his house after a funeral. They said when he got next door, his neighbour was being carried by two men. “Witnesses told Collen the neighbour had fainted, but my brother said it was just an act,” said his sister, Gloria (38). She claimed when the neighbour came round, he hit Collen on the head with a beer bottle. “He went home where he later died,” she said. “We heard he’s still out there. We’re not sure if he was arrested or not, but We live in fear that the man might also kill witnesses.” The family said they were shocked by what happened to their brother. They said they wanted the man to rot in jail. A resident said the suspect tried to kill himself on Monday. He said: “We found him in the bush, trying to hang himself, and called the police.” Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said the suspect was arrested and a murder docket has been opened.
