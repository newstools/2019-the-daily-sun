THE gogo lies on the ground, looking confused, cold, shaking. A video of a gogo handcuffed and tied to a bench at the Mamelodi Day Hospital shows the gogo’s daughter Stephanie Marais begging staff to let her mum go but nobody listens. Stephanie’s daughter Claudine Marais (31) said her gogo Martha Marais (76) from Eersterust Tshwane was referred to the hospital from Eersterust Clinic on Wednesday. She said they did not get any help for the entire day and in the morning her mum went home to collect some things. “When she and my grandmother’s caregiver came back they found my grandmother tied to a bench,” she said. “They had not fed, bathed, given her medication or a bed.” Claudine said her mother insisted they untie her gogo and a senior nurse apparently gave gogo Martha an injection. She said the staff claimed she had become violent. The DA’s Jack Bloom said he sent a complaint to professor Mac Lukhele, the head of Gauteng health. “I hope new health MEC Bandile Masuku intervenes urgently to fix the hospital,” said Bloom.Gauteng health spokesman Lesemang Matuka said they were appalled by the treatment of gogo Martha. “The hospital management is investigating this matter and those involved will be taken to task.” He said they will offer counselling to those affected.
