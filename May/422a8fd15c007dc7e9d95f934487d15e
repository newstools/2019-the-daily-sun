RESIDENTS of Pilgrim’s Rest have vowed not to vote in tomorrow’s election. Yesterday morning the angry community embarked on a service delivery protest. They called on Mpumalanga Public Works MEC Gillion Mashego to build them the RDP houses he allegedly promised them before they would vote. Thabo Moraba said Mashego visited the community last year and promised that the government would deliver all the services they needed, including housing. “We met him several times last year. He promised to build us houses and said the government had identified land where it would start building.” “He told us the project would start before this year’s election. But nothing has happened.” Thabo said the residents had been living in shacks for almost 10 years. “Why must we vote when we have not had water, proper houses or sanitation for more than 10 years? What is it that we must vote for?” he asked. Mpumalanga Public Works Department spokesman Cyril Dlamini confirmed that Mashego met the community but said he didn’t promise them houses. “There’s no way he could have made that commitment because that is the responsibility of the dpartment of human settlements,” he said.
