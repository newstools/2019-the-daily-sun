 THE HAWKS have issued warrants of arrest for the
Undercover Billionaires boss, Louis Tshakoana and his wife Komane Tshakoana. It’s alleged they were running an illegal multimillion-rand
investment scheme. According to Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo
Mulamu it is alleged that the Tshakoanas between 2014 and 2018 convinced
unsuspecting funders around the country to bankroll an alleged illegal
investment scheme known as Undercover Billionaires.  “Further investigations revealed that the family’s
company was not registered with the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA).
Investors were lured with promises of higher than normal returns on their
capital which they ultimately lost,” Mulamu said. Mulamu said the initial case of fraud was opened in
July 2017, against Louis Junior Tshakoana, who is the pair’s son.  “He subsequently handed himself over at the
Johannesburg Hawks’ offices in March 2018, in the company of his parents and an
attorney. “The matter was enrolled for court and Louis Junior
Tshakoana was granted a R70 000 bail, and the case was postponed to the 6th of
June 2019, pending further investigation,” Mulamu said. Mulamu added that further investigations have
implicated both his parents and when attempts were made to get them to account,
it became clear that they were escaping, hence warrants for their arrest were issued.  Mulamu urged anyone with information on their
whereabouts is to contact the investigating officers on the case, Captain
Hanyani Ngobeni on 071 481 3574 and Lieutenant Colonel Yolisa Sabela on 071 481
3612.
