NOMBULELO wants to die in her own house. But she still does not have an RDP house of her own, 22 years after applying for one. Nombulelo Gladile (60) of Protea extension 22 in Soweto said she applied for an RDP house in 1996 but has not yet been allocated one. “All the people who applied at the same time as I did already have their houses. Every time I inquire about my RDP, I’m told stories,” said Nombulelo. “I live with my child and I want to leave him a place he can call home. I don’t understand what I’ve done wrong.” Gauteng Department of Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza confirmed that the department had received an application from Nombulelo. “She has not received a housing subsidy. The department is aware of a number of people who applied in 1996 and who have not received houses yet. We advise her to go to her nearest human settlements regional office so she can be prioritised,” said Khoza.
