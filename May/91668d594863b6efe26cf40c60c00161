The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has joined the growing calls for Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to be recalled. In a statement released on Monday, the foundation said that Mkhwebane's findings released on Friday that Pravin Gordhan acted improperly regarding an early retirement payout for former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay were hasty and adverse. The Foundation's Executive Director Neeshan Balton said that the findings raise serious questions on the credibility of the process and the report itself. "The Public Protector was acting in a manner that came across as being “irrational” and “driven by an agenda that is clearly not about protecting the interests of the public," Balton said. Balton added "Her repeated blunders are eroding public trust in a constitutional body that is meant to protect citizens against state maladministration It also is becoming increasingly clear that some investigators in the Office of the Public Protector are an essential part of a factional agenda targeting selected public figures to discredit them. They too have to be weeded out," he said. The Foundation's calls joins many other organisations including COSATU, OUTA and COPE.
