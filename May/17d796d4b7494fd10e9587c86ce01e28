WHEN last did you look at your retirement plan? Some people have never gone back to it since drawing it up, while others don’t even have a copy. One big mistake many Mzansi people make is to think their monthly contributions towards retirement savings will be enough. Only a few people look at the performance of the funds they’ve invested in and whether or not the contributions are enough to get them to their retirement goals. FNB Wealth and Investments wealth manager Preenay Sathu said it’s vital to do regular reviews of your retirement plan to ensure it’s in line with long-term goals. “This will ensure you make the right adjustments should there be areas lagging behind.” Check your retirement plan: “Retirement planning is a long-term commitment that needs a lifetime of discipline for a financially healthy retirement,” Sathu said.
