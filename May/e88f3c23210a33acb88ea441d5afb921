A GRADE 8 pupil who stabbed his teacher to death for making him fail the year was sentenced to 12 years in prison on Monday. The 17-year-old from Manyeding Village in Mothibistad, Northern Cape, attacked English teacher Kingston Vhiya at the Bosele Middle School Hostel, near Kuruman last January. The teenager was found guilty of murder, assault, malicious damage to property and theft. NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said: “The court heard the pupil went to the school hostel after accusing Vhiya of making him fail grade 8 the previous year. “He broke the windows of the teacher’s room and Vhiya went out to talk to him. “The pupil apologised for his actions but when Vhiya turned to walk away, the pupil took out a knife and stabbed him in the back. “He also hit Zeky Mangei, who was with Vhiya, on the head with a stone and stole Vhiya’s cellphone before running away. “Vhiya was taken to hospital but died after he arrived.” State prosecutor Kenny Kgatwe argued for a heavy sentence, saying the pupil showed no remorse and lied to the court. Acting judge Vernon Smith sentenced the pupil to 12 years and declared him unfit to possess a firearm. Abrie Botha, provincial acting director of public prosecutions, praised investigating officer Constable Motsepe and Kgatwe for working hard to make sure the pupil was punished for his actions.
