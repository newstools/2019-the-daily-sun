MADALA Nicholas Hendricks (81) has been living in a shack for more than 30 years. His house in Ziteneni squatter camp in Butterworth, Eastern Cape, is built with wood, mud and zinc. It’s near a stream of sewage. “I’ve been living in the shack for many years,” he told Daily Sun. “How can I live like this while people talk about democracy? My shack leaks when it rains. I sometimes sleep with wet blankets.” He said he gets a social grant but it isn’t enough to buy building material. Nicholas said he has to walk about a kilometre to fetch water. “I use the pit toilet because I can’t get to the bushes. But there’s no more space and I don’t know what I’ll do when this pit toilet fills up. “We don’t have electricity and use wood to cook.” Human settlements spokeswoman Phiwokuhle Soga said the Mnquma Municipality submitted a list to the Mnquma destitute housing project. “We need the madala and his partner’s names and IDs. “The department’s destitute and vulnerable groups programme prioritises the elderly, child-headed families, disabled and military veterans.” Once we establish if they’re on the programme, we find ways to help.”
