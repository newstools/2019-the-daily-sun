Being on the Ellen Degeneres Show is considered as “making it” in Celebville! The fun show hosts celebrities and is watched worldwide! Trevor Noah is probably the only celebrity that hails from South Africa that has made it there. In a recent tweet, Pearl Thusi has joked that if she dies without stepping foot on the show, no one she leaves behind will make it to heaven. “If I die without being on Ellen DeGeneres' show. Non of you I leave behind will make it to heaven. Stru” Zinhle is a true friend, she affirmed to Pearl that she will make it, it is just a matter of time! And who doesn't want to see the so ever bubble personality on the show? Pearl was MC of the day at the Banyana Banyana send off and she ended her duties with a traditional Zulu dance! The actress is already recognized internationally and is truly a matter of time till she represents Mzansi on Ellen!
