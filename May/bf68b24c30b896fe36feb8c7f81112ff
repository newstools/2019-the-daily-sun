RESIDENTS of various kasis in Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands, brought everything to a standstill on Monday. They closed off entrances and exits in Imbali, France and Thornville with burning tyres, rubbish and stones, complaining about poor service delivery. One of the residents said: “We don’t see development in our area. We don’t have sports grounds, clinics are far away, public toilets are falling apart and are not cleaned and we need RDP houses.” Another resident said they wanted their voices to be heard. “We vote for politicians but when it’s time to deliver, they run.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that residents were protesting. She said a case of public violence was opened at Alexandra Road cop shop. Councillor Sibongile Mcwabo said: “I can’t say much because I’ve done my bit as a councillor. “I tabled all the demands of the residents to the municipality. It’s up to them to decide what to do.” Shop steward Nhlakanipho Mgabhi said while other district municipalities paid their employees about R15 000 a month, Zululand paid them less than R10 000. Umsunduzi municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha said they would wait for the residents’ petition before commenting. Zululand municipal officials couldn’t be reached for comment. At the municipal manager’s office, the person who answered the phone said the manager was not around. He asked for a contact number to respond but at the time of going to press had not done so.
