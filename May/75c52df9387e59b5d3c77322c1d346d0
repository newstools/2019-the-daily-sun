A FIGHT between two pupils ended in death. A source at Southview High School in Lenasia, south of Joburg, told Daily Sun a 15-year-old boy took out a knife and stabbed another pupil (16) on Monday. She said boys often fight over silly things. “But we don’t expect to see bodies at school. What we saw scared us,” she said. Parent Buyile Ndlovu (36) said they often hear bad stories about young boys at the school. “Something has gone wrong in our schools,” she said. In March a pupil was stabbed and killed outside Mondeor High School, allegedly by pupils from another school. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona urged schools to enforce the code of conduct to deal with bullying. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed the incident at Southview High School. But he said he could not comment further.
