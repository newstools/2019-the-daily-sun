BONGANI’S family was hoping for his safe return after he went missing two weeks ago. But the family of 29-year-old Bongani Kutumele is devastated now. His body was found near a graveyard in KwaMhlanga on Wednesday. Daily Sun published his story with the headline, “Help family find Bongani” on Tuesday. His uncle, Simon Mahlangu (44), said his nephew was hijacked by two men. He said a suspect confessed to the police that he was involved in hijacking and killing Bongani before throwing his body in the bush. Simon said Bongani’s body was in a bad state when it was found. Family members could only recognise him by the clothes he wore, and his fingers. “The family is struggling to come to terms with his death. Receiving a call to say a man’s body had been found in the graveyard made everyone uneasy,” said Simon. “We went there thinking it could not be him.We did not believe our eyes when we identified the body.” “The suspect said the two men took the VW Golf Bongani was driving and sold it in Venda. I wish they could have only taken the car and spared his life. “Now we are faced with the burden of burying my nephew, who had a very bright future ahead of him,” he said. Bongani’s mum, Josephina Mabhena (46), said she did not believe her son was no more. “I’m devastated and don’t know what to do. I feel as if a sharp knife has pierced through my heart. These thugs have robbed me of my son. He was a very good person,” she said. Police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said a suspect would appear in court soon.
