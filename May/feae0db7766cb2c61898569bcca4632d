CRICKET South Africa hosted a small braai over the weekend for the national team before the Cricket World Cup. The event was organised by celebrity chef Siba Mtongana. The aim was to give the team one last taste of South African food before they fly off to England for a month. The squad is due to leave Mzansi on Sunday with their opening match scheduled for 30 May against England. Chef Siba said she was excited and honoured to be feeding the team before they jetted off to make Mzansi proud. She said she hoped they would bring home the trophy. “When I was called and asked to cater for them I knew I had to do it. “Although it was short notice, all the preparations went well.” One of the players who attended the braai was fast bowler Lungi Ngidi. He said it was amazing to be representing South Africa at such a young age. The 23-year-old said he didn’t expect to be picked as one of the 15 players going to the World Cup. “I hope we make our country proud and win the competition,” he said. When asked what he thought of the food, he said it would be a great reminder of what they would be leaving behind at home. “Boerewors, chakalaka and pap are things I know I won’t be eating any time soon so I appreciated the great gesture,” he said.
