Macala is one of the hit songs that has got Mzansi singing along and Mlindo the Vocalist was never ready for the gospel version of the hit song. Taking to Instagram, Mlindo shared a video of an unidentified praise and worship group singing a Gospel version of the hit song at the pastor's request in church. The congregation went gaga as the typical church keyboard joined forces with singers who belted out the lyrics. All Mlindo could say was that he's ready for baptism which left most of his followers howling! He captioned the video "I’m getting baptised". Mlindo has gotten props and award nominations for his debut album Emakhaya and this hot collabo is one of the tracks that has received the most loved from fans. I’m getting baptized ????????????
