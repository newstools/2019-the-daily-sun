NOTHING inspires budding professionals like Bafana Bafana legends. Many dream of following in the footsteps of the people they grew up admiring, drawing on their inspiration as they seek to chart their own paths to stardom. For Ke Yona Team Search (KYTS) getting the Doctor Khumalo and Jerry Skhosana was a no-brainer.The two have enjoyed relative success in domestic football and are now helping unearth talent. Along with reknown coach Khabo Zondo, the two will be out Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday scouting for talented youngsters. The KYTS team has already been to the Eastern Cape and Limpopo province.“We have seen incredible talent over the previous try outs held in East London and Thohoyandou over the previous two weeks, and no doubt a wonderful headache to have in the technical team,” said Khumalo. “The talent will be equally as good in KwaZulu-Natal. I wish the youngsters all of the best for this coming Saturday. ”The gates open at 7am and the prospective stars are expected to swamp the place. The try outs are open to youngsters between the ages of 18 and 23 where this stage will be followed by a series of Boot Camps from where a final Nedbank Ke Yona team will be selected to play this year’s Nedbank Cup champions later this year. Still to come in the try outs is Galeshewe Stadium in Kimberley (26 May), Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium in Mangaung (26 May), Ikamva Training Complex in Cape Town (1 June) and Rand Stadium in Johannesburg (8 June). “We are delighted to have three respected figures in South African football leading KYTS this year,” said Nedbank’s Sponsorship Manager: Football Tutu Ntuli. “Nedbank is long-time investor in the future of football in South Africa and we are proud to bring star quality and decades of football experience and guidance to players.”
