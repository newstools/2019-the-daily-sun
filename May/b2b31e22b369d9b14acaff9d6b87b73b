RESIDENTS of Block 6 squatter camp, in Brown’s Farm near Philippi, say water has been flowing on their streets for the past three weeks. Residents said they reported the burst pipe to the municipality on several occasions. “People in overalls came and looked at the pipe but did nothing,” Masonwabe Mangena told Daily Sun. Masonwabe’s shack is next to the burst pipe. “After many days, other people would come yet leave the water flowing.” Other residents said their shoes get muddy at night. “We don’t have street lights and I often step into water ponds and muddy my shoes,” said Nokuzola Jeleni (41). Another resident, Wanda Bosman, said: “There are ponds down the road because of this pipe. “Clean water is being wasted and dam levels are getting low.” Another resident said: “The wet conditions may lead to a mosquito outbreak and other insects.” Said Mandla Siko (54): “The water gets mixed with rubbish. We need the municipality to fix this problem immediately.” The municipality said the burst pipe is on private property. Spokesman Jyothi Naidoo said: “The city’s investigation revealed that the defective pipe is on private property and will have to be attended to by a plumber.”
