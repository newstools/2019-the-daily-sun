SHE hears her son speaking from the grave. But when Meisie talks to anyone about this, people assume she is crazy. Her son Zein Johnson (30) died last month after being stabbed three times in the back. His mum Meisie (50) from Yeoville, Joburg, has been restless since. She said he tells her to exhume his body. “It’s not closure that I need, it’s my son. I need someone who will understand what I am going through.” Meisie said she was not sure whether this was a spiritual or ancestral problem, but said it needs to be fixed. “I need answers. I really feel my son was buried by mistake. This will haunt me if I don’t get answers,” said Meisie. She told Daily Sun before her son died, he told her he always had a nightmare of being in a coma and not getting any medication or help. “I wish I had paid more attention to him. He always told me about this bad dream, but I didn’t pay it attention.” Meisie said one of her friends once told her she had a similar dream and said Satanic people might be after her son. “I have never involved sangomas in my life, but in this case I am really desperate and need answers.” Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi, who said such things happen. He said sometimes a person simply can’t accept the fact that their loved one has died. “If she is not a believer, then she needs to accept that her son is gone. “If she feels like there is more to this issue then she needs to see a sangoma.”
