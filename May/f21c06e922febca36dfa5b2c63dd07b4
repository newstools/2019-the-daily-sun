VETERAN Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Willard Katsande says their eyes are firmly set on winning the Nedbank Cup. Chiefs tackle National First Division side TS Galaxy in the Ke Yona final at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (7pm). The tough as teak player says they will approach the match like business people to ensure they end Amakhosi’ four years trophy drought. Said Katsande: “We want to finish the business in 90 minutes, we don’t have time to go into extra time. There is no excuse, we need to remove the darkness of trophy drought by winning one so that we can open the gate for many more. God gave us an opportunity to play this cup final to redeem ourselves.” However, Katsande knows they will need to double their efforts to deny Dan Malesela’s coached side the chance to make history by becoming the first NFD side to win the trophy. He went on: “We know that it will be difficult. We are not even undermining TS Galaxy. We know they are a good team and can hurt us. We are working hard to try neutralise their strength to hurt them on their weakness. They can have possession and we can have results because our eyes are on the prize. The 33-year-old says they will need to up their game to give Amakhosi fans something to cheer about having failed to qualify for the MTN8 Cup. “They are kids and are excited to be in a cup final, they will try to make all millions in South Africa happy by knocking the ball around, but we will go for business which is results, the most important thing we need. "We need to sweat, run more in order to achieve our goal.”
