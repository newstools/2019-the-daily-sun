A PARENT from Nqabara Village, Willowvale, is angry with Butterworth Hospital. He accused the hospital of providing poor service. He complained after six pupils were rushed to the hospital after being involved in a car crash. The kids from Nqabara High School were going back home after a music competition at Willowvale Hall on Friday. The crash happened at about midnight when the driver of the Toyota Quantum they were travelling in lost control of the vehicle. The parent said the kids arrived at the hospital at 3am on Saturday morning but were only helped at noon. “The service at the hospital is very bad. Children were in pain while we were waiting,” said the parent. “We called Mbhashe mayor Samkelo Janda so he could talk to the hospital management. “The pupils were helped after Janda spoke to the hospital CEO.” Lwandile Sicwetsha, a spokesman for the Eastern Cape Health Department, said: “It’s not poor service. At the hospital, priority is given to patients who need immediate care. “In an accident, people with serious injuries are treated first. If the injuries are not serious, people are attended to just like everybody else.” The pupils were discharged the same day after being treated for minor injuries.
