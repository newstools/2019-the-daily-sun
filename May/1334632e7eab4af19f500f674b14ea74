Cape Town City midfielder Teko Modise will be retiring as a professional footballer when the season ends this weekend. He's considered one of the best midfielders the PSL has ever seen, the man known as "General" had an emotional message which was posted by his club Cape Town City on Twitter page on Friday morning.  Modise joined the City last season after a successful spell with Mamelodi Sundowns, where he won two Absa Premiership titles, the CAF Champions League and Super Cup, as well as the Telkom Knockout and Nedbank Cup. Early this year with The Citizens under the guidance of coach Benni McCarthy, Modise won MTN8, which means he has won all the trophies on offer in the PSL, to go with the success on the continent with Sundowns.Modise also donned the jerseys of Orlando Pirates and SuperSport United. He played at the 2009 FIFA Confederation Cup, 2010 World Cup as well as in the Africa Cup of Nations.“Going to training today was different, even though I use the same route that I take everyday. When I got there I didn’t know whether to laugh, to smile or to cry. I’ve always wanted to be a professional footballer. It was the only place where I was happy,” Modise said.“Growing up and getting recognised, I wanted to be Doctor Khumalo of this era. I knew that one day this day would come and I actually say, proudly so, that I have achieved everything that I wanted to achieve as a footballer. I just hope that a couple years from now somebody else will be sitting right here and being able to say that they got inspired by my career.“Modise will stay on with City in a different role.
