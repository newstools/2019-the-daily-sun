A video of a Durban motorist who managed to prevent two
armed men from hijacking an Audi A3 has surfaced on social media. In the video, the red Audi A3 can bee seen on CCTV parked on a
driveway, while a blue VW Tiguan pulls up behind the Audi. After the Tiguan stops, two armed men get out of the suv and
point their guns at the driver and they seem to be demanding the driver to open
the doors. The Audi driver quickly reversed, nearly crashing into the
Tiguan before they escape the scene of the incident. The incident reportedly happened on Musgrave Road in Durban
KwaZulu Natal.
