THE Proteas will jet out to the Cricket World Cup in the UK this week, with less expectation but hope of success. Coach Ottis Gibson feels his team is on the verge of “something special” in a tournament which has brought nothing but heartbreak to many South Africans over the years. The Proteas have battled to exorcise their World Cup demons and often carry that unwanted chokers’ tag into every major tournament. But Gibson insists the current crop will do something that’s never been done. “We try not to focus on the baggage, but to leave it in the bin,” says Gibson. “We’ve spent a lot of time visualising the journey in front of us, what it looks like and what it’s going to be like in the World Cup. Not too many players on this journey have the baggage from the past.” South Africa face hosts England, the current world number team in the ODIs, in their opening match on 30 May in London. But that is not of great concern to Gibson. “I try not to focus on England for now,” he says. “Yes, they are playing great cricket and will be at home. “But you don’t have to be number one to win. We are not number one or favourites, but we are very confident that we can win. “At the end of the day it’s still cricket. We played SriLanka, Pakistan and Australia. That was sort of packaged as a World Cup. “So now we going to play all those team in England and it’s called the World Cup.”
