VILLAGERS were happy when tarring of their streets was started in 2017. Now the people of Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo, are worried about phase two of the project. This is because the more than 6km gravel road is damaging their cars. Villagers blame the Greater Letaba Municipality for not maintaining the road. They say the road’s condition affects them badly. Sidwell Ngobeni (40) said: “It takes time to get to Moshate section from Marotholong, where the tar ends. “The other gravel road is at section C. Motorists are forced to drive slowly because the road is very bad. The situation is even worse when it’s raining.” Another villager, Thabo Letlotlo (33), said: “You can’t drive your car here for the whole month and not repair it. “We know the municipality has graders and we want them to help us because that’s what they were bought for. The road must be maintained at all times.” Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Maenetje said phase two of the Sekgopo Moshate gravel road was not budgeted for this year. “The villagers should raise the matter during the infrastructure development planning public participation process. “But we’re preparing to start gravelling the Mogano section again. “We will then grade the road as a temporary measure.”
