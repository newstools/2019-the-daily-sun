Black Leopards striker Mwape Musonda was on Thursday been named as the Absa Premiership Player of the Month for March/April with Orlando Pirates head coach Milutin Sredojevic claiming the Coach of the Month award. It is the second time that both the Serbian-born coach and the Zambian forward have picked up the coveted monthly individual awards during the 2018/19 Absa Premiership campaign. The Buccaneers played six matches during the period of March 1-24 April, as Sredojevic guided them to four wins and two draws, collecting 14 points out of a possible 18. Musonda, the in-form Black Leopards forward scored a hat-trick in his side’s come-from-behind victory over Chippa United and then also scored in three successive matches during the March/April period. He has largely been superb in front of goal despite his side’s inconsistent run of results, scoring six goals in Leopard's four games during this time. Thanks to his efforts, Black Leopards sit just above the relegation zone with only a couple of matches left to play until the end of the Absa Premiership 2018/2019 campaign. Musonda, who was the top goal scorer in the National First Division last season, has opened a huge gap atop the Absa Premiership top scorers' chart with 14 goals to his name. Sredojevic and Musonda will each receive R5 000. Meanwhile, Kaizer Chiefs' Khama Biliat took home the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award for March. The Zimbabwean attacker scored a scintillating goal from 25-yards to equalise for Amakhosi in their 1-1 draw against SuperSport United in early March. He also takes home R5 000 for his effort.
