THESE teenage newlyweds made headlines last year when they started wedding preparations. The lovebirds finally got married on Saturday. But the young bride will have to look for a school near her husband’s home. Thando (15) and Siyacela Dlamuka (16) from Ulundi, northern KZN, told Daily Sun they were happy their special day had finally happened. Siyacela said: “I’m very excited we finally got married. It is something we have always wanted from the first day of our relationship. “I’m happy Thando is now my wife.” He still maintained they would take things slowly. “We do not plan to have kids yet. All we are focusing on is finishing school,” said Siyacela. Thando said the past few days in her new home were amazing. “The entire family is warm and welcoming. They are treating me like their child. I’m happy and look forward to my new life.” Siyacela’s dad Mthandeni Dlamuka said: “The wedding went extremely well.
