RESIDENTS of Pretoria West are angry with Pastor Veronica Montwedi. They claim the house Montwedi was renting for homeless people was being used as a brothel and a drug den. But the pastor denied the claims. She said the house was a shelter for recovering drug addicts who used to live on the street. Tim Mashile, a member of Concerned Residents of Tshwane West, said: “Pastor Montwedi left the addicts unattended and they were up to no good. When we went to the house it was dirty. “There were condoms and syringes all over the place. What kind of shelter is that? “We want these people to go because we don’t feel safe when they are round.” Montwedi said the residents chased the addicts away because they wanted to hijack the house. She said she had been renting the house for more than four years but she was having financial problems. “I asked the owner to give us time to raise money and he agreed,” said Montwedi. “But now residents claim the house is a brothel.” Montwedi said the condoms were there to teach addicts about the importance of safe sex. “People don’t just stop smoking drugs, it’s a process. That’s why the syringes are also there,” said Montwedi.
