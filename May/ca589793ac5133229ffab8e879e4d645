HIS friend asked him to look after his cap and his R12 pocket money, and David Methape (16) agreed. But David, a grade 8 pupil at Robert Machaka Secondary School in Ga-Mamabolo Village, Limpopo, was ambushed and stabbed in the chest with a knife. This apparently happened on the school premises on Tuesday after David refused to give a fellow pupil the things. He was rushed to a nearby clinic in his teacher’s vehicle but was certified dead on arrival. The victim’s uncle, Charles Sithole (67) said he was home when a police van arrived and told him something bad had happened. Charles went to the clinic to identify the body. “I could see inside a huge wound next to his heart,” said Charles. “My nephew died in pain because there was lot of blood.” He said David wanted to be a dancing teacher after finishing school. His aunt, Monica Sithole, (60) asked for help to bury David. “It is going to be difficult for us to bury our son. Only one person is working. “We are pleading for financial help to arrange his funeral,” she said. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, spokesman for the Limpopo police, said the suspect fled on foot and was arrested at his hideout in the village. “The suspect led us to a spot where the murder weapon was hidden,” Ngoepe said. Sam Makondo of the Limpopo Education Department said a team of social workers was sent to the school to offer psychological support to pupils and teacher.,” The suspect will appear before the Mankweng Magistrates Court soon on a charge of murder.
