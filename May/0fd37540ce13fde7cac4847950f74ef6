IT’S business as usual today at the car wash after taxi boss Menzi Simelane (28) and car wash worker Bheki Mthethwa (30) were gunned down on Monday. The car wash in KwaMashu G section, north of Durban, had to be closed after the shooting. Simelane, who lived in Hammarsdale, had left his car and his clothes to be washed. He was ambushed as he was coming back to the car wash. Mthethwa was caught in the crossfire as he was giving Simelane his car keys. According to a source, Simelane had survived many attacks last year. “He had guards. But they weren’t with him on Monday. His death is related to taxi violence. “Taxi bosses didn’t like him because he was young and had many taxis.” Car wash owner Wiseman Cele said: “Bheki was hit and fell while Menzi jumped over the fence. “They followed him and finished him off in the bushes behind the fence.” He said Mthethwa had worked at the car wash for four years and was from Port Shepstone. Ntuzuma A and B chairman Thandolwakhe Mchunu said Simelane had taxis at different places around Durban. “We’re not sure why he was killed. We are waiting for cops to investigate,” he said. A woman believed to be Simelane’s relative refused to speak to the SunTeam. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two counts of murder were opened at KwaMashu Police Station after two men were shot and killed at a car wash.
