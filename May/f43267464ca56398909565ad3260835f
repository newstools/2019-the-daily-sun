ORLANDO Pirates mentor Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic is hoping their setback against Cape Town City over the weekend will not prove too damaging to their title chances. The Serbian tactician watched his charges drop points at a crucial stage of the season following their 2-2 draw against a determined City outfit at Athlone Stadium on Saturday. The result meant that the title is no longer in Bucs hands as they could be toppled should rivals Mamelodi Sundowns win their catch up match against Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (7.30)pm. Pirates are still at the top of the standings with 54 points with a game to go, Downs though, are breathing down their necks a point adrift with a game in hand. “We wanted to win, for the badge, for the jersey and for the supporters but it was not meant to be,” said Micho. “It is a setback, it’s disappointing that we didn’t win. Now our focus is on the last match against Polokwane, we want to continue where we have left off in this match, which is all out attack. “The players are fully aware that we need to focus on the last match with the intentions to win it and see where we end up.” Bucs are hoping to pip the Tshwane giants to the title this year after falling short last season. Micho is still hopeful that Bucs will clinch their first league title in seven years. They play Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium on Saturday in a must-win-match. “Mathematics is very simple science, we have 54 points, and we can get a maximum of 57. Our only concern now is to get to 57 points, whether that will be enough to make us champions, we will only know after that,” added Micho.
