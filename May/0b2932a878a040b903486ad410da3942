THE DA in the Eastern Cape is offering a R50 000 reward for any information about posters being damaged. This was after posters were ripped off poles in the province. DA provincial chairman Andrew Whitfield said party posters were being removed by criminals. “Last month, we were informed of an EFF activist allegedly removing our posters and burning them in Quzini, King Williams Town. He was later arrested by police and appeared in court,” said Whitfield. He said because of the attack on the posters, they were offering the reward for information that led to the successful prosecution of an offender. “The IEC made it clear that according to the electoral code of conduct, defacing political posters is a serious offence,” he said. “If any person is found guilty of committing such a crime, they can face a fine or imprisonment of up to 10 years.” He asked residents who witnessed people interfering or removing posters to let the DA know at report@da.org.za.
