STEVENS Mokgalapa’s days as Tshwane mayor may be numbered. Only three months after taking over the position, there are calls for him to make way for an EFF candidate. EFF leader Julius Malema has claimed the party and the DA have discussed making changes to their co-operation arrangements in running the metro. Malema said although the EFF won’t push for a vote of no confidence in Mokgakapa, it would move to have its own representative elected to the post. “We are sharing power in Joburg and Tshwane. So how are we going to do it? “Let’s do it in a manner that is not going to be disruptive.” He said if the DA refused, the EFF would explore other options. The DA confirmed discussions about the mayor’s position were in progress. But Mokgalapa won’t be unemployed if he were to be replaced. Mokgalapa is on the list of DA members that are heading to parliament.
