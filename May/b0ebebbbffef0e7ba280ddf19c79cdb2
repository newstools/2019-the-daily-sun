SOME parents are still ashamed of their kids living with disabilities. They lock them up, stopping them from playing with other kids or from being seen in public. But Grannie Maake (22) from Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo is not like that. And she’s not ashamed of her 7-year-old daughter Hlogi. Hlogi was born with a developmental disorder. She can’t walk, talk or move. Grannie realised Hlogi was physically challenged when she was five months. Grannie told the Peoples Paper that she is not ashamed of her child. “Everywhere I go, I go with her. She is my pride and joy and a gift from God,” she said. Realising some parents were ashamed of their physically or mentally challenged kids, she decided to start a support group. “Parents must be proud of their kids living with disability because they didn’t choose to be born this way. “I plan to go door-to-door and encourage parents to stop locking them indoors. They must let them go outside and feel the fresh air.”
