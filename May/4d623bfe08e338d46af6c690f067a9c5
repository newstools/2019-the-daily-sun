THESE gogos said they have no money and can’t offer sex to councillors in exchange for RDPs . That’s why, they claim, they’re still waiting for houses up to this day – 15 years after they applied. Nosandla Madubela (61) is one of the residents of Browns Farm in Phillippi, Cape Town, who has accused councillors of demanding money or sexual favours before they can provided with RDPs. She accused younger women who had applied for houses much later than them of jumping the queue by offering sex. Gogo Melissa Manqindi (62) said: “I moved to block 6 in 1996. We were promised houses back then, but we’re still living in shacks.” Nontomzana Vellen (63) claimed some councillors had asked women to sleep with them if they couldn’t bribe them. “We don’t do those things. That’s why we don’t have houses while younger people have been helped,” she said. City of Cape Town human settlements MMC Malusi Booi could not confirm or deny the claims. “We will need complainants to provide the city with information and evidence so the allegations can be investigated.”
