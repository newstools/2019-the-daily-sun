MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says Absa Premiership Top Goal scorer Mwape Musonda should stick with Black Leopards to avoid disappointment. After being rewarded for his scoring ability that helped Lidoda Duvha retain their PSL status, Musonda hinted that he wants to join a big club like Kaizer Chiefs. The Zambian international scored 16 goals to walk away with R25 000 prize money at the PSL awards ceremony held in Durban on Sunday. Said Mosimane: “Musonda has done well. He is the top scorer of the team and helped them survive relegation. The guy had the team on his shoulders, he is a good player. I hope he stays where he is because Black Leopards needs him.” The Coach of the Year warned that the 28-year-old could make a big mistake of his career if he moves on from the Venda based side. Added Mosimane: “But I am not the right one to decide whether he stays or go. He knows that he has traveled a little bit to find a stable home. You can leave a club you are good at and appreciated, move somewhere and nothing happens. So be very careful of moving when you are being loved and people want to keep you.”
