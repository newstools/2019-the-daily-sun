A 33-YEAR-OLD woman thought her dream had come true when she married the love of her life in February last year. But her dream turned into a nightmare when her husband couldn’t perform in bed. She was told to poke her babezala for traditional reasons. “It’s tradition. I just had to get over myself and be groomed,” said the woman from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. She told Daily Sun about her first night with her husband. “When we got to bed my husband’s 4-5 wouldn’t get up,” she said. She thought he was tired, so they went to sleep. But they failed to have sex all the time. She said she bought the best lingerie to get him excited, but nothing worked. The woman suggested her husband sleep with two other women to see if the problem was only with her. The poking was normal. Then she tried to sleep with another man, but that wasn’t successful. The couple consulted a sangoma, who told them her babezala had used muthi to make any man’s 4-5 fall asleep when he tried to poke her. She said when they spoke to the babezala he said they will get it fixed but it was complicated. The husband saidhe couldn’t understand why the person who raised him for 39 years would do this. The husband (39) said: “I need to get this fixed. I don’t want to cheat on my wife.” The babezala said he used muthi because he didn’t want his daughter-in-law to cheat on his son. “I didn’t know it would make my own son fail in bed. “We will try and get this fixed,” said the babezala.
