THE Proteas have taken the first step in their Netball World Cup campaign as Norma Plummer assembled 21 of his 29-women team in Pretoria to begin preparation for the trip to England in July. Plummer and her team held a meeting before starting the training at St Mary’s Diocesan School for Girls yesterday. However, they did so without eight players, who are currently playing in the world’s three best netball leagues – the Suncorp Super Netball League in Australia, the New Zealand’s ANZ Premiership and the Vitality Netball Super league in England. “We leave South Africa on 28 June and have four days preparation before the two Test matches on 4 and 5 July,” explained Plummer. “We’ll leave Wales for Liverpool on 6 July, and will continue our preparations for our first match at the World Cup on 12 July against Trinidad and Tobago. “The eight players competing in Australia (Karla Pretorius, Phumza Maweni, Ine-Mari Venter, New Zealand (Lenize Potgieter) and England (Bongiwe Msomi, Shadine van der Merwe, Maryka Holtzhausen, Sigi Burger) will obviously not be able to take part in the camp. But we will work with the rest of the squad, preparing for the World Cup.” Part of Plummer’s preparation plan includes an intensive training camp and pre-World Cup Tests against Wales in Cardiff, though the international commitments means the whole team would not be able to get together until their arrival in Wales. South Africa will be among the 16 teams vying for honours at the 15th edition of the premier competition in international netball. In Plummer, the Proteas have a coach with tons of experience. The Aussie has coached the Australian Diamonds to two World Cup gold medals. The Proteas will move camp to the Rembrandt Hall at the Tuks Sport Centre for the last two days. The final team will be presented to the International Netball Federation 24 May.
