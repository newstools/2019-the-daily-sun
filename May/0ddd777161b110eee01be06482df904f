NEDBANK Cup champions TS Galaxy have confirmed the passing of one of their most promising midfielders. Ke Yona Team search graduate, Thembinkosi Mbamba, who featured in the Nedbank Cup final last weekend against Kaizer Chiefs, is said to have been involved in a car accident. He was part of the 2016 Nedbank Cup Ke Yona team search and had a short trial with SuperSport United, before he ended up with TS Galaxy in the National First Division (NFD) this past season. In a short statement on their Twitter account, TS Galaxy wrote: “A sad morning for the TS Galaxy family as we woke up to the sad news of Thembinkosi Mbamba’s passing. “Last week we were celebrating with him, today we mourn him. Our sincere condolences to his family during this difficult period. Sleep well young Rocket.”
