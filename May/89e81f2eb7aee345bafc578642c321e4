EFF leader Julius Malema told residents not to vote for the Better Residents Association, calling it a useless party. Malema said this on Wednesday at Thulamahashe Stadium in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. Addressing his followers, Malema said people should vote for the EFF, the only party that will abolish tenders, double social grants, provide quality, spacious houses, and expropriate land without compensation. “Burning tyres won’t bring you service delivery,” said Malema. “People of Bushbuckridge, I’m warning you, make up your mind. “Go and vote for the EFF. We will bring you more change Don’t waste time, voting for the regionalist BRA, because it is based locally and useless, and won’t take you anywhere. “You’ve been suffering for too long without water and jobs, and your fertile land was taken by whites.” Malema said after the elections the EFF will bring all these back to the communities. He said the EFF fights for unity, and not division, tribalism, nepotism or sex for jobs. Malema told the crowd: “Jacob Zuma, Nomvula Mokonyane, Bathabile Dlamini and President Cyril Ramaphosa and his deputy David Mabuza must go to jail for stealing your money, and for Marikana.” He said all those who stole from the people should face jail term and pay for their sins.
