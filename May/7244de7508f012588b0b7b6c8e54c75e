HE HAD just collected his bakkie after its service when the brakes failed and it overturned. The incident slowed down morning traffic in Bloemfontein yesterday morning. When Daily Sun arrived at the scene near the Free State Psychiatric Complex, Dikeletso Solfafa (32) said he was the driver. “I had just picked my bakkie up from getting serviced. “When I approached the traffic lights, the brakes did not work. When I put my foot on the brake pedal, there was no resistance,” he said. “I had to use the hand brake while trying to avoid hitting other cars and pedestrians.” Dikeletso said the bakkie swerved over the two lanes and ended up overturning. “I’m relieved no one was badly injured but I’m shocked this happened to a car that had just been serviced.” He said he was with a colleague when he crashed. “We were on our way to work. I’m glad he wasn’t hurt. The bakkie has been towed away and I will be heading to Parkweg cop shop to make the accident report,” he said. Motorist Thabo Lesemelo said the two were very lucky they were not harmed. “This shows that miracles do happen. Innocent people could have been injured in this crash,” he said. Parkweg police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said Dikeletso had filed an accident report.
