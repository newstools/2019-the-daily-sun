LITTLE Mbalenhle Mafuno (5) has been missing for almost two weeks. She was last seen playing with friends. When her mum Gloria went out to look for her, she was nowhere to be found. Worried residents of Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, have been looking for her. This is the second child that has disappeared in the area since the beginning of last month. Two weeks ago, residents of Tsakane marched to the police station to demand that cops search for Amahle Mbatha (8), who was kidnapped by a stranger not far from her home. Amahle is still missing. “We have to stop our children from playing because we fear they’ll be taken. But we don’t want them to stop playing either,” said a parent. “We want the people who’re doing this to be brought to book and to stop targeting our children.” Residents told Daily Sun the time has come to start praying for our country and kids. “We hope prayers will cast out the evil spirits that are in the country. We can’t afford to live in fear because of heartless individuals. We suspect they are doing this for money,” said a resident. “We pray that both kids will be found.” Captain Nomsa Sekele confirmed a missing person’s case was opened at Benoni Police Station.
