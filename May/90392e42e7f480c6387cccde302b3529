International Boxing Organisation (IBO) welterweight champion Thulani “Tulz” Mbenge’s preparations for his title defense against Sebastian Formella in July have received a major boost after the Mdantsane-born boxer won the Male Boxer of the Year award at the South African Boxing Awards ceremony held at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg on Saturday. Mbenge got the nod ahead of equally talented boxers like current International Boxing Federation (IBF) Intercontinental junior-lightweight champion Azinga Fuzile, IBO cruiserweight king Kevin Lerena, African Boxing Union (ABU) bantamweight belt holder Ronald Malindi and World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Intercontinental junior-bantamweight champion Yanga Sigqibo, who were also nominated for the Male Boxer of the Year. The unbeaten Mbenge, who is a former South African welterweight champion, got the nod following his victories over Diego Cruz and Diego Gabriel Chaves last year. On the other hand, SA female bantamweight queen Melissa Miller bagged the Female Boxer of the Year gong in a category she competed with World Boxing Federation (WBF) female bantamweight champion Bukiwe Nonina and Thema Zuma; while veteran fight referee and judge Siya Vabaza-Booi won the Female Ring Official of the Year award beating other nominees Namhla Tyhuluba and Pumeza Zinakile. Meanwhile, veteran IBF flyweight champion Moruti Mthalane, WBO bantamweight belt holder Zolani Tete, Hekkie Budler, who won the IBF, World Boxing Association (WBA) and Ring Magazine junior-flyweight belts in one night in May last year, as well as Xaba Boxing Promotions boss Ayanda Matiti were honoured with the Recognition for Excellence Awards. Boxing South Africa (BSA) gave Lifetime Achievement awards to Gladys Tsenene, Mzoli Madyaka and Themba Zulu (both posthumously), as well as Les Andreasen and Jeff Ellis.
