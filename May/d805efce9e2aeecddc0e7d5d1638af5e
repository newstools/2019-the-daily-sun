RESIDENTS of Maclear in the Eastern Cape have asked that more cops be sent to their area to fight crime. The small town, as well as surrounding Matatiele and Elliot, are stock theft hot spots. An imbizo was held at Somerville Village on Tuesday after the CPF recovered stolen sheep in a forest last week. Safety MEC Weziwe Tikana and police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga listened to residents’ frustrations. “Stock theft in this area is giving us sleepless nights,” said CPF member Mbuyiseli Khwani. “We report the matter to cops, but they take time to reach our area or sometimes don’t come.” Mziwenkosi Magadla from Sidaka Village said cops had a hand in their troubles. “When we go to cops with our complaints about land issues, they tell us they don’t have charges for that,” he said. Ntshinga assured the villagers she didn’t take the meeting lightly. “I’ve heard the complaints,” she told the worried villagers. “We’ve introduced traditional policing to help fight crime.  We can’t build police stations in every village. “I’ll add your request for a police station to the list of villages that need one. “Maybe it will be built after 10 years.”
