South African sport stars, not just from the athletics world, have taken to social media to rally behind Olympic 800m champion Caster Semenya after she lost her appeal against the IAAF. On Wednesday, Semenya lost her court challenge, which saw the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) judges, by a 2-1 majority dismiss Semenya's appeal against the measures imposed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) that compel "hyperandrogenic" athletes - or those with "differences of sexual development" (DSD) - to artificially lower their testosterone levels. The decision by CAS means going forward with immediate effect, women with elevated testosterone will have to take suppressive treatment if they wish to compete against women in certain events. Semenya and her legal team have 30 days to appeal the decision and they are understood to be considering their options currently. Her outcry following the CAS' decision was enormous as thousands took to social media to express their shock and disappointment in the IAAF and the ruling. South African athlete and former IAAF World Championships medallist Anaso Jobodwana was vocal on Twitter, calling the IAAF "useless". Meanwhile, banned former Proteas opener Alviro Petersen shared his thoughts on Twitter, commenting that "what is legal isn't always fair" and wished Semenya well on our tough road ahead. -Sport24
