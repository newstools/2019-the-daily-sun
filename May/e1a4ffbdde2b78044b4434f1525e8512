Afrikaans singer Steve Hofmeyr, who destroyed his DStv decoder and satellite dish in an attempt to boycott MultiChoice, has urged his supporters to do the same. This comes after MultiChoice in a statement to Channel24 said that it would "in future not carry content that includes Steve Hofmeyr on any of its platforms". The statement came after the South African company last month threatened to withdraw its sponsorship of the Ghoema Music Awards if Steve Hofmeyr's song, Die Land (The Land), wasn't immediately removed from the list of nominees. In the act of rebellion, Steve shared a video on Facebook of himself driving over his DStv decoder, and throwing the satellite dish of his roof. He then offered an R10k reward to "one lucky winner" who did the same and posted a video on Facebook before 1 June 2019.Supporters of Steve have come up with creative ways to destroy their decoders, including roasting it on an open flame!
