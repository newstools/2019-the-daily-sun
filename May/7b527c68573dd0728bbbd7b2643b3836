DAVID Mokaila had to deal with the pain of losing his six-year-old son twice! The 48-year-old from Soshanguve, Tshwane, had the shock of his life when his son’s grave vanished from Block L Cemetery. David said weeks after burying his son, he visited his grave but the spot where his beloved son was buried was empty. He said the next day he and his brother went back and found his son’s name on another grave. He said he called the cemetery caretaker and funeral parlour but they didn’t help him. David said didn’t know what to do. Broodie Funeral Parlour told Daily Sun they didn’t know anything about David’s son. Senior manager Morongwa Broodie advised him to visit their offices. “After we bury someone, the grave is no longer our problem. But we’ll help him find his son’s grave.” City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the person dealing with cemeteries in Tshwane will help. “We advise him to go to our offices in Mabopane or Soshanguve for the matter to be investigated.”
