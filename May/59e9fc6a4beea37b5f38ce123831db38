ETHEKWINI mayor Zandile Gumede was granted R50 000
bail when she appeared in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Tuesday. The mayor appeared in
court for corruption-related charges. She handed herself
over earlier on Tuesday to gether with regional deputy secretary Mondli Mthembu. News24 reports that Gumede hasÂ  been accused of using her political position
to influence a Durban Solid Waste (DSW) contract that had no ceiling on the
amount of illegal dumping. There was a previous ceiling of R5m. 

 Another official allegedly facilitated for four
service providers to win the refuse collection contract for three months,
valued at R45m with an unlimited budget for illegal dumping. In addition, she and Mthembu are accused of
manipulating various legal and supply chain processes to ensure that the four
service providers manipulated the tender system.    "If they are
found to have been violated, bail will be revoked and you will be in custody
for the remainder of the matter."
