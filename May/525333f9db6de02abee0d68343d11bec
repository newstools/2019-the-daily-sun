ACCEPT and love your autistic child. This is the message for parents struggling to live with children living with autism. Parents and children took to the streets of Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape to raise awareness about the disorder on Thursday. Gogo Xoliswa Dlambule (79) said at first it was difficult to live with her 12-year-old niece, Inako, who was abandoned by her mother. “When Inako first came to me in 2013, I could tell she was different. “She struggled to do things other children did.“She couldn’t say when she needed to relieve herself. “I took her to doctors and now she’s doing really well and can say when she wants something,” said Xoliswa. “I urge parents to love and accept their children. That’s what they need.” The gogo said had to deal with the child although her health wasn’t good either. “But over time I learnt and managed to understand her,” said gogo. Thembisa Special School principal Mzimasi Magqabi said dealing with the children was a bit difficult because their challenge is that they and not so difficult at the same time.“What makes it difficult is that don’t have trained people to help. “The classes should accommodate eight pupils but we have bigger classes because of the huge need,” he said. Mzimasi said it would be great if they could have a school for autistic pupils in the region. Dr Esethu Mntonintshi, a paediatric doctor, said their goal is for everyone to understand the condition. “That is why we are doing the march,” she said.
