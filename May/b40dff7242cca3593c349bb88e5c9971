MPUMALANGA unbeaten prospect Arnel “The Hope” Lubisi believes he is the future face of boxing in his home province. Lubusi comes from a boxing family. His father, Abram, is a former SA bantamweight contender. Lubusi was scheduled to meet fellow rising star Richardo Malajika on Friday at Emperors Palace. Their six round non title bout was pulled-out of the bill after Malajika was involved in a car accident and their eagerly anticipated clash has been postponed for 8 June. The 19-year-old fighter said he was ready to cross swords with the former six time SA amateur champ. “It is unfortunate that my opponent got injured. I was looking forward to locking horns with him,” he said. “The accident delayed our chance to finally meet. Since our days in the unpaid ranks we were eager to fight each other, but we never had a chance. “I wish Malajika a speedy recovery so that we can be done with this. I also hope he will bring his A-Game because his fateful injury gave me more time to prepare,” said Lubisi. Lubisi said he carries the hopes of his home province on his shoulders. “In my family we never had champions, so I’m that hope. In our province, we don’t have a world champion, so I will be the one,” said the ambitious fighter. Both young fighters – Lubisi and Malajika – are seen as the future of South African boxing with a great amateur pedigree. Lubisi’s father and trainer said despite the outcome between the rising stars, they have potential to be crowned champion in the future. “Malajika and my son both have a great future ahead of them. Whoever loses when they clash has a good chance to be a champion. I’m happy that they will finally get the opportunity to fight. They always wanted to fight each other since amateur ranks,” said Abram. Malajika and Lubisi are still to taste the defeat after three fights in the professional ranks.
