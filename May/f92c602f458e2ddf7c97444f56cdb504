WHEN it’s hot outside, the house is cool inside and when it’s cold outside, it’s warm inside. This is the special RDP house handed over to gogo Elizabeth Mutileni (77) last Wednesday. The house was built by the National Home Builders Registration Council, a body that protects consumers from poor workmanship. It was handed to gogo Elizabeth, from Digwale near Siyabuswa, by MP Grace Tseke and Mpumalanga Human Settlements MEC Norah Mahlangu. Gogo Elizabeth had been waiting for a house for a long time. On Wednesday she could not hide her delight when she was given the keys to her house. She is the first person to be given this type of a house. No bricks were used to build it. Instead, a special mixture of concrete and steel was used to regulate the temperature during heat and cold. Vusi Hartley of the builders’ council said the house used little electricity and the toilet did not need water. He said it was built in such a way to save electricity. “The system used to build the house has been approved by Agri-SA. We are going to build 10 houses in Dr JS Moroka and Thembisile Hani municipalities,” he said. Gogo Elizabeth said: “I registered for a house a long time ago, while my husband was still alive. “I’m very happy that at last I have the house that I have been longing for. My husband died and left me in a shack. I wish he was still alive to share the joy of living in a proper house with me.” Mahlangu said her department had a duty to restore people’s dignity by giving them proper houses.
