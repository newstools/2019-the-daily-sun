 THE DESPERATE mum was beginning to fear the worst.Her two-year-old daughter had been missing for two days.THEN THE CHILD WAS FOUND. COLD, TIRED, HUNGRY AND THIRSTY – BUT ALIVE! Now the people of Mooiplaas squatter camp in Tshwane are calling toddler Shamaine Mpini a miracle child. This is after she went missing while playing on the street near her home on Saturday and miraculously survived two cold nights in the veld without any food or water. Her mum, Placxedes Zimunhu (30) was reunited with Sharmaine on Monday. Holding her baby in her arms, the relieved woman said she believed God saved her child from jackals, animals in the veld and evil people who may have harmed her. The child was found by a sniffer dog in tall grass after cops from various units spent the weekend searching for her. Placxedes said she couldn’t sleep or eat. “I just spent the weekend crying,” she told Daily Sun. “I’m a Christian and I prayed. I consulted a prophet while my family consulted somebody else.” Placxedes said all the prophet told her was that her child was alive and she would see her again. She said police believe Sharmaine walked 3km into the veld near the squatter camp. The child was taken to a local hospital and there were no signs that she had been abused or injured. Sharmaine’s uncle Langton Zimunhu (28) said: “We didn’t think we would see her alive again. We are very grateful.” CPF chairman Jasper Masukata (51) said mums must be very careful about leaving their children unattended. “Watch out for your kids. If you can, you should put them in a creche,” said Jasper. Police spokesman Tumisang Moloto said: “Police were very happy and relieved when they could reunite the child and her mum.”
