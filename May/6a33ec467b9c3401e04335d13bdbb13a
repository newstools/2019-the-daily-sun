SOCIAL Development deputy minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu launched an economic plan for women on Monday. The event took place at Ga-Masemola Village, outside Polokwane in Limpopo. The framework aims to help Sassa grant recipients by exposing them to job opportunities and self-development. Bogopane-Zulu told Daily Sun she hopes women will try not to be solely dependent on the grant for their livelihoods by becoming self-reliant. “Our department has a social protection mandate to ensure the poor and vulnerable do not fall below the poverty line and are not excluded from social and economic opportunities,” said the deputy minister. The highest number of beneficiaries of social protection programmes are women. “Our women in rural areas still need development to better their lives,” she said. A Stats SA survey done in 2016 found women made up 51% of the county’s population.
