TITLE chasing Mamelodi Sundowns have a great chance to lay one hand on the Absa Premiership trophy when they entertain Golden Arrows at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday evening (7.30pm). With Orlando Pirates dropping two points against Cape Town City in Saturday's 2-2 draw, if Sundowns win their game-in-hand against Arrows they will go two points clear with one match left to play. There is plenty of motivation for the visitors as coach Steve Komphela's team can move into the top eight with a victory - a goal that Abafana Bes'thende have been pursuing in the final few weeks of the campaign. Sundowns come into the contest on the back of an exit from the CAF Champions League following a defeat to Wydad Casablanca in the semi-finals. Therefore, with the PSL crown being their last chance of silverware in 2018/19 - coach Pitso Mosimane's will not be lacking for enthusiasm. Mosimane said his team were taking nothing for granted, saying: "I heard from the supporters that Pirates had drawn. "But do we have a guarantee to win on Tuesday? I don't like to get excited too quickly. "Anything is possible on Tuesday. You can't celebrate, you must win first. A game in hand is not a game won.
