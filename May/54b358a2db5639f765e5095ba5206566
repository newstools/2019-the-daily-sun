EFF leader Julius Malema promised that the EFF will enter parliament doing the vosho dance at a press briefing last week. And he has delivered on this promise. Today, members of the EFF are being sworn in at Parliament in Cape Town. When Julius Malema's time to be sworn in came, he led with a vosho dance. Several other videos show members of the EFF practicing and doing a vosho dance outside parliament.
