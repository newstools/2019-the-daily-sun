BUSHBUCKRIDGE municipal council member Mphikelele Malomane (43), Bongani Sibuyi (27) and Palesa Maja (23) face charges of theft and fraud. The Hawks bust them on Friday. Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said they scammed candidates who applied for a leadership skills programme organised by Bushbuckridge Municipality. The municipality invited youths to attend a leadership course in August 2017. Apparently, candidates had to pay a fee of R250 each into an FNB account and about 351 candidates deposited the cash. The Ultimate Training Programme was allegedly appointed to run the project, with Sibuyi as project leader. The students apparently signed forms to receive stipends for five months. Two months after classes started, students and facilitators werenâ€™t getting their allowances and the next month, the three disappeared. The Hawks said the programme owner was told the project had been cancelled. The account into which the fees were deposited actually belonged to Umphile Thuto Consultant, registered to Maja, with links to Sibuyi. Malomane allegedly organised the entire programme. On Friday, the three were given R3 000 bail each by Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court. Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said Malomane was still performing his daily duties.
