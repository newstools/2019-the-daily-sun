The EFF says it rejects all calls for Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to be removed from her job simply because she has found against Pravin Gordhan. The EFF said NGO’s such as the Kathrada Foundation, Freedom Under Law, Outa as well as Cosatu and SACP have called for the removal of the Public Protector. “We reject the calls as a direct attack on a Chapter 9 institution. “They are also reactionary and steeped in the politics of a personality cult as they portray Gordan above the law,” said EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. Ndlozi said the EFF has instructed its lawyers to join in the legal defence of the public protector’s review against Gordhan. It is clear that this office is under attack from the Thuma Mina faction, and it must be defended by all constitution-loving South Africans.” “It is important to underscore that the decisions of the public protector are legally binding until they are set aside by a court of law. Simply filing papers for a review does not set aside the decision. ’We reiterate that Ramaphosa must not reappoint Gordhan to his cabinet,” Ndlozi.
