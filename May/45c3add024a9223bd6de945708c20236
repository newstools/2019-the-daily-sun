FOUR suspected fraudsters were caught trying to defraud a business account of
R12 million in Tubatse Crossing Mall.  Hawks
spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said following a tipoff, the Hawks'
Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team ambushed the suspects inside the
bank.  Maluleke said it is alleged that the plot was for the consultant to make an
immediate transfer of a substantial amount into the suspect's several accounts. â€œThis was to be repeated on a weekly basis
until the said account was drained and for her efforts the consultant was
reportedly promised a significant amount of money per transaction. "The consultant willingly played along after having alerted the manager
and the suspects were arrested whilst still submitting their account details,"
Maluleke said. All four are expected to appear at the Praktiseer Magistrate Court on Friday to
face charges of fraud. Meanwhile this incident marks the second time the same bank was embattled in a
similar incident. Last year, between July and August suspects were arrested by the Hawks after
they allegedly attempted to defraud over R100 million from Royal Bafokeng Trust
account in the same branch.
