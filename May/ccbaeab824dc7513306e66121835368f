MAMELODI Sundowns Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) coach, who doubles up as SA Under-23 coach David Notoane, says they will spoil their fans with a double prize this weekend. While their senior club, under the tutelge of coach Pitso Mosimane, are on the verge of winning the PSL title tomorrow, Notoane aims to lift the 2018-19 Multichoice Diski Shield cup on Sunday. The stage is set for the second final of the Diski Shield since its inception last season. Downs, who were last season’s Diski Shield runners-up, vowed to fight this time around to win it when they visit Golden Arrows in the final at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday (1pm). Notoane said: “Our first team is on the verge of winning the league tomorrow, and we should wrap up a perfect weekend for Sundowns fans on Sunday by winning the Shield title. “The ideal double was for the first team to win Caf Champions League and Absa Premiership title, but now we will complete that double with the Diski Shield title.” “Last season we came close and now we need to go a step further. We must win this for our academy because the culture of the club is to win something every season.” Sundowns will be without midfielder Promise Mkhuma and Malebogo Modise, who are on national duty with the SA Under-20 team preparing for the Fifa World Cup in Poland. But Notoane said that is not a train smash as they have a potential replacement. He stated: “The competition in the team is healthy. We are not a one-man team. “There are still the likes of Thabang Sibanyoni and Vuyo Mantjie, who are capable of leading us to glory.” The champions will walk away with a R150 000 cheque, while the runners-up will get a consolation price of R75 000. The prize money will be donated towards a community initiative. Arrows will play for Bantuvakani Primary School in Lamontville, while Mamelodi Sundowns will play for Ribane Laka High School in Mamelodi.
