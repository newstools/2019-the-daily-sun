GAUTENG Premier David Makhura has committed to running a tight ship. He was speaking at the swearing in of new MECs yesterday. Presided over by Judge President Dunstan Mlambo, the ceremony was held at the Emoyeni Conference Centre in Parktown, Joburg. Praising his team of five men and five women, Makhura said he didn’t want to be caught off guard by corruption scandals. He said the stuff coming out of the Zondo Commission was toxic and he didn’t want any MECs caught in a mess. “We are the servants of the people and not celebrities. There are a lot of temptations when you are in these leadership positions,” said Makhura. Addressing complaints about Panyaza Lesufi being moved from the education department to finance and e-governance, he said: “I even asked myself if it was the right decision to move him. “Don’t be surprised if I change my mind and take him back to education. But Lesufi is the calibre of man I need to clean the finance department.” Makhura said they would target the economy to benefit townships. Speaking about the controversial issue of e-tolling, he said: “Urban tolling is unworkable. We will tackle e-tolls. They are not off my agenda.”
