MAJWEMASWEU is no longer only known for being Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s home. The kasi in Brandfort, Free State, is now famous for having dry taps. Despite this, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mathethwa visited the area last week to introduce a contractor who will upgrade the historic house. The SunTeam visited the site this week and was told by workers they should fill bottles of water to use the toilets and clean the yard. One worker said: “Most of the time, the taps are dry and we can’t even use the toilets.” Another worker said: “Our municipality is rotten to the core. They can’t even maintain the water system. I’m working hard to save cash to move out of this municipality.” Resident Thabang Moine (37) said he has lost hope the ANC would ever fix the water problem. “I’m not sure if I will vote for them next week,” he said. At the time of going to print, Masilonyana municipal spokesman Zongezile Ntjwabule had not responded to questions and his phone rang unanswered. DA leader George Michalakis said: “Not everyone in Brandfort can afford to buy water, and the ANC doesn’t acknowledge it is a basic need for the whole community.”
