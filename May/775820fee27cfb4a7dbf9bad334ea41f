All SABC workers have been evacuated. This after some of the people were stuck on the 17th floor. Johannesburg Emergency Services' spokesperson Robert
Mulaudzi said there was diesel spillage on the 15th-floor standby
generator. Mulaudzi confirmed that were no injuries reported and all
people were evacuated. Vuyo Mthembu, the SABC's spokesperson said there was a power
outage on Wednesday morning which resulted in the SABC's internal systems
switching from City Power to a back-up generator. "Due to the ageing and failure of the equipment, this
led to the diesel tank overflowing," Mthembu said in a statement. "The health and safety of SABC employees is of
paramount importance and, as a precautionary measure, all our employees from
the Radio Park building have been safely evacuated," Mthembu said.
