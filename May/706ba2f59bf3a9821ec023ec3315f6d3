THE shack dwellers had to either sleep in the open or move in with neighbours after their homes were demolished. Residents of Daytona Riverside Village in Lamontville, south of Durban, told Daily Sun about 24 shacks were demolished by the land invasion unit on Sunday. Fifty people were left without shelter. Sibongile Phakade (28) was forced to sleep at his brother’s house. He said he was not at home when the cops came and destroyed his shack and building material. “I got a call warning me our shacks were being demolished,” said Sibongile. He rushed back, only to discover the cops had already started demolishing other shacks. “My brother helped me and we moved my belongings to his house.” Adam Ngqantswane (30) said what the cops did to them was painful. “Most of us don’t have proper jobs. We do piece work. “We don’t have money lying around, waiting for times like these when our belongings and material get destroyed. “We don’t have the money to replace them.” Adam said they not given enough time to collect their belongings. “We’ve been living here since 2002. We don’t know why they came here now,” he said. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela promised to respond but had not done so at the time of going to print.
