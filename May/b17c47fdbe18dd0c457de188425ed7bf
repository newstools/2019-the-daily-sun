WHEN vehicles are hijacked, thugs usually want them for spare parts or to use in other crimes. But in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, they apparently steal cars to get home! Police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw said: “We presume they come here to party and when they have to go home, they hijack cars.” According to Rossouw, most hijacked vehicles are found in neighbouring kasis such as Thokoza, Zonkiziwe and Katlehong. He said they are found undamaged. The cops said most of the thugs’ victims are people who park on the side of the road to sit with their girlfriends. The thugs pounce while they are chilling. He said they sometimes also target non-metered taxis. He said the thugs often get a woman to request a taxi and then hijack the driver when he arrives. “We arrested two men behind the hijacking of these taxis last month. “We are still looking for the woman working with them.” Rossouw said there have many hijackings on the N3 between Durban and Joburg. He said the victims are stopped by women who ask for a lift to Villiers in the Free State, where armed hijackers are waiting.
