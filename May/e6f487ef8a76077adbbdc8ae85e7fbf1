ANOTHER pupil has died in an accident at a train station. The death at Parow Station in Cape Town on Friday morning came just a month after 16-year-old Simo Kwepe was hit by a train at Woodstock Station. Commuters who spoke to Daily Sun after the incident blamed Metrorail’s poor management. A woman said: “The trains are never on time and people always get to work late. “That means whenever a train arrives after a long delay, everyone struggles to get on and such incidents happen.” Dalton Ndogeni, spokesman for commuters’ rights association Public Transport Voice, said commuters should always be careful. “You cannot board a train that’s in motion because it’s dangerous.” Ndogeni said Metrorail should have security guards controlling people’s movements, especially during peak hours. “On top of that, there should be awareness programmes at schools.” Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott confirmed that a 19-year-old fell under a train and died. “Every tragic incident should raise safety awareness among commuters. “Safety rules are promoted during awareness campaigns as guidance to prevent further tragedies,” she said. Police spokesman Siyabulela Malo said an inquest docket was opened. “Members of the Parow Police Station attended to the scene, where a witness told them the victim was late and tried to jump on to a moving train. “He fell and landed under the train,” Malo said.
