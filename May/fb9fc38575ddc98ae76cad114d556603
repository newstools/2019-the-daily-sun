Residents of Khwanyana in Port St Johns said they were tired of drinking the same water as dogs and goats. Luyanda Khwethana (45) said even though they were living in bad conditions, they still voted in the hope that things would change. “Communal taps were installed last year but they soon stopped working, sending us back to square one,” she said. The SunTeam walked with Nwabisa Madlisa to the river to fetch water. Pigs were in the veld on their way back from the river and the water was very dirty. “This is what we experience every day. We are fighting with animals and it has been like this for a very long time,” she said. “We use this water for drinking, cooking and washing. There is no water in the communal taps but we still voted because we hope the people we voted for will see this and do the right thing.” Councillor Zolile Maqhina blamed residents for the situation. He said they didn’t take care of the resources given to them. “Our people need to be honest and stop shifting the blame onto other people.” He said the communal taps were broken by thieves who stole parts, and diesel from the pumps. He said it was not the job of the municipality to protect the taps and pumps but that of the community.
