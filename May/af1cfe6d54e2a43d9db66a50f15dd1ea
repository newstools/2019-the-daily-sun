The EFF has rejected the cabinet as announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The EFF said it finds Ramaphosa as “a dishonest, manipulative person whose cabinet decision is an absolute insult to the intelligence of the country”. “The first sign of absolute dishonesty is the idea that he has reduced the cabinet by reducing the number of ministers, yet he increases deputy ministers. The point of the call for the reduction of the cabinet has always been about saving taxpayers money.  “This objective is not achieved when a number of deputy ministers has been considerably increased whilst reducing the cabinet,” said EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. The red berets said the cabinet remains a bloated bunch of people, which is a clear disregard of the public purse in favor of satisfying the factional demands of the ANC. It said Ramaphosa has failed to save public money from the factional and careerist gluttony of the ANC. “Putting more Deputy Ministers after reducing ministers and telling us that you have reduced cabinet is an insult to the intelligence of South Africans. “Secondly, the EFF rejects the cabinet for the rewarding of corrupt individuals like Pravin Gordhan who has been found guilty of maladministration and misconduct by the Public Protector. The re-appointment of Gordhan means Ramaphosa has no regard for the remedial action and reports of the Chapter 9 constitutional institution and decisions of the constitutional court. In fact, the appointment of Gordhan is irrational and clearly unconstitutional. “The balancing act in relation to gender is a positive development. However, it is far too short of young people of 35 years of age or younger. “We reject the cabinet and take it as a declaration of war and the EFF will respond decisively. Ramaphosa will be treated the same way as Zuma. Whoever ignores the findings of the Public Protector is an enemy of the EFF and a constitutional delinquent,” said Ndlozi.
