MOLELO wa badimo is a Tswana saying which means you have been burnt by ancestral fires that are not happy about something. This has been one of the most popular definitions of vitiligo in Mzansi. Vitiligo has long been misunderstood and people who live with the condition go to great lengths to try cover it up. Well-known South African actress Leleti Khumalo has admitted she used to apply make-up for hours to try and hide her vitiligo. But that’s no longer the case. There is increasing recognition and appreciation of the individuality and beauty it comes with. Reatile Moalusi’s latest exhibition, Molelo Wa Badimo, opened at Absa Gallery, in the Joburg CBD, on 5 May and will run until 14 June. It’s a three-part character portrait series: Complexion, Pigment and Hue. It explores and debunks myths around the condition and documents individuals’ life experiences using collaborative character portrait photography – all to raise awareness about vitiligo. “The exhibition also seeks to inspire a renewed dialogue about beauty by dispelling societal myths about vitiligo and focusing on identity and self-acceptance,” Reatile said. “Metaphorically, Molelo Wa Badimo illustrates a fusion of opposites white and black, an element of the new South Africa, the rainbow nation and the coexistence of opposites in one.” Part one of the exhibition, Complexion, was shot using large-format photography to highlight each individual’s character. Molelo Wa Badimo is a perfect example of Moalusi’s quest to use his artistic talent to bring awareness to a range of societal issues, inspired by Mzansi’s challenging the traditional ideals of beauty and identity. “This aligns with Absa Gallery’s commitment to showcasing the rich artistic talent Africa has and providing these artists with the platforms necessary to be bold and bring their possibilities to life,” says Thabo Seshoka, Associate Art Curator at Absa Gallery.
