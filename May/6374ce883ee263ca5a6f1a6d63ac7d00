BMW is getting ready to unveil its third-generation BMW 1-Series and
I know what you thinking, "We already have three generations of three
series." Well, you'd be forgiven for thinking that. But it's not true. The
F20 has been around since 2011, in car years that's a very long time. https://twitter.com/BMWGroup/status/1128944488238452736 BMW gave the current F20 a drastic facelift in 2015. That facelift
was so drastic it could be confused for a new model. But it was not, despite
the drastic changes to the exterior the car underneath remained more or less
the same. Now the third gen 1-Series is completely new. And when looking at
what the new BMW 1-Series is bringing it is understandable why BMW is taking
time its sweet time before unveiling this car. The third generation is ditching its unique longitudinal engine,
rear wheel drive set-up for a traditional transverse, front wheel drive set-up. Since its introduction 8 years ago what has made the BMW 1-series
special is unlike its rivals like the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, Audi A3 and the
Volkswagen Golf the 1-Series was a tyre shredding, rear wheel drive champion. With all that set to change BMW had to work really hard to ensure
that the new 1-Series remains special to drive even with the FWD set-up. Its rivals
have had time to perfect the FWD formula. But BMW has a trick up its sleeve. They've also had time to work
on the FWD, Minis, 2-Series Active Tourer and even the X1 share the same FWD
platform. And BMW is already working on a fast 1-Series. We've already seen
the M135i testing at the Nordschleife. This is because unlike the current top of the range BMW 1-Series.
The upcoming model topper will use a four-pot engine instead of the 6-pot. Same
set-up as found in the newly introduced X2 M35i. Its 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine produces 225kW and 450Nm
of torque. It uses an 8-Speed to send power to all wheels via xDrive. Can't
wait for the drag races between Audi S3 and Merc's A35 AMG and the M135i
xDrive. In the teaser posts, BMW has been posting on social media we see
that the upcoming model we see that the new car has a short snout, thanks to
the transverse set-up. https://twitter.com/BMW/status/1128943181507256320 The set up should also free up some needed rear leg room.
Something the old 1-Series always came short on. We see that the new 1 will
also get the same digital instrumentation introduced in the 8-Series.
