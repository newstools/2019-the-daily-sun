SOUTH Africans have come to expect regular increases in the petrol price. At the beginning of the month, the price rose to R16,48 a litre. According to the AA, motorists will have to prepare themselves for yet another price increase at the beginning of next month. The AA says the coming carbon tax is likely to add 9c a litre to the petrol price and 10c to the diesel price. The association is hoping the government will clarify its policies as these have a direct impact on fuel prices. The price of petrol has increased four times since the beginning of the year. There was only one fuel price decrease, in February.
