A ZAMA ZAMA lost both his legs when he apparently fell into a hole at City Deep mine in Joburg by accident. “Unfortunately at the time of his fall other zama zamas were digging with heavy machinery,” said ER24 spokesman Ross Campbell. He said because the other miner hadn’t seen him, he kept on digging with the heavy equipment. “The digger continued, amputating both legs, one below the knee and the other just above the knee.” “Paramedics and provincial services arrived on the scene at 10am, to find the man still in the hole.” Campbell said a scoop was used to take him out and then both his legs were bandaged. “The patient was taken straight to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital for emergency treatment.”
