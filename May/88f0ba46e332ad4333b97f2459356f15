VETERAN striker Siyabonga Nomvethe will wave goodbye to his beloved fans on Saturday (3pm) when AmaZulu host struggling Black Leopards in a penultimate Absa Premiership match at King Zwelithini Stadium. Cavin Johnson’s side will wrap up their campaign against Bloemfontein Celtic away on 11 May. For Nomvethe, in a career that has spanned 22 years, having made his professional debut in 1997 with the now defunct African Wanderers, this will be his last in front of Usuthu fans before he retires. The 41-year-old has scored 28 goals in 71 appearances since he joined the Durban-based side from Moroka Swallows in 2016. He will leave an impressive record in the PSL having scored a staggering 123 goals, 13 ahead of Mabhudi Khenyeza, who scored 110 before he took the assistant role at the club in January. Nomvethe was the last player to score 20 goals in the PSL in 2012. But Johnson has yet to decide whether Nomvethe will play or not. Said Johnson: “Nomvethe is in the 18-man squad. We know it is his last game at home. Maybe AmaZulu will look after him when he retires. That’s up to management.” Nomvethe, currently the oldest player in the PSL, made his name at Wanderers together with Phumlani Mkhize and Sibusiso Zuma. They converted 34 of 43 goals Abaqulusi  had between them in the 1997/98 season. When Zuma and Mkhize joined to Orlando Pirates, Nomvethe moved Kaizer Chiefs. He then played abroad for Udinese, Salernitana and Empoli in Italy. He also played for Swedish side Djurgadens and Danish side Aaiborg Bk. He also made a short stint at Pirates. Nomvethe scored 16 goals in 82 appearances for Bafana Bafana. Johnson revealed that the KwaZulu-Natal province should honour Nomvethe’s success. “We should honour Nomvethe. What he has in his head can be instilled into many players in the province,’’ concluded Johnson.
