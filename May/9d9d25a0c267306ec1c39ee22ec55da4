A MAN who murdered a student paramedic and raped his woman friend will spend the rest of his life in jail. Thabang Ngwekazi, a 28-year-old student at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth, was hijacked and kidnapped in 2016 before being shot. His body was dumped in the sea. His friend, a 21-year-old woman, was raped. The Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday sentenced Thulani Jusaya (20) to two life terms and 72 years in prion for murder, rape, kidnapping, robbery, assault and possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition. His co-accused was sentenced to a total of 39 years’ imprisonment for murder, kidnapping and robbery. Judge Elna Revelas said: “Neither accused showed true remorse for involvement in the crime and only asked forgiveness at the conclusion of the case. “Accused number one (Jusaya’s co-accused) pleaded not guilty but asked for forgiveness. “Jusaya shifted blame and claimed he was acting under the influence of another accused. Your actions left a scar on the family of the dead.”
