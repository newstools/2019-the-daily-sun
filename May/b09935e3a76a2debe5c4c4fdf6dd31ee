COPS in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, have warned pupils to be careful. They said rapists had been targeting schoolgirls in the area and they knew of two victims. The latest victim (15) was abducted on her way home from Lefa-Ifa Secondary School last Friday. Constable Media Khoza said the girl was walking along Joe Mzamane Street when she was approached by a red car with three men in it. “One got out and asked her for directions,” he said. “She said she didn’t know the area and one of the men took out a knife. He told her to get into the vehicle. “They drove off with her to an open field behind Masimini Primary School, where the three took turns raping her. After the incident they drove off.” Last Sunday an 11-year-old waiting for transport was approached by an unknown man. He forced her into his vehicle and took her to an open field in the Rest In Peace area, where he repeatedly raped her. Khoza said both victims were given counselling and medical attention. Cops were working hard to find the suspects. “We urge children be vigilant at all times and not to talk to strangers. They must report any suspicious vehicles or people,” he said. “Residents are encouraged to work with police to bring these perpetrators to book. “Anyone with information is asked to call 08600 10111, 011 812 4600 or 071 675 7010/13/14/19.
