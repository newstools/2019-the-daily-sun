WHEN cops asked him why he was parked next to the road in the middle of the night, he said his bakkie had a flat tyre. But he couldn’t explain the eight 25-litre cans of fuel under the canopy. Captain Gerda Swart told Daily Sun police in Humansdorp, Eastern Cape, arrested a 40-year-old municipal worker for possession of suspected stolen diesel. “The suspect was arrested in the early hours of Saturday morning near the fire department in Bosbok Street. “Police were patrolling in the industrial area when they spotted the man in his vehicle, parked on the roadside. “The officers questioned the driver, who told them the vehicle had a flat tyre and that he worked for the fire department.” Swart said cops found containers with diesel in the man’s white Hyundai. He couldn’t say why they were there. “There were a number of cases where diesel was stolen from trucks at the fire department. It’s believed the recovered diesel is worth R3 300.” He was due to appear in the Humansdorp Magistrates Court today on possession of suspected stolen goods.
