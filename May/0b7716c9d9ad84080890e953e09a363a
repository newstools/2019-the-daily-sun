KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middedndorp was left bitterly disappointed after his side failed to make the top 8. Amakhosi’s woeful season ended with a 1-0 defeat to Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday. The Glamour Boys finished the 2018/2019 Absa Premiership season outside the top 8 in ninth position on the Absa Premiership log, with 39 points from 30 games. The last time Chiefs failed to make the top 8 was back in the 2006/07 season under Middendorp who was sacked at the end of the season. The German, though, can’t take all the blame this time as he arrived near the back end of the season to attempt to clean up former coach Giovanni Solinas’ mess. Nevertheless, the former Maritzburg United mentor was disappointed not to have secured a top 8 finish, at the least. “It’s absolutely a huge disappointment not to be in the top eight, not being part of the MTN8 at the beginning of the season, theres no doubt about it,” Middendorp told SuperSport TV after the game. “We dominated but we didn’t score and now we are standing here out of the top eight. In the end certain circumstances you can’t influence.” Chiefs have become a laughing stock this season with social media pulling no punches. Their lengthy stay in seventh spot on the standings throughout the season, saw them dubbed 7 De Laan. However, after they fell to ninth, they got a new nickname, Hectic Nine9. Amakhosi will now look forward to the Nedbank Cup final against TS Galaxy on Saturday as they attempt to redeem their season, if possible. “It’s good to have a small target in front of us that’s the Nedbank Cup, if we will be capable to make this competition ours then it will be a little better but we are still disappointed,” added Middendorp.
