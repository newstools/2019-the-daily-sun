PAULOS Motloi (40) was at a tavern watching Kaizer Chiefs losing to Chippa United when a fight broke out over R10. It left him with a badly ripped ear. Some people he knew wanted to borrow R10 from him but because he didn’t have change, he gave them a R100 note. Instead of bringing back R90, they gave him R80 and that led to a fight. He was attacked with a beer bottle. Paulos, from Caleb Motshabi kasi, Mangaung told Daily Sun: “I was at the tavern hoping Kaizer Chiefs would be in the Top 8 competition when a friend asked me for R10.” But then the young man didn’t bring his change. “I asked him for my money but he gave me R80. I asked him for my R10 and one of his friends klapped me.” In the fight that then broke out Paulos managed to defend himself but later, at another tavern, he felt a bang on his head. “The same group had followed me and hit me with a beer bottle on my right ear,” he said. “They are cowards, attacking me from behind. But I know who they are. “I will have them arrested when I feel better.” He said a doctor attached the part of his ear that was ripped off. “I nearly died for my own money,” said Paulos. Provincial police spokeswoman Sergeant Fikiswa Matoti said he should open a case as soon as he was feeling better.
