SHE is lucky to be alive! This is after her baby daddy repeatedly stabbed her. The incident happened in Verulam, north of Durban, on Saturday. The man is in hospital under police guard after being beaten by residents for stabbing the woman. Prem Balram, a spokesman for Reaction Unit South Africa, said the suspect was seriously injured. “Our members arrived on the scene at about 10.21am. They found the woman bleeding from at least six stab wounds on different parts of her body,” he said. “While attending to the woman, a group of men arrived at the scene with her baby daddy, who had fled earlier.” Balram said the men had assaulted the suspect. “A crowd of about 100 people joined in the assault. Reaction officers intervened and placed the suspect under arrest. Two officers were hurt during the scuffle.” He said the suspect was handed over to cops. Balram said the knife used to stab the woman was not recovered. According to a witness, the woman is a street vendor. “The woman and her baby daddy broke up two months ago. “The man had tried to hug the woman, but she pushed him away,” said the witness. “That’s when he pulled out a knife and stabbed her several times.” Another witness said the woman didn’t want the man to see his child because he never paid any papgeld. “We believe the suspect wanted to reconcile with the baby mama, but she rejected him and that’s when all hell broke loose.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of attempted murder was opened at Verulam cop shop. “A 25-year-old woman was assaulted by a known suspect in Verulam. The suspect was caught by the residents and handed over to the police.” Zwane said the suspect will appear in court today.
