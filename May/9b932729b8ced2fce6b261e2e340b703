NOT all Christians go to church on Sunday. Many prefer to go to taverns instead of church. Others are scared of going to church, where they might be criticised for drinking.  This is why Elijah Maleka (56) goes around to homes, spazas and taverns and preaches wherever he sees groups of people. He particularly enjoys preaching at taverns because many people there don’t go to church. On Sunday afternoon, Bishop Elijah, as he calls himself, decided to talk to people at Glovito’s Tavern in Zone 1 extension, Seshego outside Polokwane, Limpopo. Wearing a red robe, he told them: “God is everywhere and he is also here.  “Drink your alcohol in peace and do not forget to call upon God because he is always near, especially when you are drunk.” Maleka read Psalm 23 and emphasised verse four. “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.” He asked the people to join him in prayer to ask the Lord to protect people from road disasters.  Joseph Maphutha (43) said: “I will start following Maleka wherever he goes. He explains the Bible simply and I understand him very well.”
