SOCIAL media sensation Mbali Sibeko loves being on stage. As a music fan, the 31-year-old from Chiawelo in Soweto took videos of herself every morning and used lyrics from songs about what was happening in people’s daily lives. As luck would have it, she got to be an MC for the Amapiano events and is hosting the Corona Amapiano Sunset Experience at Moja Cafe in Soweto on Sunday. This will be the fourth time that she will host the event and she said it’s been a wonderful journey. Mbali never thought she would end up hosting events because she studied finance. But she said she was happy to MC the shows because they gave her exposure. “I would like to thank people for supporting me and for being so welcoming. “It is because of them that I’ve ended up working with an international brand. I love being part of this event because it embraces our local sound,” Mbali said people should come and join them. “I am looking forward to having fun at Moja Cafe. There is a mature crowd and I can’t wait to have fun with them. “The plan is to ensure people have a laid-back day as they are going to work the next day.”
