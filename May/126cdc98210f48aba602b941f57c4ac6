The guitarist played outside DJ Tiraâ€™s house until he woke up and instantly opened his studio and a collabo is on the way! Mdu Ncube is an aspiring musician and he is proof that if you are persistent enough, your dreams will come true! This, after the relatively unknown artist performed outside DJ Tira's house until the record label boss got up and took notice. Mdu decided to force DJ Tira to listen to him as he sang his heart out and strummed his guitar. After a couple of hours, Mdu's wish came through. Local promoter and Mampintsha's manager Dogg DBN, who happened to be at Tira's house, captured the moment. The artist now has his first paying and will perform alongside Babes Wodumo and Mampintsha. So this guy decided to come camp outside Afro Studios.... check the video for more info or my Facebook fan page DJ Tira.
