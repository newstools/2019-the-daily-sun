NAMIBIAN long distance runner Helalia Johannes displayed a sterling performance to win the first leg of the Spar Women's 10km Grand Prix Series in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. The Nedbank running club athlete  outclassed previous winners including Kesa Molotsane (Murray and Roberts) , Irvette Van Zyl  and Glenrose Xaba  (Boxer) to finish on course record time  of 31:50. The 17 year-old Ethiopian runner Tadu Teshame finished second on 32:38, while Molotsane came in third on 33.09 with Betha Chikanga getting fourth spot (33:39). But favorites Van Zyl finished in a disappointing 5th position on 33.39 having led the pack after 2km together with 38 year-old Johannes and Teshame. Meanwhile, Xaba who is eager to defend her title was nowhere to be seen among the front runners and she finished the race in an unfamiliar 9th on 34:10.
