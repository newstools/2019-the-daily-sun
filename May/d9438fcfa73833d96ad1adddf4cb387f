CUSTOMERs forgot their beers and ran for safety after the Maroma gang, armed with butchers’ knives, threatened to stab people at a party. Daily Sun has a video taken from a balcony of hundreds of patrons screaming and running for their lives. This happened in the streets of Bloemfontein on Saturday night after they heard the gang was on its way. Cops were called to the scene and shut down clubs. A 19-year-old man was brutally assaulted, allegedly by gang members. “It was about 11pm when the club owner told us the gang was coming. We were told to get out,” said a guest. “After going outside I saw people running and behind them were men armed with knives, broken beer bottles and axes. I went home.” Dimakatso Khumo (23) said: “My friends were robbed during the attack by more than 80 gang members.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said: “Cops were visible but nothing was reported to us.”
