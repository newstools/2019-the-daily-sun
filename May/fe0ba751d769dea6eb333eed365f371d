MZANSI will be celebrating Mother’s Day in style on Sunday. This day is in honour of the mother in the family, motherhood, maternal bonds and mothers’ influence in society. It’s celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in the months of March or May. Joburg’s favourite Italian restaurant, Zio in Jozi’s upmarket neighbourhood of Hyde Park, will have a Mother’s Day special. Owner Alessandro Khojane, said: “These women who gave us all life. What better way to ensure they get recognised and a bit of pampering on the day.“I’m hoping the cocktail menu, including a Martini Bianco and tonic topped with Martini Prosecco, finished off with a wedge of fresh lime,will please mum.”
