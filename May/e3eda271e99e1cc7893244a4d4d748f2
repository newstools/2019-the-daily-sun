A NURSING manager at a hospital in northern KZN resigned on Tuesday after being accused of raping a patient. According to a source at the hospital, security guards saw the psychiatric patient leaving the manager’s cottage, crying. “The guards asked her what was wrong. She pointed at her punani before telling them the manager, who lives in the cottage, had just raped her,” said the source. He said guards then took the patient to the casualty room. “Nurses examined her and it was confirmed she was raped.” The source said he had heard rumours it was not the first time the manager had poked a woman on the premises. KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the rape was something that should be confirmed by police. “We will check with the hospital to verify the resignation.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told Daily Sun: “I checked with Maphumulo cop shop, but nothing was reported.”
