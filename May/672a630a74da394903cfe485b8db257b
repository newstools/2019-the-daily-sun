FOR years residents of the squatter camp struggled to get a clear DStv picture. But they’ve made a plan! Residents of Allan’s Place in Montana, Tshwane, have mounted their satellite dishes in a tree. Fortunate Ncube said his dish used to be on top of his shack but the pictures on his TV would go blurry while watching his favourite shows. “At first I feared my dish would be stolen, but every morning I wake up to find it’s still there.” Fortunate said he can now watch everything on TV, and his children can watch cartoons. “People love it when they see the dishes in the trees,” he said.
