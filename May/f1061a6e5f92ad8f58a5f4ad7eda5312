PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma will be appearing in the KwaZulu Natal
High Court in Pietermaritzburg facing charges of corruption, fraud, money
laundering and racketeering. The French company Thales is accused number two, also accused
of corruption and fraud. If this weekâ€™s application by Zuma is unsuccessful, Thales will face
one count of money laundering, two counts of corruption and one count of
racketeering. In 1997, Thales won a R2.6bn stake in South Africa's R60bn
arms acquisition programme to supply combat systems for four frigates procured
by the navy. The case involves 783 questionable payments to Zuma,
allegedly received from the company in connection with the arms deal. The company reiterated that it had no knowledge of any
transgressions being committed by any of its staff in relation to the arms
deal. Meanwhile, Duduzane Zuma who is also facing a capable
homicide charge was seen at the KwaZulu-Natal High Court to support his father.
