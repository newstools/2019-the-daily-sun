You can now stop wondering when Chad will put a ring on Kelly, he has shut our mouths with the huge bling he put on Kelly’s finger. The couple recently made their marriage 'official' and sealing it with a song together! The artists have been on and off but it seems as if things are going really well and the couple is more determined than ever to make things work. In 2018, the two spotted matching tattoos which led to the engagement speculations, however even after the alleged marriage no rings were spotted. The singer's fans were calling Chad a cheapskate, asking him when he will get Kelly a ring. In an Instagram post, Chad has showcased the wedding bands, “Pepereza Pepereza Nyefe Nyefe Nyefe ...Where’s her ring ?” he captioned the post.
