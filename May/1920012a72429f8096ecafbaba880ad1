POWER was restored yesterday afternoon in the Durban CBD and surrounding areas. This was after a transformer apparently exploded at Klaarwater, Durban, in the early hours of Tuesday morning. It left resident in darkness, as well as putting out traffic lights and ATMs. Shops and restaurants in the CBD were also affected. However, yesterday afternoon residents of Lindelani in KwaDukuza, north of Durban, told Daily Sun they still didn’t have electricity. Ncamisile Mkhize (46), who rents a flat in the CBD, said: “My children had to bath in cold water on Tuesday and yesterday. I couldn’t even make breakfast for them so they went to school without eating. “This is totally unfair because we pay for electricity.” She said eThekwini Municipality should have dealt with the matter immediately. A shopper Nompilo Mchunu (42) said she was upset when she arrived in the city yesterday to find there was no electricity. “I didn’t realise there wasn’t electricity until I went to an ATM to withdraw some cash. “I needed money to buy a few things but even the stores were dark inside. It was just a terrible thing.” Nompilo said she ended up leaving without buying anything. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela confirmed there was a fault at one of their transformers which resulted in electricity outages in some areas. “But our engineers are attending to the problem.” He urged residents to be patient as they were working around the clock to restore power to all affected areas.
