HE USED all his talent to feed a crazy lifestyle of booze and fun. Former Orlando Pirates and Jomo Cosmos midfielder Gerald Modabi told Daily Sun he behaved badly and his social conduct didn’t support his professional behaviour. “I enjoyed the night more than the day and used my talent to feed a crazy night lifestyle of alcohol,” he said. The 37-year-old said he didn’t regret his actions, but the timing was bad. “All I did was supposed to happen after football.” Gerald, who also played for Dynamos, said he lost over R1,5 million in sign- on fees over a period of 10 years. He said he still remembered how he splashed the cash. “There was a time in 2007 when I spent about R10 000 in one night at a club in Sandton and I never felt bad about it,” said Gerald. He said many players were embarrassed to open up about their past, but those who did got healing. Gerald, who retired from the beautiful game in 2012, runs an academy called Free Kick Specialist in Ilovo, Joburg.
