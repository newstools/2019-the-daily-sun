EFF leader Julius Malema has made a vow to his fallen pillar of strength and grandmother Sara Malema that he will never go back to the ANC. HE vowed in front of her coffin that if his political party fails he would either become a teacher, a farmer or a lawyer, than go back to the ANC. "Every time when they smoke nyaope they say I must come back to the ANC. I will never forget the words ANC people told my grandmother… that they will dig my mother’s grave and rebury it in front of her gate."  "Her heart was sore when I was expelled from the ANC and she warned me that if I go back, they will kill me. I now vow in front of your coffin that I will never go there. My family was harassed because of me but we stood together regardless of that," Malema said at his Grandmother funeral service today at Ngoako Ramahlodi Sports Complex in Seshego. Malema was sharing his family struggles with those in attendance. "I followed my grandmother's way, through difficulties I would always go back to her for advice. Those who never listened to her never succeeded. I have lost a grandmother but I have earned a lot from her," he said.  A 90-year-old Koko Sara died last week Saturday at her home in Seshego outside Polokwane and buried today. Malema further thanked EFF members for welcoming them when they started the party.
