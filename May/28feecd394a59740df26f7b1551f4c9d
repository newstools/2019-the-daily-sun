PARENTS often find themselves conflicted about how to guide their sons. Aggression can be an indication of factors such as mood disorders, frustration, conduct disorder, injuries and at times trauma. It is important to understand the root cause of negative behaviour and address it. Things to discuss: When kids misbehave, parents tend to respond with criticism or punishment, stopping children from learning healthy ways to express their feelings. Everyone has a responsibility to end violence and ensure the safety of women and children who continue to be at risk.
