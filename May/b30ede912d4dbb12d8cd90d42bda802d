IT SEEMS AKA and Dj Zinhle have rekindled their love. In recent months rumours had it that the two might be back in each other's arms. It now appears that the rumours were not far from the truth. AKA posted a picture of Dj Zinhle sitting on his lap on Instagram with the caption "opposite attracts". The pair ended their 3-year relationship in 2015 after Zinhle accused the rapper of having an affair with Bonang 'Queen B' Matheba. At the time Zinhle was pregnant with their first child. However, not everyone is pleased with the reunion of the two celebs. Social media is divided.  Opposites attract. ?????? ?? by @welcometoromesa A post shared by  AKA (@akaworldwide) on May 6, 2019 at 5:03am PDT
