WHEN Siqalo residents in Mitchells Plain protested about services last Tuesday, Zikhona Ntshebe (26) did not know she would end up being hurt. She claimed that cops fired rubber bullets at residents and she was injured in the cheek. “We were not violent, but cops fired rubber bullets at us,” she said. “I’m very angry about what the police did.” Zikhona said she wanted cops to pay for what they did to her. “I want those cops to face the consequences of their actions. “They can’t just hurt people as they wish and get away with it.” Her sister Bandlakazi (30) said she was shocked when she saw Zikhona. “It was horrifying because there was blood all over her clothes,” she told Daily Sun. “We didn’t open a case because I doubt if the police would even help us.” Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, advised Zikhona to open a case so the matter could be investigated. “She can open a case at any police station. “The matter will be forwarded to us for investigation,” he said.
