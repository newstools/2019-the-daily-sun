THEY thought they were opening their church doors to a fellow churchgoer. But now it looks as if they opened their hearts to a devil! Some members of the Desire of Jesus Apostolic Church in Ivory Park, near Tembisa in Ekurhuleni, contributed between R1 000 and R1 200 each to help a woman in need. But she was not even a member of the church but a scammer. The church lost almost R10 000. The congregants said the scammer invaded their chat group on WhatsApp and pretended to be part of the church after pasting a photo of a fellow church member in her profile. “We suspect she had inside information. Only people who are working were robbed,” said Mlungisi Magagula. Mlungisi was cheated out of R1 200 after a WhatsApp conversation with the con artist. He said the woman told him to deposit the money via Pep Stores. “She promised to give me back my money two days later. She was even willing to pay back the money with interest,” he said. Mlungisi went to deposit the money and it was quickly withdrawn. After realising it was a scam, he rushed to reverse the transaction but it was too late. Bishop William Mnamathi said last Thursday he went to Dudu Mavuso’s house to personally give her the money the church had collected. But she wouldn’t take it. She has since disappeared. Mlungisi Simelane said he was going to deposit R1 200. “But I got the WhatsApp message warning everybody,” she said. Church members said cops initially refused to open a case, saying they had voluntarily given the money to the scammer. But Captain Bernard Matimulane of Tembisa police encouraged the victims to lay fraud charges.
