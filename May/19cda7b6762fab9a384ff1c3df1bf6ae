KAIZER Chiefs chairman Kaizer Motaung has defended his embattled son Bobby Motaung who has faced a barrage of criticism for the clubs’ poor performance in the last four seasons. Motaung said that they’re happy with Bobby, who is the Football Director, at Amakhosi. “He would not be there if we were not happy with him. You must go back in history where he started at the club and up to now. We are all party to failure today and you cannot put it to an individual and blame him,” said Motaung. Motaung explained that Bobby was not the one buying players. “Even the question of buying players, it’s not Bobby who is buying players, he is just a messenger. He’s part of team that sits with the technical staff and talk about getting new players. He is not the man who decides which players to buy.” Motaung senior added that he was still hands-on at the club. “I have not taken a backseat I am working every day. We have structures that deal with each and every aspect of the club. Decisions are not done by individuals. Important decisions are taken by the collective. "We are busy sorting things out…we will be ready in the next three weeks and there will be new developments over all." "We will be having a strategic session, towards the end of the month. We are going through a process now, and whatever developments that will take place we will let you know in the next three weeks,” Motaung added. Kaizer Motaung told the media after the ICASA public
hearings in Irene, on Wednesday afternoon.
