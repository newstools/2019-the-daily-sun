BEING a zama zama’s not easy. They enter the heart of the earth to dig for gold dust. But when they come to the surface, they find scavengers waiting for them. On Monday, two illegal miners were killed, allegedly over a bag of gold dust. They came out to the surface and found others waiting for them, and a fight started. One was shot dead while another was crushed with stones. The zama zama who was shot dead was lying on the Putfontein off-ramp near Freeway Park squatter camp, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni. He apparently tried to run away. The other body was found lying not far from shaft 14. Freeway Park residents said illegal miners put their lives at risk. “These people fight now and then. At times the fights are even dragged to the squatter camp, where they shoot each other,” said a resident. “We live in fear because we don’t know when the next fight will start. We have to duck stray bullets.” One zama zama said most people who terrorised them were members of the Basotho gang. “They wait for us to go down and we find them waiting for us. We either have to share or they take the whole sack. “If you stand up to them, they kill you. I give them what they want to save my life,” he said. Captain Nomsa Sekele of Benoni said cops were investigating two cases of murder.
