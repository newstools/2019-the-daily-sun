THE education department’s district office in Port Elizabeth has been in the dark for almost a month. While staff members have only been working half-day, they have been forced to turn away pupils needing help. A 19-year-old pupil told Daily Sun: “Every time I come here, I’m told by security guards there is no service, because the department has no electricity. “I applied forthe navy and was accepted but I need a copy of my results to be enrolled in their programme. “Now the department is not functioning and I’m unable to get a copy.” A staff member told the SunTeam their computers were not working, so they couldn’t print documents. “We don’t know exactly why we don’t have electricity. We suspect the municipality has not been paid. We only work until 1pm.” A widow said she needed help with documents as her husband was a teacher and died last month. “But I cannot get help because there is no electricity here,” she said. Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said it wasn’t true that the office was closed later in the day as he was in the office until 4.30pm. “The electricity supply was disconnected due to non-payment by schools. Payment has been prepared and we’re waiting for it to show in the municipal account.”
