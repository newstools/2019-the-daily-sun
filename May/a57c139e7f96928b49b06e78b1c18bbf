BAROKA veteran Letladi Madubanya says he has not considered the possibility of retirement anytime soon. The 35-year-old Alexander born player, who is still contracted to Bakgaga, believes he still has a couple of years to play at the top level. “I want to continue playing football. I would love to see out my contract at Baroka,” said Madubanya, who has been playing in the PSL for more than a decade. “The past season was tough but the good thing is that we managed to maintain our status, and also winning the Telkom Knockout Cup was a first trophy in the top flight for Baroka. “I am happy to be part of that history with Baroka. “We had a young team of players who were playing for the first time in the top flight and they did well.” Madubanya added: “We also had a new coach (Wedson Nyirenda) and he did a good job in his debut season in the PSL. “So I want to continue working hard and help Baroka improve and win trophies next season.” Madubanya lost his captaincy to Mduduzi Mdantsane, and also didn’t see much action under their Zambian born-mentor. “I would love to play but I am also happy to help the youngsters, who look up to players like me because I have been in the game for years,” he explained. Players who are retiring this season are the likes of Teko Modise (36), Siyabonga Nomvethe (41) and Morgan Gould (36). Modise, one of the most decorated players in the country, ended his football career playing for Benni McCarthy’s Cape Town City, while Nomvethe, who has played for more than two decades in the PSL and in European, retired at AmaZulu. Gould, who used to play with Madubanya at SuperSport United, will hang up his boots at Matsatsantsa a Pitori, where he is tipped to be given a new role within the club. Other veterans who continue to play are the likes of Polokwane City captain Jabulani Maluleke (37) and Reneilwe Letsholonyane (36). The former Kaizer Chiefs and Jomo Cosmos midfielder has already been released by United. Letsholonyane is looking for a new club.
