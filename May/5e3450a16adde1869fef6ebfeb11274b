HE thought he could rob a woman and get away with it! But his luck quickly ran out when he was caught by residents, who heard the woman screaming for help. The unknown man allegedly robbed the woman (45) of her bag and cellphone at a bus stop. The woman was returning from work at Amanzimtoti, south of Durban, on Sunday. They caught him and gave him a beating before stabbing him to death. KZN cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an unknown man was allegedly assaulted by residents in Amanzimtoti. “He was allegedly caught robbing a woman,” he said. “A murder case was opened at Amanzimtoti Police Station for further investigation. “We appeal to residents not to take the law into their own hands.” He said those who get involved in mob justice will be arrested because they are breaking the law.
