With Mother’s Day fast approaching, allow me to dedicate this letter to all mothers who do it alone. I speak of mothers who play the dual roles of mother and father to their kids. There is nobody stronger than a single parent. And just because you are a single mother does not mean you cannot be a success story. I greatly admire those parents who are raising a part of their future alone. From the children’s births up to their teenage years, there is no greater task than being the only adult in their lives. However, what you do is twice as rewarding because once your children are old enough and have jobs, you will receive twice as much from them. In later years, your children will never forget everything you went through to raise them. Being a working single mother instils in you a sense of determination to see your kids living like any other kids who have both parents. Single mothers who do not spend their time chasing after men but spend it trying to provide for their children are the most admirable people on earth. To men who choose to date single mums, it does not mean you are duty-bound to play the role of dad. It just means you will become part of the family and be a role model for your partner’s children. If you are not ready to step up, do not bother asking their mum out because she deserves a strong man. In fact, such women do not need men as they are domestic engineers, general executives, private investigators, project foremen, mediators, data management specialists, CFOs, maintenance managers and the CEOs of their families. They are the breadwinners, the heads of their households and rule enforcers. They are also appointment makers, prescription fillers, chefs, mechanics and handymen. Being a single parent is not a life full of struggle, but a journey for the strong! Heilbron
