CAPE Town City coach Benni McCarthy believes his young team will be a force to be reckoned with in the Absa Premiership in a few years’ time. The Citizens have been on a steady climb since McCarthy took over in 2017. They currently occupy fourth spot on the standings with 48 points from 29 matches. They are set to finish the current season in the top four, and have already surpassed last season’s tally of 40 points. One of the standout players for the Citizens this season, has been defender Taariq Fielies. The 26-year-old center back has featured 25 times for the Citizens and has one goal and an assist to his name. McCarthy believes Fielies’ form warrants a call-up to Stuart Baxter’s Bafana Bafana. “Fielies, how this boy doesn’t get a Bafana call-up is beyond me,” said McCarthy. “He is got football brains, calm and collected on the ball, scandalous in the air, you know, and he’s a goal threat and very aggressive. “But anyway, I’m just glad I’ve got these kind of players in my team.”
