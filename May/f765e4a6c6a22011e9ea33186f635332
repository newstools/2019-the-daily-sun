THE political life of a person is shortlived. That’s according to Thulamela mayor Avhashoni Tshifhango. “One should be ready to face the outside world after politics, and education is the only weapon to open other doors in life,” he said. On Tuesday Tshifhango was one of 3066 University of Venda students who received diplomas, certificates and degrees at the graduation ceremony. He received a Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting. His certificate was handed over by Chancellor Kgalema Motlanthe. Tshifhango said it has always been his dream to further his studies. “Leaders should be enlightened and there is no other way to achieve this than through education,” he said. He believes in leading by example and his achievement will go a long way towards motivating the youth to take their education seriously.
