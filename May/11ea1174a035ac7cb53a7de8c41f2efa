The Hawks have arrested a 45-year-old Seshego District Court prosecutor for alleged corruption, extortion and defeating the ends of justice. The prosecutor allegedly demanded a R1500 bribe from the accuser who was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in order to withdraw his case. Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said the accuser reported the matter to the Hawks who swiftly conducted an undercover operation that resulted in the arrest of the prosecutor in her office, soon after accepting a bribe. He said Hawks investigations reveal that the case of driving under the influence of alcohol against the complainant was indeed withdrawn. The suspect will appear at the Seshego Magistrateâ€™s Court.
