MOSES Mthombeni was horrified when an angry mob set his shack alight and tried to braai his horse. The 60-year-old from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun his horse Dumezweni only survived thanks to cops arriving and dispersing the crowd with rubber bullets. Moses said the mob arrived at his house on Wednesday, claiming his grandson had stolen from residents and that he was hiding him. “I tried to explain to them he wasn’t with me, but they didn’t want to take my word for it.” Moses said his grandson used to visit for short periods, but he had no idea where he was. He said he was grateful the cops arrived on time. “They would have killed my livelihood if they braaied my horse.” Moses said the horse pulls a car when he goes to collect material for recycling. My horse is good and reliable, but he was traumatised and it will take a while for him to get over this. There are people who eat horse meat, and I could see how desperate they were to braai my horse. “I could hear them saying my horse would repay them for the things my grandson stole. They were rude and I didn’t want to argue and be thrown in the same fire.” A case of malicious damage to property was opened at KwaThema cop shop, but no arrests were made.
