THE accused in the murder case of Mpumalanga businessman Sam Sibiya (62) has pleaded not guilty. Jacob Maunye (54), who was working as head of security at Dwarsloop Mall, appeared before Magistrate Elmarie Theron in Mhala Court in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Thursday. He told the court he shot Sibiya because his life was in danger. He had asked Sibiya not to park his vehicle at the mall during the night. “We argued and I realised he had produced a firearm and when I acted in self-defence, he threatened to smash my head.” The court also heard the testimony of centre manager Judgment Mdluli (29). Mdluli said he was in a meeting with Maunye, when he went to ask Sibiya to remove his car from the parking lot. “I heard the two arguing and later sounds of shooting broke out. That’s when the accused confessed to have shot the driver,” Mdluli said. Thabo Magabe, the lawyer representing Maunye, asked the court to clear the accused because the state failed to prove its case. “Witnesses didn’t observe what happened and Sibiya was angry and attacked Maunye before wrestling him for the firearm,” Magabe said. The magistrate told the court there was not enough evidence to prosecute the accused and dismissed the case.
