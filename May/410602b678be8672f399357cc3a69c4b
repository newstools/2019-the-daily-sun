FORMER ANC branch treasurer Martin Sithole (48), who was due to testify against Newcastle mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba, was killed at his Newcastle bottle store on Sunday. His friend Frank Shange (60) also died. The local ANC Youth League said Sithole was the victim of a hit. Regional chairman Senzo Dlamini said Sithole had already given a statement to cops about Mahlaba’s involvement in political killings. “They killed Shange to destroy the evidence. The suspects were sent to silence him as he had solid evidence on the 2016 murder of youth league deputy secretary Wandile Ngubeni. Sithole had no enemies.” The mayor was released on bail after being bust in March for Ngubeni’s murder. He was also charged with attempted murder as youth league secretary Mafika Mndebele was wounded. Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said two men were killed and three bystanders wounded. “Two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder are being investigated. “ The task team investigating political killings will take this over,” he said.
