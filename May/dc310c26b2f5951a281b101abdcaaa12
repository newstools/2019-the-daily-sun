ACTOR Sayitsheni Mdakhi, who plays Saddam on Isibaya, is going to do a five-day writing and producing course with story consultant Robert McKee in London, UK. Sayitsheni, who left yesterday, said the classes are part of his training as a junior producer at film company Bomb Shelter. He said his enthusiasm as a storyliner on Isithembiso led to the company’s Desiree Markgraaff and Angus Gibson mentoring him. “I started training as a junior producer last year. I’m going to sharpen my producing and writing skills.” He said he learnt about McKee in 2016 after producer Kutlwano Ditsele gave him a screenwriting audio book. “I was inspired,” said Sayitsheni. He said going to London would be the start of his dream. “It’s a great opportunity. I’m ready to learn. It’s like the building blocks of my career guiding me where to go. Acting is like my side chick.” Sayitsheni has written and produced his own movie Intethelelo, which was screened in March.
