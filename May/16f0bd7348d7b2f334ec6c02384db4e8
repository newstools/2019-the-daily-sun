THE family of a woman whose rotting body was found at her lover’s house on Friday said the man shouldn’t be given bail. Solile Chonco (35) from Dukuduku Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, was allegedly stoned to death by her boyfriend. The two had been living together for about four months. Relative Zanele Chonco (35) told Daily Sun: “The suspect’s family in Greytown told the cops that the suspect had confessed that he did kill Solile.” Zanele said the suspect apparently bragged he killed Solile after she told him she was going to buy groceries but came back empty-handed. “He had no right to kill our loved one, no matter how he felt. We don’t know how he could kill her for not coming back with groceries.” Zanele said the suspect was a monster who deserved to be locked up. “Women are not safe around him if he’s capable of killing over a stupid thing like that and brag about it. Our loved one is dead, but the next person he falls in love with won’t be safe.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of murder was opened at Mtubatuba cop shop and a 32-year-old man was bust. “The body of a 35-year-old woman was found with an open wound to the head and a bruise on the throat.”
