SOME people get away with rape, but this man was not so lucky. A video said to have been filmed in Tshwane recently went viral, showing an alleged rapist walking naked in the streets and begging for forgiveness. In the video, he screams: “Forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! I’ve raped. Arrest me! Arrest me! Arrest me!” The motorist filming the video pulls over and asks him what’s going on. “Uncle, I raped my cousin,” he says before the motorist asks if the cousin put a spell on him. “No, she didn’t. I’m just walking like this asking for forgiveness. There’s no other way,” he says. The naked man says the cousin lives in Karen Park, east of Tshwane. “I’m going to my cousin to ask for forgiveness,” he says before the motorist says he’s sorry for what he’s going through and stops filming. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said the man might have been cursed by the rape victim. “If he really raped her, the victim might have decided to deal with him the traditional way. “He has to go to her and ask for forgiveness and find a sangoma to break the curse,” she said. Captain Herman Moremi said they were not aware of the video. “He can be arrested for public indecency but not rape, unless a case was reported. “If the victim didn’t open one, police can’t arrest him.”
