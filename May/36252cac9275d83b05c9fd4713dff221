A NUMBER of voting boxes were found under trees at Kopano Hall voting station in Dobsonville, Soweto, yesterday. An angry EFF convener at the scene, Mogadi Mailula, said: “The boxes were found by one of my colleagues as they were being loaded into a car, which was parked under the trees at Kopano. We are not happy with this situation because on Wednesday ANC members were boasting they would vote multiple times. “They said we should know they have already won and we are beaten. The other problem was that IEC officials did not stamp ballot papers.” EFF member Winile Lebotse said: “As a runner for the EFF, I was shocked when I saw the boxes.” Moses Pitso, IEC assistant manager responsible for communications, said the boxes were rolled back to Kopanong Hall and the Metro cops provided an escort from the station. “Counting had already been completed and party agents were in attendance. The EFF members who observed and reported this incident were not party agents at the station.”
