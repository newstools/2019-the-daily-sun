Vusi Gumede always dreamt of owning a funeral parlour, so he did all he could to make it happen. He became a taxi driver in 2016 to make money to start his business. And nearly three years later, the 27-year-old’s dream finally came true. Vusi from KwaNyuswa in Durban is now the proud founder of Peaceful Funeral Services, launched on 1 May. His offices are in KwaNyuswa next to the taxi rank. He told Daily Sun he registered his business in 2014, but due to financial difficulties he couldn’t start operating immediately. He said although he started out driving a taxi, he’d always known it would only be for a short while. “Driving a taxi didn’t bother me. I knew why I took the decision in the first place,” said Vusi. “I managed to save enough money to start running my business this year.” He said a lot of taximen had promised to support his business. Vusi said owning a funeral parlour had always been his dream. “I finished matric in 2008. Then in 2009 I did a one-year course in plumbing at Elangeni TVET College,” he told the People’s Paper. “When I finished I started a plumbing business, but it didn’t go well. I stopped after I realised I needed to follow my passion.” He said there were many funeral parlours in his area, but he believes his will be different from the rest. “I say it will be different because I’m still young and will come with new ideas. “I allow youth who have funeral plans with us to come to our offices to do photocopies, send faxes and type their CVs for free,” he said.
