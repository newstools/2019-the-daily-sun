THE world we live in encourages people, especially millenials, to be more free-spirited and open-minded. Beauty is also about your wellbeing. With every star-studded post by your favourite celebrity on social media, there is a sense of ‘effort’ to portray that ‘it looks’, and with that ‘it look’ is a hairdresser that made a work of art and a make-up artist that mastered the canvas.With that glowing skin, there is a somatologist who had an interest in helping others improve their general wellness and overall appearance through information and practice of healthy lifestyle habits, product use and clinical treatments. Enzi Hair and Beauty Institute aims to train people on the importance of being beautiful – not only about how someone looks but their general wellbeing. Founded by a mother of three, Tshidi Molefe, the institute aims to increase more qualified ethnic professional hairdressers and beauty therapist in Mzansi. “This will contribute toward changing the face of the ethnic hair and beauty industry which is largely informal and perceived to be unprofessional,” Tshidi told the People’s Paper. The Enzi Hair & Beauty institute is a training academy that offers qualifications aligned with the National Qualifications Framework and the South African Qualifications Authority. It provides full-time and part-time courses and is also an accredited Trade Test Centre for Hairdressing. The Joburg-based institution and salon has a staff complement of 14 and 150 students. Tshidi explained: “The Enzi brand story is a beautiful one for me because many people who worked at the hair studio only knew how to groom, but never really had the necessary training or qualification required in finding an accredited institution.
