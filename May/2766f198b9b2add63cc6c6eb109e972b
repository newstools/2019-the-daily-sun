TENDER problems at Transnet were caused by officials’ wilful blindness. Governance head Peter Volmink yesterday told the Zondo Commission some officials refused to follow the rules. “There were instances where we saw irregular expenditure at Transnet due to bungling, but with the big ticket items, especially those at board and executive committee level, it is very difficult for me to believe people at that level simply did not know what the rules were.” Volmink said the rules broken were not complex. He said sometimes officials advertised a tender at short notice to prevent other companies from bidding, so a preferred company would win. His unit also foundthat officials acted outside their authority. “This led to instances where officials awarded tenders at much higher values than agreed.” Volmink said another issue his unit found was that procurement officials were put under pressure by senior managers to fast track the tender process. Management and the new board had developed plans to make sure it didn’t happen anymore, he said. They had addressed the culture of bullying and intimidation to make officials follow illegal instructions. Asked about former group chief executive Brian Molefe cancelling a tender awarded to T-Systems and giving it to Neotel, Volmink said it was foolish. “It violates the principle of equal treatment. You can’t give a bidder a second bite of the cherry. It’s not right.”
