THE Blesbok River is known for being dangerous – several years ago two people fell into the river and were never found. But last Thursday night Madimungo Macaroni didn’t think twice when armed thugs were chasing him. He jumped into the river in Springs, Ekurhuleni, to hide from thugs who shot at him. He was not shot, and he thanks the river for protecting him. Madimungo, from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, managed to get out of the river to find help. “I thank my God for hiding me from those thugs. They wanted to see me dead,” he said. He was with two co-workers when the truck they were travelling in got stuck in the mud. “We struggled to pull it out, and, as we were busy, I saw five men approaching with a lamp and they started shooting,” he said. Madimungo said two of his co-workers were shot and one died. “I ran away but the thugs followed me. Their aim was to kill me. I jumped into the river without thinking. “I told myself I’d rather drown, but my ancestors were on my side. I don’t how I survived in that river as it’s very dangerous and deep.” The father of the dead man, Elfas Nyathi, said he hated the people who took his child’s life. He said his son helped in the family business. Captain Johannes Ramphora said they were looking for five armed suspects. “This isn’t the first time they have robbed or killed people. We urge people not to hike in that spot or stop there.” Anyone with information is asked to contact cops on 08600 10111.
