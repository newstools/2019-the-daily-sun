A MEMBER of the Ekurhuleni Metro police department is accusing the department of nepotism, favouritism and tribalism. Kgoputso Mampane is a constable in the EMPD with a law degree. He told Daily Sun he has seen the CVs of both the chief of police, Isaac Mapiyeye, who was appointed in 2017, and his deputy Goodman Mzolo and they didn’t have the required qualifications. He claims he has been at the same rank since 2009 while others without relevant qualifications have been promoted. Mampane said each time he applies he is told he is over-qualified. “Some constables do not even have matric certificates.” He said the department recently appointed 14 officers to superintendent posts but claims the process was not transparent. The EMPD’s spokesman, Wilfred Kgasago, said Mampane had presenting the same issues before and his arbitration case had failed. “The chief of police and deputy chief of police have been fully vetted and all their qualifications have been verified.” Kgasago said Mampane did not perform well in his interview for the position of superintendent.
