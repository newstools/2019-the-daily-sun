TRAIN services in KZN were disrupted following the floods that hit the province last month. Commuters were told it may take a month before trains start running normally again. But worried commuters told Daily Sun yesterday they wanted Prasa to attend to the matter speedily. Nompilo Mchunu (49) from KwaMashu said the train is the only mode of transport she can afford. “We understand this was caused by floods. But they should work fast because taxis are expensive,” she said. Another commuter, Mbuso Dlamini (51), said he bought a monthly ticket for April but was now forced to use a taxi. “It has cost me a lot of money,” he said. Prasa regional manager Dumi Dube said services were suspended on all routes. He said they were fixing affected areas.
