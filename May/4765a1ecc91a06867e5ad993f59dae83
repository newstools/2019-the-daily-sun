DYLAN Kerr has dismissed rumours that he will be joining Free State Stars at the end of season. According to a reliable source, Kerr, who is currently in charge of relegation haunted Black Leopards, has allegedly agreed in principle to join Ea Lla Koto when his contract expires next month. This would mean Nikola Kavazovic, current Stars mentor who replaced Belgian coach Luc Eymael at the start of the season, will have to make way. The Serbian-born Kavazovic has failed to move Stars to safety since he arrived in November last year and has laid the blame on Eymael last week, who in turn retaliated. Said the source: “Dylan has agreed verbally that he will join Stars before the start of the new season.” Although Stars are in danger of being relegated, the source revealed that Kerr doesn’t mind to coach them in the National First Division (NFD) next season as his future at Leopards is uncertain. Ironically, the Bethlehem-based side are second bottom tied with Leopards on 27 points, with one round of matches still to be played. The two clubs are a point ahead of basement side Maritzburg United. Explained the source: “Whether Stars get relegated or not, Kerr will be with them next season.” When contacted for comment, Kerr insists that the rumours are just a lot of hogwash. He went on: “I have never spoked to anybody. “They (Stars) have never contacted me and I think it’s only people who are gossiping.” The Englishman said his priority is to ensure Leopards survive relegation. Lidoda Duvha face Cape Town City in their last match of the season at Thohoyandou Stadium, Venda, on Saturday (3pm). But it’s unlikely that Kerr will retain his job if Leopards are relegated. He has lost control of the dressing room with allegations that other players skip training, while others ignore his instructions on the pitch. Leopards have dropped 19 points in the process, having gone seven matches without a win following a 1-1 draw with AmaZulu in Durban at the weekend.
