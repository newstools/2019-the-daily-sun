FOURTEEN kids were rushed to hospital after an explosion in a room they were sleeping in at a kasi creche. Two teachers were also injured. According to Councillor Phumzile Hlatshwayo, the kids were sleeping in a room that also housed a gas cylinder when the explosion happened in Soshanguve, Tshwane, on Monday. Social Development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza visited hospitalised kids on Tuesday. She said most of them suffered more than 20% burns over their bodies. She said one child was in ICU, one was discharged, while the rest were still in hospital. “It’s heartbreaking to see young ones in such excruciating pain,” she said. “It’s just as sad to see their helpless parents going through such trauma.” She said they will provide counselling for the victims. Leonard Katwai, the principal’s husband, said his wife was upset and trying to make sense of what had happened. The SunTeam was not allowed in and was told there was no fire, but that kids did get burned. Creche staff said they will have a meeting with parents tomorrow to explain what happened.
