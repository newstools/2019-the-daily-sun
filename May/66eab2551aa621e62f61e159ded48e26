Hey MizzB I’M an 18-year-old who is in her first year at university. Last month I met a guy and we started spending time together. He made me feel so special because of the way he treated me. But after he took my virginity he left. He said he didn’t love me and only wanted to sleep with me. I feel so broken after being fooled by this guy. Hey, Girl Dating has its risks. A person either leaves you heartbroken or happy sometimes. It doesn’t mean when a boy desires you he values you. You must take your power back and focus on your studies. A better life awaits you because you’re beautiful. You’re also capable of achieving anything in life as long as you set your mind to it.
