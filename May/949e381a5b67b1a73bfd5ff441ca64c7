TWO days before the election, the colours of the ANC, the EFF, the DA and other parties were displayed around the country as political parties tried to swing voters in their favour. President Cyril Ramaphosa, at the Siyanqoba rally at Ellis Park, Joburg, promised jobs which he said would be the way forward. He told thousands of party supporters that the ANC will retain power while appealing to voters to forgive the party for its past mistakes. He promised that the era of accountability had started. “We are now entering the era of consequences. We are determined that those found guilty of corruption or involvement in state capture will not be allowed to occupy positions of power either in the ANC, parliament or government.” Ramaphosa heard people speak of their aspirations, concerns and frustrations. Speaking at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, Julius Malema said the ANC and the DA were scared. “Comrades, you have shaken the ANC. The ANC is scared of you. We are proud of the fighters in Western Cape. We never expected to shake the racist DA. In the Western Cape, they are shaking.” He said if cops wanted to shoot they must go to Luthuli House. “Shoot Ace Magashule and arrest Mike Maile, David Makhura, Paul Mashatile. Why are you not arresting Ramaphosa?” Malema said people should stop talking nonsense about the EFF in the VBS report. Malema said his gogo would have wanted him to be where he was. “She knew that today I could not be with her but I would be with you,” he said. DA leader Mmusi Maimane appealed to the electorate to give his party one term to govern. Addressing party supporters at Dobsonville Stadium, Maimane said the ANC could not be trusted after 25 years of governing without delivering. “The future is blue. We are everywhere. We are young, we are old, we are black, we are white, we are gay, we are straight. We are everywhere. Just give us five years,” he said.
