The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has appealed to political parties to reduce political activities. This is to allow space for voting to take place peacefully. The plea comes as 770 000 voters are set to cast their votes for the 2019 elections. THE IEC said at all times, any hindrance or obstructions in the work of the Commission in the exercising of its duties is prohibited. According IEC the Electoral Act (73 of 1997) also specifically prohibits political meetings, marches, demonstrations or any other political event taking place on voting day. It also prohibits strikes and lockouts in the public transport and telecommunications sectors,” said the IEC on Sunday. Chief Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo said strictly speaking this applies only to 8 May, voting will be taking place at voting stations and through home visits on Monday and Tuesday. Mamabolo sad they expect over 770 000 voters to cast their ballots. “The time for robust campaigning has ended. Now is the time for voting. Let’s give voters the time and space to consider their options and make their choices this week in an atmosphere of peaceful reflection,” he said. The Commission has also urged communities not to engage in any civil unrest, protests or demonstrations that may impact on electoral operations. “We have engaged with the security agencies, including the South African Police Service, to ensure that no disruptions to the elections are tolerated.” The Commission warned voters not to be fooled by disinformation, including about voting hours. Special voting will take place on Monday and Tuesday from 9am to 5pm, and voting on Election Day.
