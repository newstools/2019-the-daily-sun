GOOD party leader Patricia de Lille yesterday said she was deeply honoured to serve as a minister in the new cabinet. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday night named her as the new minister of public works and infrastructure. The former Cape Town mayor formed her new party late last year after falling out with the DA. She said she spent more than 40 years fighting for justice and had no plans to give up. “I will continue to lead Good and to fight for a responsible, accountable and compassionate government,” she said. “On President Ramaphosa’s election, I pledged Good’s constructive support for turning South Africa around. “But I will be joining the executive with open eyes and ears as a representative of good South Africans of integrity who love their country and demand better leaders.” After the announcement, people took to social media to say De Lille deserved happiness after her treatment in the DA. But some said the ANC was just trying to swallow Good. Henry McDonald wrote on Facebook: “Remember Marthinus van Schalkwyk from the then NNP? ANC minister of tourism? Be careful, Auntie Pat.”
