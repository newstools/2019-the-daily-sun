THE Champagne is on ice... The Absa Premiership title race enters its final stretch tomorrow and a lot is expected. But who will pop the bottle and celebrate sweet victory between Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates? Well, that is the million-dollar question, with much uncertainty surrounding the destination of the R10 million prize trophy. On paper, it looks pretty straight forward as the Brazilians only need a win away at Free State Stars to defend their title at Goble Park. The Buccaneers have to win at Orlando Stadium against Polokwane City and hope Sundowns slip up at Goble Park, for them to clinch the championship. But in reality, it’s not as easy as it look with an arbitrator likely to have a final say in the title race, following the PSL’s decision to appeal a league DC sanction against Sundowns in the contentious case involving Wayne Arendse. The PSL and Sundowns were due to submit their preferred name of the arbitrator with Safa looking to finalise the matter by Friday.“This season is not the one that I am going to run around with the trophy and get excited about it, if we win,” said Mosimane, who could win the league title for the fourth time.“I don’t understand what is happening! It is unbelievable that there is one round of matches left in the season and we are still talking about this thing (DC matter).“I have already told you how I feel about this season. Last season I said it was one of those, but this season I don’t know.“I told the players to try their best and win against Stars and we will see what happens because it is beyond our control.”This is one weekend that will be stressful for Mosimane and his Pirates counterpart Milutin “Micho” Sredejovic.They will be having one eye on their game and the other in the opposition match.Cellphone messages will be the order of the day, with club spies updating their respective benches about scores between the two matches.
