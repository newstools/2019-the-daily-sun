BATHABILE  Dlamini says she has made peace with being dumped out of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s  cabinet. She was the Minister of Women before the new cabinet was announced.She also remains President of the ANC Women’s League . She told Sowetan that the decision of the president and ANC officials to equalise the number of women and men was welcome. "It is the first time in the history of this country that the decisions of the NEC for equal representation are implemented," said Dlamini. She said the ANCWL was concerned that in some provinces this NEC decision had not been adhered to, adding that the league would hold these provinces accountable. “It means that they do not understand that women play an important role in society. But also, it means they want to continue building a society [with] institutions of patriarchy and misogyny." "We fought so hard, such that when we could not get females for premiers, we said in provinces where premiers are men, women must be the majority of the executive and speakers in provincial legislatures must be women."Dlamini said the league was concerned that some provinces were disobeying this NEC resolution, promising that there would be blood on the floor, as the ANCWL would hold them accountable."
