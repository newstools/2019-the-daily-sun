TWO bloody bodies were found in Amalinda, East London, on Thursday morning. The bodies of the man and woman, aged 49 to 52, were found in Jade Street at 7.30pm. Cops said the woman was apparently on the phone in a car when her ex, a firearm in one hand and knife in the other, barged into the house. He asked the tenant where his ex was and was told she wasn’t in. The man walked outside and saw his ex getting out of a car. He allegedly shot her and then turned the gun on himself. Captain Hazel Mqala said cops and paramedics were called and the two were declared dead at the scene. “A pistol was found on the scene. A case has been opened,” she said.
