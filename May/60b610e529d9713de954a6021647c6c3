HOME Affairs will extend its office hours at their main offices to help voters who haven’t collected their IDs. This will also help those who are yet to apply and those with temporary IDs. According to Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane, front offices will be open for extended hours from 6 to 8 May between 4pm and 7pm. “This will cater for people looking to access services on these two special voting days. “It will provide any opportunity for citizens to collect their documents,” said Hlabane. He said offices will also be open on election day from 7am until 9pm when IEC voting stations close. Hlabane said people can vote when they are in possession of a smart ID card, green ID book or temporary identity certificate. Meanwhile, the department has warned members of the public against so called election robbers who present themselves as Home Affairs officials. Hlabane said the scammers do this to gain access to homes. He said the skelms arrived with of letterheads, supposedly from the department, and claimed the purpose of their visit was to confirm the validity of IDs for the elections. He said they then rob innocent victims. “We don’t come to your homes to validate IDs. You come to us for IDs and other services.”
