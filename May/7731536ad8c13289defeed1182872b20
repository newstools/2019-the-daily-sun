A
"prophet" from Tembisa is on the run after a 27-year-old woman was
raped, Gauteng police said. The
"prophet" met the woman, who is from Vusimuzi, and allegedly promised
to help her find a job by praying with her, police added When
they arrived in the woman's room, the man instructed her to fetch toilet paper,
R2, a bottle of water, a pair of scissors and a candle, police spokesperson
Captain Nelda Sekgobela added. "The
suspect cut some of the hair from the [woman's] armpit, head and private parts
with [the] scissors and told her that she must mix it together with... sperm (body
fluids) and muthi in order for her to get job," Segkobela said. The
man then proceeded to rape the victim without the use of a condom, after
convincing her that he needed to get access to her body fluids, Segkobela alleged.
He later fled on foot. She
added that other similar cases were reported in Tembisa. Sekgobela
said a rape investigation was under way. The
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL Rights Commission) has condemned the
act and urged law enforcement officials to act swiftly. "I
think it is a matter that we are very much interested in as a commission and
where it borders around issues of rape, we are prepared to draw our sister
organisation, the Commission for Gender Equality, so that we can jointly work
together in dealing with these matters," the commission's CEO Edward
Mafadza said. "As
we speak, [the culprits] are still on the streets and they may be continuing
with the same acts to other people who are not aware of what is
happening," he added. The
commission will also look into the matter if furnished with further details. Source:
