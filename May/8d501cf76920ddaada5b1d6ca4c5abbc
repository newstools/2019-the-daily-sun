IT’S sink or swim for Banyana Banyana at the Fifa Women’s World Cup. With just less than 10 days before the eighth edition of the Fifa Women’s World Cup kicks off in France, Banyana goalkeeper Andile Dlamini hopes their last friendly match against Norway will change their fortunes for the World Cup. Last year December in a draw which was in French’s, capital city Paris, Banyana were drawn in Group B against Germany who are ranked second in the World Rankings, China PR and Spain. Banyana are the lowest-ranked (49) country in their group as Spain and China are ranked 13 and 16 respectively. They will open their World Cup account with a clash against Spain in Le Havre on 8 June. But before that, Desiree Ellis’s side, who have not won a game in their recent eight preparation games where they lost five and succumbed to three draws, have a date against Norway. The fixture against The Grasshoppers is Banyana’s last chance to try and restore their pride and dignity before making the highly anticipated World Cup appearance. The game against Norway is scheduled for 2 June at Stade Moulonguet in Amiens, France (8pm SA time.) An excited Dlamini said: “With the Norway game we’re still preparing but we should show character, dig deep, get out of our comfort zone and get results.” "I cannot wait till I step my foot on the pitch for the World Cup. It feels real now, this is not just any tournament hey."
