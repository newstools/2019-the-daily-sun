SHE knew her nephew was a thug so she took him to the cops. But the police released him and now his body is lying in the mortuary. Residents attacked Kholofelo Kabelo (23) while he was waiting in the street for his friend in Tsakane extension 8 last Saturday. His aunt, Martha Menyane (60), told Daily Sun the family blamed the cops for his death. “I did nothing wrong by handing him over to the police so they could remove him from the streets.” Martha handed Kholofelo over last Thursday but he was released hours later. “I took him to the police because I wanted him to be safe. They could have locked him up and dealt with the cases opened against him,” she said. “I know people were complaining he had stolen from them and they must have opened cases.” Martha said on the day she took Kholofelo to the police station, residents wanted to grab him and she had to beg them to leave him alone. “I feel the cops failed us. We trusted them but they let us down.” Her brother was also attacked when he tried to help Kholofelo. People moered him with anything they could lay their hands on. Martha said her nephew died a very brutal death. “His head was soft from all the blows. It seemed as if all his bones were crushed,” she said. Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu of Tsakane cop shop said a case of murder was opened and cops were hunting the suspects. “They could not arrest him because no cases were opened against him. If victims had gone with him to the station and opened cases, the police wouldn’t have let him go.”
