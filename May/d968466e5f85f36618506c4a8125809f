After putting a dent on Orlando Pirates’ title hopes, Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy has offered his sincerest apologies to his former club. McCarthy masterminded the Citizens’ 2-2 draw against title chasing Bucs on Saturday, a result that handed the advantage to Mamelodi Sundowns in the race for Absa Premiership honours. Bucs are still at the top of the log standings with 54 points heading into the final game, but they could be toppled should Downs win their catch up match. The Tshwane giants take on Golden Arrows on Tuesday at Loftus Stadium (7.30pm) in the only midweek fixture. Realising that he could have cost Bucs their first title in seven years, McCarthy has asked the Bucs faithful, who used to adore him when he was banging in goals in Pirates colours during his playing days, to forgive him for being the source of their misery this time around. “I have to again sincerely apologise to Orlando Pirates that today wasn’t going to be the day where they become champions on my watch,” said McCarthy. “Polokwane City – maybe, they’ve got an opportunity to go and win their next game and then pray for the best, because games in hand don’t mean points in the bag. “Sundowns have still got to play, so anything is possible. If we did this to Pirates, the next opposition for Sundowns – Golden Arrows isn’t a walk in the park, and they’re also fighting for top eight, so it’s not going to be an easy task for Sundowns. “But they do have the upper hand now, and maybe one day the Orlando Pirates faithful can forgive me, but I’m clearly just plain and simply doing my job.”
