   BABES
Wodumo’s father, Bishop Welcome Simelane, has vowed she won’t go back to her
ex-boyfriend and alleged abuser Mampintsha. Simelane told Daily
Sun yesterday Babes was old enough to make her own decisions. “She can date an mlungu or an
Indian guy and get married to them,” he said. But he denied Babes was back in
Mampintsha’s arms. “Over my dead body! My daughter
will never go back to that man. “It’s not true. She has not gone
back to him.” When asked how he felt when Babes
recorded the video of the song Kukhona Izingane Lay’ndlini with
Mampintsha, he said: “Just because they recorded a video together doesn’t mean
they are romantically involved. “They’re working together. Their
relationship is that of colleagues, not lovers.” The People’s Paper asked him if
he still believed Mampintsha bewitched his daughter to go back to him after
attacking her, as he told the media. But he changed his tune, saying
he withdrew that statement. “This case is in court and I
can’t carry on with some of the statements. I withdraw the bewitching
statement,” he said. After the video of Babes and
Mampintsha’s song went viral last week, fans criticised her after sympathising
with her when she revealed she was abused. But Babes responded to one of her
critics on Instagram, saying in Zulu: “Ey sis naka izindaba zakho . . . uphume
ezindabeni zabantu ababili” (sister, focus on your affairs and leave the
affairs of two people alone). Mampintsha and Babes fans are
keen to know what will happen in court next Wednesday when Mampintsha appears
for allegedly assaulting Babes. This is because he’s broken one
of the bail conditions that prohibited him from being in contact with her.
