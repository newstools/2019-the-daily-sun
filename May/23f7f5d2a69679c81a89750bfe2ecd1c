DUDU Mvukelwa (50) wants to work again. Dudu used to work as a nurse at Matlala Hospital in Limpopo but she was dismissed in October 2016. The nurse from Dennilton in Limpopo claimed it all started when she had a tiff with one of the doctors in the maternity ward. She said they had a heated argument and the next thing the hospital took a blood sample and forced her into an ambulance. She was sent to a psychiatric hospital. “I was told I was crazy. Now all I want is my job back to do what I love most, which is saving lives,” she said. Neil Shikwambane, department of health spokesman, said it was true that Dudu worked at the hospital and showed signs of mental illness. He claimed she would sometimes say she was talking to a river snake while on duty. “She was then referred to a mental hospital for evaluation. She signed a treatment refusal form in October. She did not come to work for three months and that resulted in self-dismissal.”
