AFTER losing two babies, Sanyane Mcwati is terrified of having more children. The 37-year-old from Siyanqoba in Klarinet, Mpumalanga, claimed he lost his son two years ago and his daughter last year in what he believes is negligence at Witbank General Hospital. Sanyane told Daily Sun his son was stillborn after nurses refused to assist the mum while she was in labour. He claimed his daughter died when she was two months old after nurses cut the umbilical cord twice, causing an infection. “I want children but I’m scared they will die. There is no way I can risk having another child because this hospital will fail me again,” he said. “There is not a day I don’t think about them. When my six-year-old son asks me about them, it makes me cry.” Sanyane said he tried to have meetings with the hospital’s management but they sent him home, saying there was nothing they could do for him. He said he wanted the hospital to pay for the negligence. Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “Clients are encouraged to contact the hospital management for further assistance if they are not happy.”
