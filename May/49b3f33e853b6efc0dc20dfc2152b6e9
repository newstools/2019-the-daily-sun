LOSING
a child is a pain that no parent has to ever go through, because ordinarily it
is expected that a parent should be the one to depart this world first, but
what happens when a child dies first?! The pain is of course unbearable – and
nothing can heal it. This
is what singer Nhlanhla had to endure in 2009 when she lost her daughter Zina
in a car crash that happened while she was travelling with her grandmother to a
nursery school to pick up Zina’s cousins. She was only five years at the time
of her death. Now, fifteen years later, the pain has resurfaced for Nhlanhla.
In an emotionally charged Instagram post, the singer remembered her daughter,
as it would be her birthday today. “She would be 15 today, our beautiful princess Zinathi . There so much I wanna say but the words fail me. My heart is filled with so much so much pain as if it were yesterday when you left us. But in the mist of it all I, thank God for giving me the best 6 years of my life. I love you now and forever more my angel. Happy 15th birthday my Zinathi iNtsikelelo Nciza. MaRhade omhle, Ndlebentle zombini. Rest in Eternal Peace#HappyBirthdayToMySweetAngelUpAboveinTheHeavens,” she wrote on her Instagram account.  She would be 15 today, our beautiful princess Zinathi .
