GOD forbid, somebody is going to drop dead come Saturday. With these words, Steve Komphela predicted the Absa Premiership doomsday. Such is the level of competition that, as things stand, five teams are still facing the possibility of being relegated. At the top, the battle for league honours is equally astonishing. Even though Golden Arrows are safe from the dreaded axe, Komphela has predicted the hellish day for most teams. “Who is being relegated? It’s not confirmed. Who will be crowned champions? It is not confirmed… until the last minute. Nobody knows until the last day,” said Komphela. “Come Saturday, people will still be sweating. “God forbid, somebody is going to drop dead. That is the level of competition the teams face. Nobody is sleeping until Saturday. “Look at the Premiership. It is still hanging till the last match. You hit 97 points and you still can’t win the league. It’s crazy!” Komphela has done a fairly good job for Arrows since he arrived midway through the season. But for him to achieve a top-eight finish would be a cherry on top. “We are fighting for it. We have another chance and we are going for it,” said Komphela, whose side lost 2-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday. They host Bidvest Wits at Princess Magogo Stadium in their last match on Saturday (3pm). They could still make the top-eight, however, provided result elsewhere go their way. “We were on 36 points and three could have taken us to position seven. But we’ll give it a shot.” But they will need an improved performance against the Students and nothing like the first-half “horror show” against Sundowns. “I thought we had a bad start. Terrible opening ten minutes and it defined the rest of the match,” said Komphela. “I thought one mistake we made in the ten minutes of disaster was not getting close enough to them. We allowed them to penetrate with ease and we paid the price.” Komphela has also praised the PSL for the “helluva” product, which keeps growing.
