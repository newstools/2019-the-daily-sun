KIDS must know what porn is from an early age. Doctor Eve, speaking in an interview on Radio 702 on Monday morning said kids start finding out about porn from about 12 years of age. “We want to teach them about pornography ahead of the time, before they are exposed to it,” she said. This was after a Sunday paper reported that the department of education had proposed grade 4 children should learn about masturbation from next year. Doctor Eve, whose real name is Dr Marlene Wasserman, said pornography should be included in the curriculum because many children didn’t understand it. “They think this is what sexuality is about. They think that’s what healthy sex looks like. “As parents and the education department we have to talk to them about pornography as entertainment, where people are characters taking on roles. They need to be taught how to manage pornography when it does come into their lives.” However, the department has since distanced itself from the article about masturbation, saying the article has caused mass hysteria and confusion. “The article has started a debate which continues on radio talk shows and social media platforms. “The article is a complete misrepresentation of the work the department is doing,” it said. They said the new Life Orientation textbook for grade 4 pupils currently being written does not cover masturbation. SunReaders have commented on the pornography issue. Jon Bravo said: “I’m starting to believe that we are living in the end time.” Tevin Vuna said: “It’s about time. Let them teach these kids at an early age. It will be better if they had a little bit of understanding.” Ramenu Huwelelani said: “Bible study is far better than this.” Queen Esther asked: “Are there teachers trained for this?”
