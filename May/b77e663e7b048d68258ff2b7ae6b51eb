PROTEAS coach Ottis Gibson will have to plan for South Africa’s Cricket World Cup opener against England without Dale Steyn. Steyn is still battling to recover from a shoulder injury and has been ruled out of the keenly-awaited duel at The Oval on Thursday. Yet this development would have come as no shock to Ottis, who confirmed the veteran bowler has not made a satisfactory recovery to feature in the opening match. “He is not quite ready, not far away but he is not ready yet,” said Ottis. “We think with a six-week tournament there is no real need to force the issue right now. So he won’t be available for the first match. “We know that he is close and is getting closer every day. “We will give him as much time as we can for him to get ready. We are hoping that he will be ready on Sunday against Bangladesh, but if not, then against India. Reiterating Steyn’s importance last week, Gibson said: “He’s an important part of our setup and of our strategy.“ The strategy is not for just the first week, but for the whole six weeks. If he’s not able to play a part in the first week, but is able to play in the latter stages of the tournament, then that’s something we are able to accept.”
