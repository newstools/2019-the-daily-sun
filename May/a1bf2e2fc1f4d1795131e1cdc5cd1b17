Two men died and two others injured a multi vehicle crash,
on the N17 between Bethal and Ermelo. The three vehicles were found scattered along the road. ER24 spokesman, Russel Meiring said on closer inspection,
paramedics found the body of a man lying trapped in one of the light motor
vehicles. “Unfortunately, the man had already succumbed to his
injuries. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead,” he said.  “A driver of one of the trucks, a man, was found lying
trapped inside the cab of his vehicle. Ermelo Fire Services had to use the
jaws-of-life equipment to free the man from the wreckage. Once freed, the man
was treated and provided with advanced life support interventions,” he added. Meiring said after some time, the man’s vital signs rapidly weakened.  He said CPR and further advanced life support interventions
were initiated, in an effort to revive the patient. “Unfortunately, the man succumbed to his injuries. Two other
patients, both with minor injuries, were treated and transported to nearby
hospitals for further care. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known,”
said Meiring.
