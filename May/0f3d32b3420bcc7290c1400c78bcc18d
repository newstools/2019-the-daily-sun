A FAMILY are still in the dark following a shocking discovery. Mzonhlanhla Mthembu (33) from
KwaMancinza, north of Durban, woke up on Monday morning to find his brother
Bheka (39) hanging from an avocado tree outside their home. Mzonhlanhla said he was sad and
confused that his brother didn’t leave a suicide note. “I woke up at 5am to pee. When I
looked at the tree, I noticed there was something hanging from it. “I went closer and was shocked
when I saw my brother,” he said. He then woke up his two other
brothers. “We panicked and shook him as we
thought he was perhaps still alive. But he was already dead. We called the
cops,” he said. Mzonhlanhla said cops searched
Bheka’s pockets to check if there was a note, but there was nothing. “We also checked his cellphone
and the last message he sent was to his girlfriend earlier on Sunday, telling
her he would see her later,” said Mzonhlanhla. He said they suspected
Mzonhlanhla killed himself after money disappeared from his bank account. “He worked as a gardener after
being unemployed for several years. “He was excited and had promised
his three children he’d buy them clothes and give his girlfriend some money,”
he said. But on Thursday he told
Mzonhlanhla money had disappeared from his bank account, and he was only left
with R150. “He was hurt but tried not to
show it. I think he felt hopeless as he couldn’t keep the promises he made to
his children and girlfriend and decided to end his life,” said Mzonhlanhla. KZN police spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was opened at Ntuzuma
cop shop.
