THE DA took its election campaign to the doorstep of the ANC. Election messages were put on a digital billboard at Luthuli House in Joburg. Some of the messages that popped up included “let’s grow corruption together”, “the ANC is dead” and “we need change”. DA spokesman Solly Malatsi said they bought advertising space on the billboard to show people that corruption started at Luthuli House. “We believe the digital billboard complies with all the electoral campaigning regulations formalised by the IEC,” he said. Responding to the advert, ANC head of elections Fikile Mbalula wrote on Twitter: “You’re being childish. There is nothing wrong with accusing the ANC of corruption, but when you laser our offices and march to our offices, it’s wrong. “You want to disrupt this election. We won’t give you what you want, which is disruption.” While Mbalula took the matter seriously, other social media users found it funny. Many said the DA was just being creative and there was nothing wrong with the advert. “They caught you napping as you forgot technology is advanced. We are no longer stuck in 1994.”
