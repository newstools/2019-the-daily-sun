With top flight football currently on a break, 5-a-side teams took it upon themselves to entertain many football lovers in the Africa 5s National Finals held at Action Sports in Centurion on Saturday. Orlando Pirates successfully defended their Castle Africa 5’s national title while the Drama Queens walked away with the honours in the female division. Pirates (Gauteng) beat Bekezela (Port Elizabeth) FC 7-4 in the finals while Drama Queens edged Chilli Sauce 4-3 in the women’s final. Both teams will now represent Mzansi in the continental championship set to be staged in Tanzania from 6 - 9 June. The overall winners will then win a trip to Europe with former Barcelona and Cameroon legend Samuel Eto’o. Last year’s winners were rewarded with a trip to the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia, this year, the winners are likely to travel to either Spain, England or Italy. Orlando Pirates captain, Jose Garcia, said they were looking forward to testing themselves against the best 5-a-side teams in the continent in Tanzania. “We are excited, the guys won it last year in Zambia so we are hoping to repeat the feat,” said Garcia. “We know it won’t be easy, we just need to prepare well and give it our best shot.” Matthew Booth, who is the brand ambassador, is also hopeful Pirates will once again triumph at the continental five-a-side finals in Tanzania. “Ambassadors for the other countries are already talking about us, saying we can’t beat them on this occasion. There is a bit of rivalry growing there and I’m looking forward to taking the SA team to Tanzania,” said the former Bafana Bafana defender.
