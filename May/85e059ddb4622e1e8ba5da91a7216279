The national men's 4x400m team coasted into the A final with a solid performance, leading the way for the South African squad on Day 1 of the IAAF World Relays in Yokohama, Japan on Saturday. The 4x400m quartet, consisting of Gardeo Isaacs, Ranti Dikgale, Pieter Conradie and Ashley Hlungwani, took second place in their heat in 3:02.77, keeping their medal hopes alive. They are set to compete in the A final on Sunday's second and final day of competition. The SA men's 4x100m team of Emile Erasmus, Simon Magakwe, Anaso Jobodwana and Akani Simbine - finished fourth in their heat in 38.66, missing out on the A final by 0.15. There is no B final in the 4x100m, so they were automatically eliminated from competition. The SA women's 4x100m team did not finish their heat and they were also eliminated, while the national men's 4x200m side are scheduled to compete in the heats of their event on Sunday. Both the 100 m men Relay and 400 m men Relay qualify for IAAF World Championships in Doha in September.
