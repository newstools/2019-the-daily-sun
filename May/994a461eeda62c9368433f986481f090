THERE are a lot of activities at Baroka FC – GOOD and BAD! With Ntshumayelo, his football career has again taken a bad knock and looks like his holiday in Polokwane could be over for the 29-year-old. His three months deal with the Limpopo outfit has collapsed and, by the look of things, the club will not be exercising their option to renew his deal for two more years. Mphahlele added that they will not be dismantling the entire Baroka empire especially after surviving the relegation scare on the last day of the 2018-19 season, has left the final decisions of many of their plans ahead on coach Wedson Nyirenda. “He will make the call,” said Mphahlele. The Bakgaga players are expected back in camp on 10 June for pre-season, and this is where Nyirenda will assess them and submit the final recommendations on who will go and who will stay. “Despite finishing in position 14, we did not have a bad season at all. My boys did well and those who did well will stay,” Mphahlele said. Nyirenda was left frustrated with Ntshumayelo’s engine that failed to ignite when he needed him the most, as he was expected to play a big role. Ntshumayelo made one appearance throughout his stay at Baroka, a match they lost 2-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns on 20 April. Our mole at Baroka has also alleged that Nyirenda has had enough of Ntshumayelo’s attitude and behaviour. Said our mole: “Things got worse because he had been in unscrupulous adventures with some of the senior players is his five months stay with the club. “He further had a fall-out with team manager Lawrence Okwara ahead of Baroka’s last league game against Maritzburg United. “Okwara requested the 18 players who made a cut of the match day squad to hand over their cellphones before the crucial game, but Bibo refused and was dropped from the squad a day before the match.”
