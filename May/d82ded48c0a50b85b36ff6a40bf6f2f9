DYLAN Kerr is uncertain about his future with Black Leopards. This is despite the fact that the Englishman has achieved his mandate of helping the Limpopo outfit avoid relegation when they beat Benni McCarthy’s Cape Town City 1-0 in their last Absa Premiership game of the season at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday. Kerr joined Lidoda Duvha last year in December to succeed Joel Masutha. His mandate was to retain Leopards’ PSL status. But Kerr, whom Leopards fans have fallen in love with in his six months with Lidoda Duvha, is not yet sure if the Thidielas would retain him for next season. “I have not spoken to anybody about my future, and nobody has asked me anything,” said Kerr. “I have not been approached and neither has my agent and my advisor. I will have to sit down with the club chairman David Thidiela and see what his visions are for next year. This year’s mandate was to stay in the PSL and we have achieved that. “Now we have to think outside of the box and look for quality players.” Kerr will be out of the country next month in Belfast, Northern Ireland’s capital to attend coaching courses. Despite rumours linking him to relegated outfit Free State Stars, Kerr said he would love to continue as Leopards head coach. “Who wouldn’t want to be here?” asked Kerr “I love this place and the fans. We went seven games without a win, but the fans have been supportive. “They would always stop me for pictures every time I meet them at shopping centres. For me it shows that I am doing a good job. I love it here.”
