FOREIGN shop owners in Middelburg, Mpumalanga are fed up with what they say is criminal behaviour by police in the area. They claim the police come to their shops and force them to close their doors earlier than normal trading hours. A shop owner said a certain police officer always comes and forces them to close their shops earlier than usual and later demands bribes. “Our shops are next to the taxi rank and people knock off at about 5pm, and that’s when our shops get really busy,” he said. “We pay rent at the end of the month and we have families to feed. “We’ve never seen any law that says we must close our business premises at 4pm. We don’t know what we’ve done to deserve such treatment.” Earlier this year, foreigners living in Khumbula, outside KaBokweni, told Daily Sun they were tired of paying “protection fees” to the local police. They alleged that since 2017, they have been paying this fee. The tjotjo, they say, is to protect them from criminals. But instead they have become victims of crime. Police officers also allegedlypretend to be conducting inspections in the foreigners’ shops. During the “inspections”, the foreigners said the police accused them of selling expired food and then demanding money. The foreign shop owners said initially they were convinced there was such a fee. That was until they noticed that the police visits were too frequent. And with each visit, they demanded protection money, usually R500, from each shop owner. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said they were not aware of the allegations. Hlathi asked the victims of this act to take the matter to the Middelburg police management.
