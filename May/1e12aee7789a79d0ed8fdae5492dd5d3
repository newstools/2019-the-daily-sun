THOBILE Dludla (33) regrets treating the injuries of the woman who crashed into her shack as more important than her own loss. Thobile from KwaMancinza, north of Durban, told Daily Sun last month a woman lost control of her car after the brakes failed. She crashed into the shack Thobile ws renting. “The car damaged my TV, fridge and bed,” she said. “My sister had a minor injury but I wasn’t harmed. “The woman was in shock and I thought she might have sustained internal injuries and should be rushed to hospital.” She said they exchanged contact details, and the next day the woman promised to come back to see the damage so she could pay Thobile. “But she didn’t come and now she doesn’t answer my calls,” she said. “The owner of the shack spoke to the woman and they made arrangements for her to pay for the shack, but I’m worried about my things. “ wish I hadn’t felt sorry for her because maybe she would’ve paid for my things.” The car owner, Nonhlanhla Maphumulo said she won’t pay for Thobile’s belongings. “On the day of the crash I checked and nothing in the shack was damaged.” She said she will pay for the shack and nothing else.
