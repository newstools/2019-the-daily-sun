MMUSI Maimane visited the church in Bloemfontein where the ANC was founded in 1912. “I am here today to say that this is no longer the movement of Nelson Mandela,” said the DA leader at the Waaihoek Wesleyan Church yesterday. “Today we are here to say what is left of the ANC only has the interests of those who are connected inside the ANC. “It has become a criminal syndicate, a party where people are looting money.” He said the ruling party was a Gupta and Bosasa movement. “It stole VBS money from the poorest people of South Africa.” He said the struggle today is a struggle for jobs. According to Maimane, his party wants to eradicate corruption in all areas of government. He said those who are corrupt should be jailed for 15 years as citizens needed to be saved and protected. “Ultimately Cyril Ramaphosa is part of the movement. He benefited from Bosasa,” he said. “The Free State is a failing state. There is no health care and no safety there.” DA Free State premier candidate Patricia Kopane said the DA is the only party that is growing. “We are confident we will bring change to South Africa and the Free State. The people of Free State are tired of corruption.”
