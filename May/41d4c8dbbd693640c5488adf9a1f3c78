THE families of three trapped Lily Mine workers near Barberton, Mpumalanga, have opened a culpable homicide case against the mine. Pretty Nkambule, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyirenda were buried underground three years ago. It happened when the container they were working in caved in underground. According to Elmon Mnisi (65), Yvonne’s father, the department of mineral resources was expected to open a case after concluding its inquiry in March last year but did not. He said it only handed a report to the NPA in August last year, which had recommendations for prosecution. Mnisi said they opened the case against the mine as the directors had been playing hard to get since the completion of the inquiry. “We couldn’t wait for people who’re failing us. We’re not taken seriously, and that’s why we decided to do it ourselves. The only thing we want are the remains of our children, which will be made possible by the mine owners.” Mnisi said he hoped they will be taken seriously now. Former workers and some family members have been camping outside the mine since last Tuesday, holding prayer sessions. Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said the families opened a case against the mine at Low’s Creek cop shop.
