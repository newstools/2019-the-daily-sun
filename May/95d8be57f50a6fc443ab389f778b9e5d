 A man is
fighting for his life after being crushed by a tipper truck. The crash
happened on the R103 in Camperdown, KwaZulu Natal. ER24
spokesman Werner Vermaak said paramedics arrived on the scene this morning to
find a large truck lying on its side on the side of the road. Vermaak
said a small bakkie was found lying partially beneath part of the truck and its
load of sand. “On closer
inspection, paramedics found the driver of the bakkie, a man in his 30s, lying
trapped inside his vehicle,” said Vermaak. “Assessments
showed that the man was in a critical condition, rescue services had to use
specialized tool to free the man from the vehicle,” he added. He said
once freed, he was treated for his injuries and provided with several advanced
life support interventions. “After
treatment, the man was airlifted by a private medical helicopter to a nearby
hospital. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations,” said
Vermaak.
