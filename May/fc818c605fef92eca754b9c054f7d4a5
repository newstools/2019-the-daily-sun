WHY fit it if it’s not broken? That is the attitute applied by Netball South Africa (NSA) president Cecilia Molokwane as she announced Team SA for the INF World Cup in England on 12-21 July. There are four pools that will play in the preliminary rounds and the Proteas have been pitted with Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobacco and Fiji in Group C. Their opening game is against Tobacco on 12 July. These are exciting times for netball in the country as sponsorship seems to be booming, unlike in other codes. But the mandate for national team coach, Norma Plummer, and her squad is to come back home with gold medals hanging on their neck. Molokwane feels that the Proteas are sending their golden generation and stand a better chance of securing a podium finish for the first time since 1995. The issues of bonuses and how much the team stand to pocket, should they do well, will be announced at their send-off function on the eve of their departure to Europe on 26 June. “The team is not broken and the coach has decided to stick with the tried and tested, and we support her all the way,” Molokwane said. “It was not difficult to pick up this team as the coach understood what is her mandate. Most of the players played at the Quad Series in Liverpool in January. We have a squad that can win us gold.” The Proteas will feature in warm-up matches against Wales as part their preparations for the biggest netball spectacle in the world. Molokwane added: “We have given Plummer everything that she needs and we expect her to deliver, no excuses.” Mzansi will be handed the baton to host the 2023 World Cup by England on 21 July. THE SQUAD Lenize Potgieter, Ine-Marie Venter, Maryka Holtzhausen, Renske Stoltz, Erin Burger, Izette, Griesel, Khanyisa Chawane, Bongiwe Msomi (captain), Shadine van der Merwe, Karla Pretorius.
