THE offices of the South African Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector conducted a joint inspection in Alexandra on Friday to observe the state of the area. This was part of the investigation into the Alexandra Renewal Project and other service delivery issues that led to the Alex shutdown last month. The Public Protector’s office will tackle mismanagement issues, while the commission will provide lasting solutions to ensure an improved quality of life for Alex residents. Led by the leaders of the shutdown, they visited sites that showed lack of service delivery. These included illegal structures next to river banks, the cemetery, piles of illegal dumping and hostels. According to the team, after the inspection a final report will released. The commission’s Harriette Buga said: “The inspection is here to see and observe the challenges faced by people of Alexandra. This will be followed by oral and written submissions from residents next week. These will form part of our report.” Other government departments gave their side of the story into service delivery. Shutdown member, Thandiwe Mthombeni, said: “We’re showing them sites of concern that led to the protests. We want things to happen. If nothing happens, there’ll be another shutdown.” Thandiwe said following a meeting they had with the ministerial team on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s instructions, they were still waiting for feedback. She said after Ramaphosa’s visit, waste collection resumed, but more still needed to be done. “We handed over the memorandum and are waiting to see things start moving,” said Thandiwe.
