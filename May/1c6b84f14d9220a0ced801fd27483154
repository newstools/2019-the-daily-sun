GOGO Matlhodi Ndlovu celebrated her 100th birthday with family and friends. The party was held at her home in Majaneng, Hammanskraal, on Saturday. Gogo’s family told Daily Sun Matlhodi is their role model. Her son Hendrick (78) said: “My mother is a Christian. “She’s against alcohol. She still cooks, cleans house, sews and knits.” Matlhodi’s granddaughter Portia Mthimunye (38) said they were grateful to God they still have their gogo around. “All of us in the family were raised by her. She was a domestic worker for almost 35 years. She never bought any clothes for us but sewed them herself,” she said. “She also sold chips and socks to put food on the table for her family.” Portia said her gogo liked eating pap and vegetables and often woke up very early in the morning to exercise. “My gogo leads a healthy life and she’s still strong.” She said gogo Matlhodi would warn them against eating too much meat as it was not good for their health. “And she used to beat us whenever she saw as playing with boys. She believed it wasn’t good or safe,” said Portia. Gogo has been blessed with nine kids, 31 grandchildren, 38 great-grandkids and 21 great-great grandchildren.
