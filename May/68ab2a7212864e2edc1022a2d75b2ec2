The South African National Defense Force wants it to be known that their parachutists who crashed landed during President Cyril Ramaphosa's R100-million inauguration is okay. While Saturday was supposed to be about Ramaphosa "phakaming" the SANDF parachutist came down harder than Malema's vosho and crashed Ramaphosa's big day. The landing landed the parachutist on top of the Twitter trends list. After the incidents, there were many reports about the parachutist being in ICU making rounds on social media. The SANDF dismissed these claims. "The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is concerned about inaccurate news currently making rounds on different social media platforms about the parachute incident which happened during the Presidential Inauguration. The SANDF can confirm that the member received medical attention at the stadium and released. The reports on social media platforms that the member is in the Intensive Care Unit are not true," the SANDF said in a statement.
