The Mzansi Kwaito and House Music Awards honour artists who hold the torch for these two genres. The event, in its fourth year, will take place on 30 November at Carnival City’s Big Top Arena in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, for the second year in a row. Perfecta Khumalo, founder and CEO of the awards, said the event will be bigger and better this year. She said the organisers took pride in providing a platform to unearth up-and-coming musical talent. Perfecta said they wanted to contribute to the success of kwaito and house music in South Africa. She encouraged all artists who have released music in the past year to submit their entries as it was an opportunity of a lifetime “Please read the rules and regulations before you fill in a form.” She said one of the notable changes this year was that apart from the winners, up-and-coming artists would receive prizes if they were runners-up in any category. “This is exciting,” she said. “We have so many surprises which is why we say #ZizowaMore,” said Perfecta. A total of 19 categories have been confirmed. The organisers will embark on a nationwide tour to search for young talent. Aspiring artists will be given a platform to perform with the cream of the crop in the industry. Previous winners include Mshoza, Mandoza, Busisiwa, Spikiri and Drencko. The nomination submissions opened yesterday and will close on 31 July. The nominees will be announced on 30 August and voting lines open on the same day. The voting lines close on  3 November.
