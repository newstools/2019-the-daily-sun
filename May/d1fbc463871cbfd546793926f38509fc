AN ACCIDENT on Saturday left residents scratching their heads. They had no idea what could have led to a car suddenly veering off the M25 in Indanda, north of Durban. It hit two children on the pavement before rolling several times. After the driver knocked into a street pole and the kids, aged six and eight, the car rolled and landed in a nearby playground. The driver, Sithembiso Zulu (37), died. A 47-year-old witness said she was washing her clothes at a tap near the road when she saw a car speeding down the road. “After the accident, I saw the driver was bleeding terribly. He died on the spot,” she said. Njabulo Mchunu (33) said he thought the children were dead but when he went to check on them, he realised they had only sustained minor injuries. Residents said the children were not from the area and were there to play soccer. Rescue Care Paramedics spokesman, Garrith Jamieson, said nothing could be done to save the driver. “Unfortunately, the driver had succumbed to his injuries and nothing could be done. He was declared dead on the scene,” he said. “The two children sustained moderate injuries and were treated immediately.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was opened. “The driver died at the scene and the other victims were lightly injured.”
