AFTER he buried his wife last year, he felt a part of him was missing. He booked the grave next to his beloved so they could rest side by side one day. But Lesley Mogale (67) from Kgabalatsane, North West, got the shock of his life last week when he visited the grave and found a photo of a woman on it. The picture had stones, candles and containers of snuff around it. “It looked as if people were visiting my grave regularly and cleaning it. “I don’t know what the meaning of this is. “I can’t sleep at night because I don’t know who the people are and what they want from me.” Lesley said all he wanted was to be buried next to his wife. “I want to be peacefully buried next to her so I can talk to her,” he said. Lesley said he reported the matter to the office where he registered his grave, but no one knew what was going on. Cemetery bookkeeper Lawrence Chauke said the woman was not on the list of people buried at the cemetery. “There is no sign that this woman was buried here,” he said. “Her family must have lost her grave and put the picture here.” Chauke said he’d look for the family and make enquiries.
