WHILE most people were celebrating Workers’ Day, the Seoloanas suffered a massive loss. Cousins Mahlaku (10) and Morongwa (17) drowned in an open pit after trying to reach a container they had dropped into the water. The open pit in Matebeleng Village, outside Mokopane in Limpopo, was apparently left by a brick company that was mining soil. Mahlaku’s mum Mable (29) said it was hard for her to accept the death of her child. “She was in grade 3 and we were hoping that she’d one day complete matric and go to university,” she said. Morongwa’s brother Cry Gololo (29) said it was tragic that she died while trying to get water. “We don’t have regular water supply here, and the municipality has not sent a tanker as it’s an isolated area. We’re forced to get water from that open pit,” he said. “We are so hurt as they were both still young.” Cry said his family didn’t have the money to bury the girls and pleaded for help. Mogalakwena municipal spokesman Malesela Selokela said they would help with the funeral arrangements.
