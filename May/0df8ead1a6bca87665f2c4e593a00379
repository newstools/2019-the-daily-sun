THE DA in Nelson Mandela Bay yesterday celebrated after retaining two wards in a by-election. The wards in the Northern Areas were contested by the DA, ANC, ACDP, Patriotic Alliance and Socialist Revolutionary Workers’ Party. Helga van Staaden won in ward 35 with 83,3% of the vote, while Georgina Faldtman won in ward 37 with 55,4%. The wards became vacant in December after the Port Elizabeth High Court ruled Trevor Louw and Neville Higgins were no longer DA councillors after the party expelled them. DA provincial leader Nqaba Bhanga said: “This was an endorsement by voters that they want the DA to govern the metro once more. “Under the ANC, EFF and UDM coalition of corruption, service delivery, especially in the Northern Areas, has come to a virtual standstill. “Residents have suffered long enough under the coalition of corruption and we are confident a DA-led government will shortly return to power.” The DA lost control of the council last year after councillors turned against the party and voted with the current coalition. ANC councillor Andile Lungisa said: “Yes, we lost in both wards but won two voting stations. We salute our volunteers who worked hard.”
