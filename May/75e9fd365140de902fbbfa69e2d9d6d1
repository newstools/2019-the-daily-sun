A school bus driver has been bust after two pupils were killed and 40 others injured on Tuesday. The 47-year-old driver has been charged with culpable homicide. The bus he was driving overturned in Groot Marico, near Zeerust in the North West. According to police spokesman Captain Sam Tselanyane, the bus was ferrying pupils from Doornlaagte to Groot Marico. He said the driver allegedly stopped near the N4 road to run after a hitchhiker who had boarded the bus without paying. “After the driver got out of the bus, it rolled back until it fell on its side,” he said. Tselanyane said the teenage victims were trapped in the bus and two subsequently died. “The bus was allegedly loaded with 49 pupils from Thuto Ke Maatla Comprehensive School and Phenyobutle Primary School,” he said Tselanyane said the driver will appear in the Lehurutshe Magistrates Court soon. North West Education spokesman Freddy Sepeng said: “All 40 pupils were taken to the local hospital for medical treatment and only one is still in hospital, while 19 were discharged on the same day.”
