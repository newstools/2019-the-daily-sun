ANC VETERANS are asking those implicated in scandals to withdraw their nominations for parliament. ANC Veterans League president Snuki Zikalala told Daily Sun they ran workshops in different provinces, where the resolution was made. “As veterans, we had election workshops in Gauteng, Eastern Cape and North West. “Veterans in these provinces decided not to allow those implicated in corrupt activities, unethical behaviour and lies under oath to be included in the cabinet. “We are humbly requesting they withdraw their nominations to parliament.” Zikalala said: “We will definitely support a trimmed cabinet with fewer or no deputy ministers. “We would like to see a competent and trimmed cabinet that will deliver on the people’s mandate.” He pleaded with President Cyril Ramaphosa to select the right people for the job, by choosing a smaller cabinet led by skilled, committed, dedicated, passionate and ethical leaders to serve the country. The first sitting of the National Assembly, as declared by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, will take place on Wednesday, where Mogoeng will swear in designated members. Once sworn in, the members will elect the Speaker and deputy speaker. This will then be followed by the election of the president of the country, followed by the first sitting of the National Council of Provinces on Thursday. Of the 48 political parties that contested the election, only 14 qualified for representation in the National Assembly. Asked which members the league thought should not be allowed anywhere near parliament, Zikalala said he was unable to mention names, as the integrity commission has not yet pronounced on those found to be wanting. He said he was unable to comment on the mergers and the reconfiguration of the cabinet as the presidency was still busy with the process.
