 Four
people, including a 10-year-old girl, were injured this afternoon. This is
after a light motor vehicle collided with a truck on the N12 between Fochville
and Westonaria. The ER24
spokesman Ross Campbell said paramedics arrived just after 12 pm to find the
four injured already being assessed by other services on the scene. Campbell
said two people, a male and female believed to be the parents, had already been
transported to a hospital in the area. "The
10-year-old girl was found to have suffered moderate injuries, while a
seriously injured 20-year-old female required Advanced Life Support
interventions before both were taken to a private hospital in
Randfontein," said Campbell. Campbell
said the Fire and Traffic departments were on the scene for further
investigations.
