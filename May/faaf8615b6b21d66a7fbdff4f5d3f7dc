CHIPPA United’s hopes of ditching the relegation axe received a huge boost, with four of their star players returning from injuries and a suspension respectively. Thabo Rakhale, Andile Mbenyane, Frederic Nsabiyumva are back from an assortment of injuries, while Boikanyo Komane missed the Chilli Boys’s 3-1 win against Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership encounter on Saturday due to suspension. Chippa host Kaizer Chiefs in a must-win league match at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (3pm). “These players are going to be available for the Chiefs game at the weekend,” said Chippa coach Clinton Larsen. “I am going to have a nice selection headache for our last game. It is a good thing to have all your players going into such a big game.” Chippa are currently 13th on the log with 27 points, equal with Black Leopards and Free State Stars, who are below them and fighting for their lives. Larsen knows victory is vital against the Soweto giants as a win for all three teams – Leopards, Stars and Maritzburg – could see the Port Elizabeth-based side drop to the National First Division (NFD).
