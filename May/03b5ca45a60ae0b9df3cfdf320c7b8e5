The source said they started noticing in September that ARVs were always missing. “We used to find boxes hidden in the building. “But investigations went nowhere which made to us suspect other officials knew what was going on.” She said they found boxes from Ingwavuma and Obonjeni hospitals. She said as a district official, the suspect has access to all hospitals in the district. Another source said the man was believed to be working with local druglords. He said the man used to be seen at Delunina in Jozini, where whoonga addicts live. “We heard ARVs are processed to produce drugs. We suspect the man is selling them to drug smugglers,” the source said. Police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the arrest but said the docket was sent to a senior public prosecutor for a decision. Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the department was investigating. She wouldn’t comment on the arrest because the matter is in police hands.
