EIGHT hot spots in the North West have been identified as the country heads towards national elections. National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole was briefing the media on the state of security readiness for the national elections tomorrow. Sitole said serious stabilisation will be conducted in the eight areas identified.  However, he said the areas will not be named not scare the criminals away as the intention is to make arrests. The only hint was the hotspots could be identified with heavy security presence.  "In this province from an intelligence perspective we have identified the top eight hotspots. And in those hotspots, we have got stabilisation interventions which means over and above the elections we've got deployments that are looking at stabilising those crimes," Sithole said. The National Commissioner said the level of planning and resources provided will bring positive results.  A total of 84 000 security officials have been deployed nationally. While the North West received more than 5000 deployed officials, including the Defense Force on standby. As an added security measure, a fleet of vehicles were also handed over to the police. More security will be deployed to also secure Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials. "Up to this far since we started with the state of readiness for the elections, there has not been much of serious incidents. â€œAnd we are continuing to create the confidence of the communities and make sure they are level of fear goes down because of the heavy police presence," said the Commissioner.
