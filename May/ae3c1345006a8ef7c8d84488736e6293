SA under-20 national men’s team assistant coach Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele believes they are ready to compete at the fast approaching Fifa U-20 World Cup. The biennial football world championship, set to be staged in Poland, will kick off on Thursday and will last until 15 June. Amajita have been drawn in Group F alongside Argentina, Korea Republic and Portugal. They will get their campaign up and running when they lock horns with Argentina at the Tychy Stadium on Saturday (8pm SA Time). The SA juniors are now at the final stages of their preparations for the tournament, where they will be making their second consecutive appearance and their fourth in total. They have played five friendly matches against teams that will also be at the World Cup in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Panama and Ukraine as they gear up for the tournament. They won two, lost two and drew one of the five matches, the most recent against Ukraine at the Bannikov Stadium in Kyiv, Ukraine on Saturday which ended in a 1-1 draw. Mkhalele, who has been holding the fort for Amajita while Coach Thabo Senong has been away on compassionate leave, believes these friendly matches have given them a taste of what to expect at the World Cup. “We are very fortunate to have played against sides who will also be competing in the World Cup,” said Mkhalele. “This helped us to gauge our preparedness for the tournament in the past few weeks we have been in camp and we are truly grateful to Safa for that. “The team is has now adapted to the way we want them to play in the tournament.”
