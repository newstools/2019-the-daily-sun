A WOMAN was killed and five others injured when the vehicle they were travelling in veered off the road and landed in the Umsindusi River. The incident happened on Tuesday at about 4am near Commercial Road in Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said: “A light motor vehicle was found in the middle of the river. Three of the six occupants were found seated on the river bank.” He said the other three occupants were pulled out of the car but one of them was already dead. “A woman believed to be in her 20s had already died from her injuries in the car. She was declared dead at the scene,” he said. Meiring said the other occupants were assessed and found to have sustained moderate injuries. “The patients were treated and then taken to nearby hospitals for further care.” He said while the medics were still at the scene, another car landed in the river 10 metres away. Meiring said paramedics found a man found at this accident was already dead. “The details surrounding the second incident are not yet known,” said Meiring. KZN police spokesman Liutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A case of culpable homicide and an inquest docket were opened for investigation at Mountain Rise cop shop.”
