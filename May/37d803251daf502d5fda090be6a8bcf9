LERATO Mtheku couldn’t wait to hold her second baby in her arms when she went to give birth. However, what was supposed to be a time of joy turned to misery when the baby was stillborn. To make matters worse, the 28-year-old from Elandskop in Pietermaritzburg claimed doctors at Edendale Hospital removed her womb without her permission. She told Daily Sun she wanted compensation from the KZN Department of Health. “I arrived at the hospital at about 7am on 18 January after feeling serious labour pains at home. “Instead of allocating me a bed in the labour ward, they sent me to Edendale Clinic for urine and blood pressure tests,” she said. “When I got there, the nurses checked me and told me I needed to go back to hospital.” Lerato said at noon, the nurses at the hospital gave her a pill to help her deliver. “They then ignored me until 11pm. “I remember them saying they couldn’t feel the heartbeat of my baby and then I lost consciousness,” she said. Lerato said the next day, she discovered her baby had died and her womb was gone. “I feel as if they let me down. They are responsible for the death of my baby. I don’t think my baby would have died if they had attended to me,” she said. “The womb issue makes me angrier because I’m too young to be told I won’t be able to have kids anymore. “I want compensation for this. They told me they had to remove it because I was bleeding heavily.” Spokeswoman for the KZN Department of Health, Ncumisa Mafunda, said: “Pregnancy and the expected arrival of a new baby always brings with it joy and excitement. “A result that is contrary to that can be very painful and difficult to accept. “The department wishes to express its sympathy to the mother and her family. The department is concerned about this matter, and confirm that it is under investigation.”
