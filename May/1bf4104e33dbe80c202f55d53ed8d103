 DESPITE great financial difficulty, the annual Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) Games swing back into the action this weekend. The expansion of the event over the last 19 years has meant Phiri has to go knocking on corporate SA doors with cap in hand begging for funds. Phiri launched the 2019 edition of the popular kasi winter tournament in Alexandra this week. “Funding is a big challenge. Every year we go door to door asking for funding. We do get promises for funds but promises are not always kept, ” said Phiri. “But we are grateful for the likes of Khurishi Mphahlele of Baroka FC who is sponsoring us. There are many other good Samaritans who help us stage the tournament. We have also signed with MonFlair, the technical sponsor. They will be dressing the kids. “However, we don’t rest on our laurels. After each tournament we take a month’s break or so before we start planning for next one.” As ever Phiri, a member of the Bafana Bafana 1998 World Cup team, is looking forward to another successful MAP tournament. The draw for the Under 13, 15, 17 and 19 was conducted on Tuesday. The juniors tourney starts on Saturday. The matches take place every weekend leading up to the final on 16 June. “This year we are motivating the young ones with the individual awards. Before we used to award winners with trophies, but this year we are going an extra mile, ” said Phiri. The seniors categories will commence henceforth with the pre-rounds. The final will be on 22 July.
