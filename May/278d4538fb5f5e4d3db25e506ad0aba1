THE general consensus is that Percy Tau is too good for an obscure second tier league in Belgium. And you will be hard-pressed to find anyone who argues otherwise. As if to reinforce an already known fact, the enterprising Bafana Bafana star this week scooped the Player of the Season in the Belgian second division where he starred for Saint-Gilloise. His former coach, Pitso Mosimane, has led chorus for Tau either return to his English Premiership parent-club, Brighton Albion & Hove, or move to a more visible league in Europe. “Can’t he go to La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A? The boy is a top player,” exclaimed Mosimane. “I think Percy could have done much better in the Caf Champions League. He could have won African Player of the Year and get a big transfer to Villareal, Valencia, Milan… that is where he must play. "I am happy that Percy went to Europe because he wanted to go to Europe and he went to prove that he can play football in Europe. But like many, Mosimane is also wondering.“What is he doing there?” he asked. “If Percy doesn’t get to the English Premier League‚ then I don’t know. Maybe the media must put pressure so they give him the work permit.”
