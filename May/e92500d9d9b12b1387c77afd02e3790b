HE is not afraid to brag about his achievements on social media, even though he sometimes gets trolled for it, but that doesn’t deter rap star Cassper Nyovest. To add to his long list of achievements, the star shared some good news with his more than two million fans – he has a new “bid deal”. He recently tweeted that he had once declined a 300k offer, because he valued “relationships more”. But, surprisingly he advised upcoming artists trying to make money that they shouldn’t believe the twitter savage life, because “it’s a lie”. The star tweeted: “To up and coming artists tryna make a lot of money from the industry. Don't believe the twitter savage life, its a lie. A clean brand is most likely to get deals from brands than a hooligan. Bagged another TV advert and this one I really cant wait to shoot. BIG BAGS ONLY! BOSS!”
