Mpumalanga Agriculture MEC Vusi Shongwe encouraged communities to use any available land around their houses to grow crops. Any surplus produce could be sold, he said He was addressing the community of Wesselton, near Ermelo on Friday during the launch of the Zonda Indlala programme. Shongwe said even though unemployment remained a problem, people should consider using their land for agricultural purposes. “Plant fruit trees for food security so you can make a living, prevent soil erosion and contribute to a clean environment. “Use available land to fight poverty through agriculture,” he said. The department will plant trees across the province, especially in rural communities, to provide shade and encourage people to fight poverty.
