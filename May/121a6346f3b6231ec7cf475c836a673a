Your handbag carries literally your whole life. Now for some people, myself included, we can get a bit
carried away with what we put in our handbags. If your handbag feels like you’re carry bricks, it’s time to
clean out your bag and only carry key essential items for everyday use. It is important to note that what one person puts in their
handbag is not the same for the other person, we’re all different so what we
put in our bags will be different too. However, if you have just started carrying a handbag or need
to declutter your handbag, here is a list of key essentials items that should
be in your handbag. -  Cellphone -  Water bottle -  House and car keyes -  Hand cream -  Lip balm -  Small touch up makeup bag -  Sunglasses with a case -  A Pocket mirror -  Tissues -  Purse with your money, debit/credit cards and ID -   Sanitary pads/tampons -   Hair brush -   Medication such as pain killers and headache
tablets
