SMALLER parties are threatening a court action if the Independent Electoral Commission does not budge to their demand of a re run of the elections which they claim were not free and fair. The smaller parties, most of whom are contesting for the first time, called an abrupt press conference at the National Results Centre in Pretoria where they ranted and raved accusing the commission and the media of undermining them. But the main opposition parties the DA and EFF poured cold water on the court action with DA leader Mmusi Maimane telling reporters at the center that the way to go would be to wait for an audit first before making any decisions. Maimane said some of the irregularities that have been raised were concerning. Maimane told reporters: “ I am concerned that some of the citizens were able to vote twice there our call for results audit is a good one.” An EFF party agent said they were confused by the prompt press conference because a meeting was held between IEC and all the parties were these issues were raised and the parties were satisfied with the undertaking of the IEC to probe the matter further. GOOD leader Patricia de Lille echoed this in an interview with the SABC, saying all parties agreed to this.The EFF agent said the party leadership would clarify the party’s position at a later stage. The IEC is still to respond to smaller parties threat.
