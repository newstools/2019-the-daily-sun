BANYANA Banyana star Nothando “Vvo” Vilakazi has gotten off to a flying start for her new European team. The star, who made her debut last week, capped her second appearance for Gintra Universitetas FC in Lithuania with a goal. Vilakazi’s goal came during her side’s 9-0 mauling of Bantra FC in the A Lyga. The Banyana left-back recently joined the Lithuanian side alongside compatriot Jermaine Seoposenwe on a one-year deal. “It was a free kick but this one was different from the others in a way. Usually, when I take a free-kick I think about whether I should pass to the striker or not – but this time around I did not hesitate and shot straight to the goalkeeper, and when I saw it go in I was overjoyed,” Vilakazi told SAFA media. Vilakazi, who had a bout of flu upon her arrival a few weeks ago, has since fully recovered and has settled in well in her new surroundings. She has managed to get some minutes under her belt and is establishing herself as a key player for her new side. “So far it has been an amazing experience, getting to play in every match is every player’s dream because the more you play the better you become as an individual – and you also grow as a team. The good thing also is that we are doing well and that gives us the much-needed boost with every game we approach,” she added.
