The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) in KwaZulu-Natal says it is confident that no protest action will interfere with elections in Durban on Wednesday. "Security wise, we have a detailed plan with police and are fairly confident that we will have a smooth election. We do not see an impact at all from last week's strike," said provincial electoral officer Mawethu Mosery. He was speaking at the Results Centre at the Public Works Offices in Mayville, Durban. Mosery said all venues had been secured by police. "You [the public] will have access to all venues without any issues. We are working closely with SAPS." IEC acting provincial officer Ntombifuthi Masinga meanwhile gave a breakdown of special votes, saying that they were happy with voter turnout over the past two days. Masinga said so far 54 703 special votes were administered out of 102 453. This left the IEC with 47 750 approved special votes to administer on Tuesday. IEC staff locked up in one incident She said there was the locking up of IEC staff in KwaMaphumulo, north of Durban, on Monday but that the matter had been resolved. "The staff were able to leave and materials were delivered. Police intervened and brought the situation under control." Masinga said there was also a shooting in the Weenen area, but that it was not related to elections. "Staff were also caught up in the area, but police had converged and ensured their safety. The shooting was around 18:00 on Monday and was not related to elections. No one was injured." There was just one area, Nkovukeni, where voting would close early, Mosery said. "This will operate shorter than all others because of hippos. Police will assist in the crossing of that river that contains the animals." He said that there were 239 voters in the area with the voting station opening at 09:00 and closing at 14:00. https://www.news24.com/Elections/News/iec-not-expecting-strike-disruptions-in-durban-during-elections-20190507
