BOARD members of the KwaMashu Christian Care Society in KwaMashu, north of Durban, have been left wondering about its future. This is after the matron wrote a letter dissolving the board. They said the move shocked them as it was the matron herself who was supposed to go. “We don’t understand why she dissolved the board. We suspect she did this because we have been questioning a lot of things,” board members said. They said she ill-treated her staff and they were unhappy with the food portions she gave the gogos. “She does not declare donations when she receives them. There is also a building that was erected in 2012 to accommodate 80 more people but it has never been used,” they said. The centre could no longer accept more gogos needing care because the building remained unused. “Those are a few of the things we questioned but never received any report.” They claimed they did not understand why the matron continued working at the centre as her contract had ended. “We are supposed to start interviewing applicants on 13 May, but we don’t know what will happen as the boardroom is locked.” The matron refused to comment and referred questions to centre director Zanele Mabaso. Mabaso refused to comment after Daily Sun sent her a text message asking for details.
