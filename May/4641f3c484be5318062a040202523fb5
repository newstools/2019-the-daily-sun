FOR two months, rubbish has been piling up and residents are angry. Officials from Dihlabeng Municipality in Bethlehem allegedly told people they didn’t have trucks to collect the rubbish. On Monday, residents emptied their bins on the streets and caused a traffic jam. A resident said: “We can’t live like this. Our homes are like a dump. For two months the municipality has been promising to collect rubbish, but nothing has happened. “Now we have thrown rubbish on the streets and blocked the roads. Maybe the municipal officials will listen now.” Another resident said: “The municipality should deliver what they promised. “We need services just like other people.” Municipal spokesman Tshediso Maitse said: “Our rubbish trucks have unexpected breakdowns so we have not been able to stick to the schedule. Our teams are forced to share resources and work longer hours to cover areas that were missed out.” He said claims that rubbish has not been collected for two months were false. Police spokeswoman Constable Puleng Lebakeng said: “Three people aged between 20 and 43 were arrested and charged with public violence.”
