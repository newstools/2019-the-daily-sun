Stop neglecting and ill-treating your domestic worker. Domestic workers are not given the recognition they deserve. They are the most overworked people in the country. Domestic workers are important drivers of the economy, yet they are among the lowest paid workers today. Their fate was sealed during the apartheid era when “kitchen girls” were just servants with no rights. Poor enforcement of regulations and regressive employer attitudes mean domestic workers’ rights are being violated by people who would never accept similar working conditions themselves. Abuses of domestic workers, typically taking place in private homes and hidden from the public eye, have drawn increased attention in recent years. Why is it that they don’t get recognition? Just as their employers go out to make the money, domestic workers help to build the economy. Yet, when it comes to rewarding them, their so called employers give them small change from their fat salaries. They regard them merely as a tax liability or expense, like the petrol they put in their cars. Domestic workers often make extraordinary sacrifices to support their families and yet they are among the most exploited and abused workers in the world. These employers must remember that all workers have rights under the Constitution and our labour regulations. Look after them because they are taking care of your children and your homes.
