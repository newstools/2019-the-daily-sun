A GRADE 12 pupil at Phayikeni High School was allegedly moered by a councillor on Friday. The councillor from one of the municipalites in Alfred Duma apparently beat him after he found a cellphone in his pocket. The pupil’s parent told Daily Sun: “How come the councillor interfered in a pupil’s behaviour to the extent of beating him?” She said the official wasn’t a teacher, which created questions over his authority at the school. “We’re asking why a councillor is doing a principal’s job?” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A case was opened at Besters cop shop.” Principal Sibone Zikalala said: “I wasn’t on the premises, so I don’t know how he got inside.” The councillor’s phone has been on voicemail since Wednesday, and he didn’t respond to messages. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “Trespassing at a school and attacking a pupil is wrong. We’d be disappointed if the councillor did this, because he’s seen as a protector of society.”
