FIRST, she heard a crash against the pavement. And then she felt incredible pain as the car hit her from behind. Thobisile Ngema (21) from Mayville, Durban, said she was on her way to work on Monday morning when a Rescue Care ambulance jumped onto the pavement before hitting her and three other people. She was the only one who survived, walking away with scratches on her legs. “It was going very fast. It hit another car, swung off the road and landed on the pavement where it hit the four of us. Then it landed on a tree,” she said. One of the people died on the scene while the other two died in hospital. “I didn’t know any of them,” she said. Thobisile was treated at King Edward VIII Hospital and later discharged. Rescue Care spokesman Gareth Jamieson said he couldn’t comment as police were investigating. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of culpable homicide was opened at Cato Manor Police Station. She said the ambulance driver lost control of the vehicle.
