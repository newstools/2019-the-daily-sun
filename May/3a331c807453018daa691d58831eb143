Services at the Roodepoort Home Affairs Department have been
suspended until further notice. On Monday, people who wanted to use the department’s services were
confronted by closed doors. The Home Affairs branch in the west of Joburg reportedly experienced
a burglary on Sunday. The department’s spokesman, David Hlabane said computers were
taken during the break-in, but did not disclose how many were stolen. At this stage it is also unclear what impact the service
disruption will have, on people who are already waiting to be issued with
various documents they have applied for. The department said the incident is beyond its control. Hlabane said the matter has been reported to the police for
investigations. He said: “At this stage the department is unable to confirm when
services will resume. However, the department’s intention is to resume service
as soon as possible.” “Customers who require services urgently, should visit any nearest
office for help,” Hlabane said. He said the department is hopeful that citizens will bear with
them for the unavailability of services at this branch. He added that the department will do all in its power to ensure a
speedy resumption of services to minimize the impact and inconvenience caused
to the people who rely on its services.”
