A speeding couple is out on R1 500 bail each after they were nabbed racing in their two cars in Alberton in Ekurhuleni on Wednesday. The couple was driving at an excessive speed on the N12 freeway, clocking 180km/h and 181km/h. They claimed that they were on the way home when they were stopped by Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) officers. A 32-year-old female driver in an Audi A3 registered 181km/h and her 35-year-old male partner clocked 180km/h in a grey VW Scirocco. The duo was driving parallel to each other and alleged that they were both going to the same house when they were apprehended. EMPD spokesperson Kobeli Mokheseng said officers were manning an operation targeting speedsters on the N12 freeway direction east by R59 bridge in Alberton. "The operation was conducted by the EMPD high speed unit on Wednesday, May 1, [and] yielded seven arrests between 10:00 and 16:00. The halted seven people included a pair whom we believe...were racing at the time of their arrest. "On this 120km/h zone stretch of the N12 freeway, the arrestees were six males and one female person with ages ranging from 32 to 54. They clocked excessive speeds of between 162km/h and 182km/h and were all in sedans except for one who was [on] a motorcycle. All the arrested speedsters were charged at Alberton police station for reckless and negligent driving but later released after they each paid a R1 500 bail,"  he said. The suspects are expected to appear in the Palmridge Magistrate's Court soon on charges of reckless and negligent driving. SOURCE:NEWS24
