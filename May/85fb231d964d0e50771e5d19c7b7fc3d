IT IS payback time for Nealon Redhouse, whose evil deeds have earned him hefty jail sentences. Redhouse (21) was sentenced to eight years in jail on Monday for illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said Redhouse was sentenced to an effective 18 years by the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court last year for two murders and gang-related charges committed in November 2015. In July Redhouse and his co-accused Deon Harmse (24) were sentenced for: “A total 89 years’ imprisonment was imposed on them, of which 30 years will effectively be served,” said Naidu. “Redhouse will start serving his 30-year sentence after he completes serving his 18-year sentence for the 2015 murders.” She said he was convicted on Monday for illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition when he was arrested in July 2016 in Bethelsdorp. “A 9mm pistol, bulletproof vest and two cellphones were recovered. The firearm was linked to several cases. “Redhouse was sentenced to eight years, four years of which will run concurrently with the other sentences.” He’ll be in prison for 52 years!
