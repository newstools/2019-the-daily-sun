A FEW months after invading a piece of land, backyarders were removed. Since then they have been living in the Luyolo Community Centre in Gugulethu, Cape Town. The backyarders, who call themselves the Gugulethu Seven after the freedom fighters killed by the cops in 1986, told Daily Sun they had been waiting for a year to be moved. Nomaphelo Qonda said: “We have received promising news from human settlements about a piece of land they found for us. It’s not nice living here because people get sick. There are about 100 of us here and there are children. We have beds and fridges, which we share.” Babalwa April (27) said their situation was not being treated as an emergency. Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela recently announced that 9 000 units would be built for backyarders in Gugulethu. However, his spokesman Nathan Adriaanse couldn’t say whether the Gugulethu Seven would benefit. “They have not been screened and we cannot confirm the exact number of people who will benefit from this project.”
