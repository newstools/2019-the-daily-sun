THEY thought they finally had a place to call home, but the city had other plans. Yesterday residents of Lenasia, Joburg watched helplessly as their homes were demolished. Philisiwe Sithole (40) told Daily Sun her house was not demolished but felt for those whose houses were flattened. “We came to stay here because government said if we find land we can occupy it, as long as we don’t erect shacks but build houses. Today I’m surprised to hear that I’m not supposed to be here,” she said. Phindile Thwala (35) told the SunTeam she was confused and frustrated. “My daughters will come back from school to find that they no longer have a home. How will I explain this to them?” she said. She said she’s also been living in the area for two years and was still paying a loan she took to build her house. Cops spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said people whose houses were demolished didn’t follow procedure when they occupied the land. “People freely occupy or buy stands from someone who wrongly claims to own the land. That’s why an eviction order was issued,” he said. City of Joburg spokesman Nthatise Modingoane said: “The city can confirm that it did obtain a court order to demolish structures in Lenasia South. Most of the structures demolished were half built and unoccupied. “A notice was placed in the area in accordance with the PIE Act. Where there was full occupation on arrival, a structure was left intact and the city will be going to court for an eviction order. “The city refutes claims that it gave anyone the go-ahead to build in the area and confirms that the land was illegally invaded, hence the court order was obtained.” PIE stands for Prevention of Illegal Eviction.
