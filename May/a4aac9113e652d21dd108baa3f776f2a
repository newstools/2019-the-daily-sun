A motorist
intends pleading not guilty to attempted murder in connection with allegations
that he drove over a security guard in a parking area, the Stellenbosch
Magistrate's Court heard on Friday. Johan
Steyn, 38, from Kraaifontein, made his first appearance in court. His beard
appeared a few days old and he was wearing a grey jacket and jeans. Magistrate
Alaric Amos granted him R2 000 bail after defence lawyer Bruce Hendricks argued
that he was not a flight risk and would abide by all bail conditions. Steyn, who
owns a general building repairs and maintenance business, said in an affidavit
that he should be released from custody because he had to look after his wife
and their one-year-old son.  SOURCE:
