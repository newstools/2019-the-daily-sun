ALTHOUGH there have been two weeks of good rain in the Eastern Cape, the province is not safe yet. Dam levels in the Gamtoos Valley region and Makhanda have continued to decline. Water department spokesman Sputnik Ratau said the two regions remain a source of concern as there is almost no drinkable water available. “In Makhanda, residents rely on tank water for basic use as the local river is at its lowest level. The average levels in the province dropped to 62,4% this week. “Nqweba Dam, which is supplied by the Sundays River in Nelson Mandela Bay, is virtually empty at 1,5%,” said Ratau. He said although the country had enough water to get through the dry winter, it must be used sparingly. “For the past two weeks, the country has maintained stable dam levels at 73,7%, a 6,2% drop compared to the same period last year. At 96,8%, Gauteng has the highest dam levels in the country.”
