Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham were saluted on Thursday after producing the second English Champions League "miracle" within 24 hours to set up a final against Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool. Lucas Moura's last-gasp strike took Spurs to the European showpiece for the first time in their history as he completed his hat-trick and sealed an incredible 3-2 win over Ajax to leave the young Dutch side heartbroken. Ajax, leading 1-0 after the first leg in London, scored twice in the first half in Amsterdam on Wednesday through Matthijs de Ligt and Hakim Ziyech, leaving the visitors with the improbable task of needing to score three goals without reply. But Moura struck twice within four minutes in the second half and steered a low shot beyond the despairing dive of Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana in the 96th minute as Spurs progressed to next month's final in Madrid on away goals. It matched the drama of the previous night at Anfield, where Liverpool beat Barcelona 4-0 to overturn a 3-0 first-leg deficit."Really, this was too much. This was a gin-addled north London fantasy," wrote Barney Ronay in the Guardian. "At half-time in Amsterdam Spurs were 3-0 down to Ajax and drifting into the realm of last things and end times, trying, at best, to lose well."Six minutes into stoppage time at the end they were in some other place entirely, propelled to a first Champions League final by that impossible hat-trick goal from Lucas Moura, who was irresistible all night, a cartoon of scurrying craft and malevolent energy."The Times hailed Spurs' never-say-die attitude."What happened was that Pochettino's players, inspired by their coach's half-time exhortations and a key substitution, reacted fully in keeping with the club's traditions of boldness, daring and belief," wrote chief football correspondent Henry Winter.
