 PUBLIC PROTECTOR Busisiwe Mkhwebane could appeal against the North Gauteng High Court ruling on her investigation into the Estina Dairy Farm project. Mkhwebane said she disagreed with the ruling. On Monday Judge Ronel Tolmay ruled that Mkhwebaneâ€™s report was unconstitutional and invalid and set it aside. She also said the public protector acted irrationally by neglecting a complaint laid in May 2016 regarding the project. Mkhwebane said rather than arguing the merits of her case in the media, she would express herself in court if direct access was granted. However, she was astonished at the ruling, given that, during arguments last October, her counsel went to great lengths to make it clear to the high court that she could not investigate the allegations contained in the third complaint received in May 2016. According to her, this was because the investigation had been virtually wrapped up.
