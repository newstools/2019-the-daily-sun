After missing out on automatic promotion Royal Eagles got their Premier Soccer League promotional play-off campaign off to a positive start overcoming Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila on Wednesday afternoon. The two sides were meeting for the third time this season having mat twice in the first round and second round of National First Division (NFD) campaign. Eagles continued with their dominance over Tshakhuma when they defeated them 1-0 thanks to Strydom Mwambi solitary strike in the first half of the encounter which was played at Chartsworth Stadium. Eagles finished second in the National First Division on 53 points, three behind champions Stellenbosch FC, while Tshakhuma were third on 51 points.Eagles dominated the opening stages of the match in an effort to establish an early foothold, but the visitors were making it difficult for them to find the back of the net.They did, however, find a chink in the opposition armour in the 22nd minute, as Wambi got his head onto a corner kick. In their two league meetings in the league, Eagles defeated Tshakhuma 3-2 in Limpopo and played a draw in the second round. The result now has given Eagles an edge, and it will be a huge moral boost going to second match on Sunday where they will face Maritzburg United, who finished in the Absa Premiership season in 15th place, at Harry Gwala Stadium (3pm).
