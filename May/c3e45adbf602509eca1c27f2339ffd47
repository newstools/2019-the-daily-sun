SPEAKING at the Nedbank Finance Football Forum symposium in Durban ahead of Saturday's much anticipated Nedbank Cup final at Moses Mabhida Stadium, SA soccer legend Jerry Sikhosana is praying that Kaizer Chiefs will beat TS Galaxy. Galaxy, the new kids on the block surprised all and sundry by reaching the last stage of the tournament, along the way dumping out much fancied Golden Arrows in the semi-finals. Sikhosana, an Orlando Pirates stalwart and a feared goal poacher in his youth - and also a Ke Yona Team Search coach, says he wants his Ke Yona Team players to face mighty Amakhosi after the final. The chosen Ke Yona Team players will face winners of the Nedbank Cup and Sikhosana believes that will be excellent for the youngsters. “Imagine those kids playing against Chiefs at a full stadium. That would be a fantastic opportunity for them. Plus I’m a Chiefs fan and it would be nice to play against them,” said Sikhosana.
