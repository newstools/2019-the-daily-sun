YOUR driver’s licence needs to be renewed four weeks before its expiry date. If you renew it after the expiry date, you’ll have to apply for a temporary licence at an additional cost. You will undergo an eye test and your fingerprints will be taken. If your sight has worsened from the date on which your licence was issued, new conditions will be attached to your licence.
