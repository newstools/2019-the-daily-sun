MANY women want to be mums and hold their newborns after giving birth. But for Constable Jane Ntuli, who was attached to the Delmas Police Station in Mpumalanga, it was not to be. The 36-year-old policewoman, who was eight months pregnant, was driving home on the R42 Bronkhorstspruit road from work on Saturday night when a car hit hers from behind. This was after the driver of the other car apparently skipped a stop sign. Police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said Ntuli, who was pregnant, was airlifted to hospital with what seemed like life-threatening injuries immediately after the crash. “Doctors managed to deliver the baby the same night but sadly Ntuli succumbed to her injuries the next morning.” Bhembe said the matter was being investigated. A case of culpable homicide has been opened. Major-General Frans Mashika, acting Mpumalanga provincial police commissioner, extended his heartfelt condolences to her family. Mashika said Ntuli’s death had left a void in the hearts of her family, the police, and the local community, which she had served with dedication for many years. He urged motorists to follow the rules of the road to prevent unnecessary loss of life.
