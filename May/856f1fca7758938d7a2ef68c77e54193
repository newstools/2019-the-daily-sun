PHUZEKHEMISI arrived in court surrounded by a group of madalas. The case seems to be taking its toll on the maskandi artist, who appeared nervous and stressed before taking the stand in the Durban Court in KZN yesterday. The artist whose real name is Zibokwakhe Mnyandu, is charged with the murder of band member Selby Shezi, who died in hospital in December. The case took less than five minutes and was postponed to the 26 June for further investigation. When Phuzekhemisi arrived, he sat on the benches outside the courtroom. Later he went in and sat behind Shezi’s family. After the postponement he looked more relaxed. Phuzekhemisi’s younger brother, Lethukuthula Mnyandu, said: “It’s the first time he’s found himself in this situation. “We want to help him but we don’t know what else we can do, except come to court to support him.” Phuzekhemisi is currently out on R3 000 bail.
