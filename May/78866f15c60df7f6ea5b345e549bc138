A FAMILY of three narrowly escaped death after a bakkie landed on their shack on Saturday night. Nhlanhla Mnganga (42), his girlfriend Thembisile Buthelezi (42) and their child Sibongile Buthelezi (4) made it out with minor injuries but the driver wasn’t so lucky. Busisiwe Buthelezi (44), a relative of the victims from Z Section in Umlazi, south of Durban, said they were recovering at home. “After watching the game between Kaizer Chiefs and TS Galaxy FC, the three went to sleep in an outside shack. “Shortly afterwards we heard a loud bang. “When we rushed outside we found their shack had been demolished by a van which had landed on it,” said Busisiwe. She said the driver and her relatives were rushed to Prince Mshiyeni Hospital. “After my family members were discharged from hospital on Sunday, the family of the driver told us he had died from his injuries in hospital.” Busisiwe said they still wanted their shack fixed even though the driver was dead. “My three family members don’t have a proper place to sleep anymore,” said Busisiwe. She said the driver’s family had come to inspect the damage to their property and to check on her family member. A relative of the driver said: “Allow me to not comment,” before hanging up. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said on Saturday at about 10.10m, a 36-year-old man was driving on Sgananda Avenue when he allegedly lost control of his vehicle and landed on top of a shack in Z section. “He was seriously injured and taken to hospital for medical attention. “The three occupants of the house sustained minor injuries and were treated and discharged. “Bhekithemba police are investigating a case of culpable homicide s well as all the circumstances around the incident,” said Zwane.
