A MAN who is believed to be a lawyer and 11 accomplices were arrested for possession of stolen cattle on Tuesday. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi of the Mpumalanga police said the 32-year-old man was arrested after police received information about the theft. “Members of the stock theft unit in Middelburg, with the help of other units and a private security firm, found two trucks loaded with cattle, while a third was being loaded,” said Hlathi. “The other suspects fled, leaving the lawyer and his father. “This is not the first time the community has suffered stock losses.” Hlathi said it was reported that during the theft the two men and a woman who were looking after the cattle were attacked and their hands and feet bound. Three trucks, a bakkie and R95 000 were seized by police. “After the arrest, the other 10 men, believed to be the suppliers, were caught.” The suspects, aged between 34 and 53, will appear in court soon to face charges of theft of livestock and possession of stolen property.
