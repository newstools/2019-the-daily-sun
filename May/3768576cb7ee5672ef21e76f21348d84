PUPILS and teachers from Mariannridge Secondary School outside Durban couldn’t enter the grounds after parents locked the gates. The parents first locked the gates on Monday, disrupting exams. Two parents standing outside the gate told pupils they should write their exams at a nearby school. “The school has been dysfunctional for two years,” said one of the parents. “Pupils are not being taught as some teachers refuse to teach.” He claimed pupils smoked and even had sex at the school. “The toilets are dirty and unusable. We called a meeting on Friday to find out why teachers are not teaching but they didn’t give us explanations,” he said. He said they will keep the gates locked until they got answers. Another parent said they were disappointed at how the school was being neglected. “The majority of the teachers are causing chaos and refusing to work,” said the parent. Department of education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: “These parents are depriving pupils of their right to education. The principal should stabilise the situation even if it means calling the police.” South African Democratic Teachers Union secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said she contacted their members and discovered that there are disputes among union members and teachers at the school. “Yesterday afternoon there was a meeting which was attended by two of our members. “I believe they will find out what caused the disputes. We will deal with it because we can’t have pupils not being taught,” she said.
