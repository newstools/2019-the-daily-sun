MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says they are searching for a striker that will help them win the Caf Champions League again. His charges were booted in the semi-final stage of the competition following a 2-1 aggregate defeat to Morocco side Wydad Casablanca after they won the trophy in 2016. The outspoken mentor will also release some players to pave the way for new recruits. He made this statement in Durban yesterday after being crowned the Absa Premiership Coach of the Year for the second successive season. Said Mosimane: “We need a very good striker. I have been playing Thapelo Morena as a striker, a winger as right-back. We have given Lebohang Maboe a hard time to play as a striker, he is a midfielder. We have even played Tebogo Langerman as a striker, so we need one more up front. We need to have a player who will take us to the final and help us win the Champions League.” Mosimane said he is humbled by winning the Coach of the Season award again after he guided Sundowns to defend the league title. He added: “You get humbled, you appreciate, it makes you work harder, you catch the bug of winning and want to do it all the time. It’s a big one and I still have my own emotions on this one because of the way it went. It could have been smoother like all other years, but again a team in construction managed to lift the trophy again, so it was beautiful at the end.”
