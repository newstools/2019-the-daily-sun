IN JUST 10 years, this 53-year-old lost two marriages. The man from Falcon Ridge in Vereeniging, in the Vaal told Daily Sun his problems were caused by his 4-5.He said he was happily married with three kids until 2009. “Things started to spiral out of control that year.” He said he confronted his wife, who told him he didn’t satisfy her between the sheets. “She told me my thing was too small and she couldn’t continue lying to me or herself about it.” He said he later married again but his 4-5 kept shrinking. “My second wife made it clear I wasn’t doing it for her.” The man said he was afraid to get into any more relationships. “The pills the doctors give me don’t help and traditional healers just take my money.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said Sam was a victim of a type of muthi called iMfinyezi. “It causes the 4-5 to shrink. It is a complex condition that requires specialist inyangas. No medical doctor can help.”
