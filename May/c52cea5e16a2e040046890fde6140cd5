Fifa have abandoned their plan to expand the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to 48 teams. Fifa president Gianni Infantino had hoped to bring the expansion, which was initially planned for 2026, forward to 2022. However, those plans have been put on ice for the time being with the governing body saying the change could not be made now. “Following a thorough and comprehensive consultation process with the involvement of all the relevant stakeholders, it was concluded that under the current circumstances such a proposal could not be made now,” read a statement from the world football football governing body. “Additionally, FIFA and Qatar have once again explored the feasibility of Qatar hosting a 48-team tournament by in particular lowering certain key FIFA requirements. “A joint analysis, in this respect, concluded that due to the advanced stage of preparations and the need for a detailed assessment of the potential logistical impact on the host country, more time would be required and a decision could not be taken before the deadline of June. It was therefore decided not to further pursue this option. “The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 will therefore remain as originally planned with 32 teams and no proposal will be submitted at the next FIFA Congress on 5 June.”
