Bafana Bafana midfielder Keagan Dolly is eager to prove his fitness to coach Stuart Baxter ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) set to be staged in Egypt in June. The Montpellier star was named in David Notoane’s COSAFA Cup squad as well as Baxter’s 30 man provisional squad for the Afcon. The 26-year-old, who will be playing in his first ever COSAFA Cup, is hoping to use the tournament to get some much needed game time following an injury ravaged season in the French League 1. Speaking to the media from Bafana’s camp in Durban, Dolly revealed the reasons behind his request to feature in the COSAFA Cup. “My family and I decided that it was important for me to be part of this team because it's a good way to show the coaches my level of fitness,” said the former Mamelodi Sundowns star." So, that was the main reason and then, of course, I also need the game-time, especially because of the season I had, it was a bit difficult with injuries and not playing as much as I wanted to. "But I am excited to be part of this exciting team and just getting back to my normal self. AFCON will also depend on how I do here, but I just want to get my confidence back and I'll give my all to help the COSAFA team. "Hopefully then when I do join the AFCON squad, I can be at my best again and just make the final squad to go and represent the country well in Egypt."
