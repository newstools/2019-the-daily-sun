EFF leader Julius Malema says he declined a cabinet job offered to him by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Malema revealed the details of a meeting he had with President Cyril Ramaphosa during an interview on Power FM on Friday. He said him and his deputy, Floyd Shavambu, met Ramaphosa who offered them a ministerial and deputy minister positions. “There was an offer, when President Ramaphosa came in, that we can serve in his cabinet and we said we are not available to serve under the ANC cabinet. “We were in the meeting, the three of us: me, him and Floyd [Shivambu]. There was no specific department but the ministry was offered, the deputy ministry was offered,” said Malema. Speaking on POWER Talk, Malema explained why he turned Ramaphosa’s offer down. “I know Cyril for what he is. He is a negotiator so he was trying to take chances for the sake of peace, perhaps, in parliament but also for the liquidation of the EFF because I’ve seen how they liquidated Azapo. L Look at what happened to AZAPO, they liquidated it by giving the MP’s ministerial positions and they could not criticise the ANC. So, I don’t want that to happen to the EFF.
