HE was not at home when three men came looking for him on Sunday. As a result, they sprayed his family with a volley of bullets, killing his sister and her two-year-old baby, and injuring his father, fiance and his other sister. Now, Themba Maphumulo (35), of Maqongqo, outside Pietermaritzburg, is living in fear. The distraught man said he believes the bullets were meant for him. Themba said his sister, Kwenzi (29) and her child, Melokuhle, died instantly. His fiance, Nomfundo Goge (33), pregnant sister Velile (19) and father Alfred (71) were critically injured. Themba claimed the men probably wanted to kill him because he had had an argument with them earlier that day. He said he had taken a neighbour to hospital when he received a call from one of his sisters telling him there were suspicious people outside the house. “I rushed home, only to find five of my family members had been shot. My mother survived because she wasn’t in the house at the time.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said two cases of murder and three of attempted murder were being investigated.
