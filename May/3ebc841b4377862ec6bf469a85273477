RESIDENTS of Bluegum View are gatvol of children going missing. On Friday, Ntokozo Ginya (9) became the latest victim when he was bundled into a white VW Golf by four unknown men. He was on his way home from a spaza shop. Sergeant Harry Manaka from Duduza Police Station, Ekurhuleni, said the boy was with two friends when the car stopped. “His friends told us the men flashed money to get them to go close to the car. They refused and one of the men opened the door to grab Ntokozo,” he said. “They said Ntokozo screamed for help and they ran home to inform the adults. Residents searched for the car but it was nowhere to be found.” Ntokozo’s madala, Michael Ginya, said there was no sign of him. “He’s a quiet and respectful boy. He was raised not to talk to strangers. I started looking after him when his mum died when he was four,” he said. “I’m appealing to whoever took my grandson to release him.” Residents said they were starting to get worried as it seemed children in parts of Ekurhuleni were being targeted. Kidnapping and missing person’s cases were opened and cops asked anyone with information to contact Captain Bongani Lukhule on 082 822 7761, or the Duduza police on 011 730 4723.
