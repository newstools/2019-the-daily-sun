POLICE are investigating a case of malicious damage to property after a shop owned by foreigners was destroyed by a fire. The incident happened at Nati Cash & Carry supermarket in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, yesterday. A worker said they were waiting to report for duty when they noticed smoke coming out of the building, followed by an explosion. “We screamed for help as we watched the blaze while waiting for the fire vehicle to arrive,” said the worker. “Now we’re unemployed. We depended on this job to support our families, and the worst part is that the shop owner died a few days before this incident happened.” Municipal fire and rescue chief Rexon Silinda said the fire started at about 5am. “We managed to control the fire but everything inside was destroyed. No injuries were reported,” said Silinda. Police spokeswoman Constable Merilyne Mmonuua confirmed a case of malicious damage to property was opened. She said investigations were under way to determine the cause of the fire.
