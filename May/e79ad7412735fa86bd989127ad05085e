NO one is indispensable… so goes the popular saying. But in the case of special players such as Percy Tau and Khama Billiat, the old maxim doesn’t quite hold true.If in doubt, ask Pitso Mosimane and the Mamelodi Sundowns coach will gladly tell you. As Tau scored the winner for Saint Gilloise in their 3-2 Jupiter Pro League playoff victory against Cercle Bregge in Belgium at the weekend, the Brazilians exited the Caf Champions League following their 2-1 semifinals aggregate loss to Wydad Casablanca. “We tried to reinforce after we lost Khama and Percy, our top strikers. We signed Ali Meza, Toni Silva, Jeremy Brockie, Aubrey Ngoma … but the reality is that the gap was not closed. That is the truth,” said Mosimane. “When you lose those two (Billiat and Tau) the team is a bit difficult to maintain, so I am happy with the team coming in the top four (Champions League). When you go out in the semifinals, with a 2-1 aggregate scoreline, you have to face the reality and accept it.” The two were instrumental to Sundowns’ success in the premier continental competition, before the both left the Pretoria giants in the off-season. While Billiat has generally struggled to inspire Kaizer Chiefs to victories in big matches, Tau has enhanced his growing reputation in Europe with ever-improving performances. The 24-year-old midfielder has been in sizzling form for Belgian side, netting 11 goals in 34 matches in all competition for Belgian side Saint Gilloise, and has been nominated for the Player of the Year award in Belgium’s second division.
