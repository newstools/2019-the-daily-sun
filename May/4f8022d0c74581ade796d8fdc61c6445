Angola has withdrawn from the 2019 COSAFA Cup, just days before the tournament gets underway. TheÂ Palancas Negras, as Angoila are affectionately known, have cited the need to complete their league season and preparations for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) as the reasons. The tournament, which runs May 25 until 5 June, will have one less team as a replacement for Angola could not be found. "The short notice has placed COSAFA Cup organisers in a tight spot and despite canvasing far and wide across the continent for a replacement, the time-frame simply did not allow for a new participant with the tournament to get under way in Durban this weekend," read a statement.
