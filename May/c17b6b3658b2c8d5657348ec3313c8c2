COPS have launched a manhunt for four suspected hijackers who fired shots at the police on Monday. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said Ntuzuma police were patrolling in the Richmond Farm area when they saw a suspicious looking car. They tried to stop it but the suspects drove off and the police gave chase. The suspects stopped in J Section of KwaMashu, north of Durban. Gwala said they abandoned the car and escaped on foot. She said the suspects fired shots at the police and an attempted murder case was being investigated by the KwaMashu police. Gwala said no injuries were sustained by any cops. “A preliminary investigation at the scene revealed that the vehicle was highjacked on 2 March in Morningside. “Police are still searching for the suspects, who fled the scene,” said Gwala. Residents told Daily Sun everything happened very fast but they were glad none of them was injured during the shooting.
