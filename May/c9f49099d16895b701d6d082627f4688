HER fans were getting touchy, but she was definitely not stripped! Zodwa Wabantu told Daily Sun after the button on her outfit popped, some men tried to touch her, but no one did anything that scared her. “You know I’m a people’s person and not a celebrity,” she told the People’s Paper about the incident at Oom Cola in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, over the weekend. “As I went to dance my button fell off. The fans were being touchy, so I was taken off the stage.” Zodwa said she’d have disciplined the men, had they stripped her. “The most that could ever happen is letting my fans touch me, not undress me. “You saw on the video that I was laughing. Let me set the record straight – it was just a button which came off.” Following the short video of the incident making rounds on social media, many male fans wished they were there when it happened. Zodwa told social media fans to catch her show, Zodwa Wabantu Uncensored, on Moja Love (DStv channel 157) on 25 May.
