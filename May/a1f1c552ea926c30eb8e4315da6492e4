Two voting stations in Zoeknog outside Arcornhoek were unable
to open  for special votes on Monday and Tuesday, after residents prevented IEC
officials from entering the area. Residents were protesting for services such as water and
proper roads from the government. IEC municipal electoral officer in Bushbuckridge, Henry
Mhlaba, said they were concerned that operations from these two voting stations
have been halted making it difficult for voters to cast their votes. He said a meeting will be held to find a solution to have
the stations opened for Wednesday. Meanwhile fuming residents of Rolle Trust outside
Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga are threatening to barricade
roads and boycott the general elections on Wednesday. They said not having access to clean water is the reason
they will not vote. On Tuesday they blocked the roads around the village
demanding water from Bushbuckridge Local Municipality saying they were tired of
fetching water from the river and drinking water with animals. Police had to use robber bullets to disperse the
residents after they refused to be addressed by municipality’s chief whip
Million Makaringe. Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said the problem is
being addressed as contractors are still busy with installation of water to
households.
