THEY may not be as revered as known European giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, but Sevilla FC are giants in their own right with a rapidly growing popularity across the globe. As many as 35 000 Tanzanians football enthusiasts turned out to see the five-time UEFA Europa League winners tackle Tanzania’s 20- time champions Simba SC in a LaLiga World Challenge clash at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam recently. The likes of Ever Banega, Nolito, Quincy Promes and Jesus Navas were part of history-making trip as Sevilla became the first Spanish club and the second European club after Everton to play a match in the East African country. The Seville team travelled as part of the LaLiga World project and spent enough time to take part in a number of activities during their three-day stay, including a football clinic with youth players from local side Bom Bom, a management seminar with local clubs and institutions and a cultural visit to the National Museum of Tanzania. “We knew it would be a tough game given that Simba SC are national champions and they gave us a great game. It’s been a great experience for the fans because it’s always a spectacle when there are so many goals, For sure, we will be good ambassadors of Tanzania in Spain,” said Promes, scorer in the 5-4 win. Tanzania Sports minister Harrison Mwakwembe remarked: “We are thrilled by Sevilla tour and this will simplify the landing of other big clubs in the country.“ Tanzania has reached around the globe for the few days they stayed. They did not come to play football only but also to look at numerous attractions that we have.”
