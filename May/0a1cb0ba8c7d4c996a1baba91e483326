THE shooting of a taxi driver on Sunday morning caused a riot in his village. Oscar Mkhabela (23) was shot dead in Makosha Village, near Thohoyandou in Limpopo. He was allegedly shot by a tavern owner who is a former cop from Modjadjiskloof Police Station. Oscar’s brother Kolani (26) was wounded and is fighting for his life in Mankweng Hospital. He was shot in the stomach, allegedly by the 55-year-old tavern owner, when he asked why Oscar had been killed. Oscar apparently went to the tavern owner to ask him to intervene after a fight broke out. However, he was reportedly told to get out and sprayed in the face with pepper spray before being shot in the chest. It killed him instantly. After the incident, furious villagers torched four cars and the tavern. Another retired cop at the scene was moered after trying to scare the crowd by shooting his private firearm. He was admitted to hospital. The tavern owner made a brief appearance in the Giyani Magistrates Court on Monday and will appear again next week for a formal bail application. Oscar’s uncle Khazamola (69) said the family was in a state of shock. “How can someone just kill people for telling him there’s a fight and that he should intervene?” he asked. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the victim was shot with a gun belonging to the suspect’s wife. “An angry crowd stormed the tavern and looted alcohol before setting the building and four cars alight.” He said two cop cars were also damaged when police tried to calm the situation. “Eight suspects aged between 22 and 33 were arrested for public violence.”
