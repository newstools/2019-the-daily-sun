AN ACCUSED in the murder of Matwetwe actor Sibusiso Khwinana’s case has been denied bail. The 35-year-old accused made his second appearance in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Friday and it was decided that he should remain in custody. Members of the public gathered outside the court to support the Khwinana family. They pleaded with the magistrate not to grant the accused bail. Magistrate Mali Mokoena postponed the case to 11 June and said it would be moved to the North Gauteng High Court. The accused, whose first language is Swahili, was charged with murder and robbery and in terms of the Immigration Act. He was one of three suspects. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said Khwinana and his friend were on the street of Tshwane when the suspects demanded his cellphone. “As they were wrestling for the cellphone, the victim was allegedly stabbed with a sharp object in the upper body. “He was certified dead on the scene.” After the murder in March, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela called for the suspects to be speedily arrested. One of the people picketing outside court, Ofentse Morudi, said he hoped harsh sentences would be given to those responsible for the murder.
