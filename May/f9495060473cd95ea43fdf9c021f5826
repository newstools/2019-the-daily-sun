SECURITY guards from eight Eskom substations in Rustenburg, North West are on strike. They are demanding to be paid by the security company which employed them. The guards from Top Ten Security Services claim they have not been paid for two months. One of the guards, Natesh Shai (30), said: “Management promised to pay on certain dates but when those days come it’s a different story again. “At this point no one is allowed to enter the station. We will close this operation until we get paid. We have tried to negotiate with them peacefully but it seems as if they are not taking us seriously.” Natesh said they want their money and will not allow any new security company to be employed until they are paid. “They are used to taking disadvantaged people for granted by not paying them. “Then they hire new people so they can also do the same to them,” she said. Another worker, Kelebogile Kgampe, said it was painful to work without getting paid. “We have families and children to send to school. I am in debt because I had to borrow money. Now I can’t pay it back because I haven’t been paid myself.” Kelebogile claimed they had tried to ask for their money peacefully but it didn’t work. Operations manager Silverstar Masinang claimed the staff hadn’t been paid for a month. “We have tried to engage with the guards but it’s difficult trying to make angry workers understand. “We fear for our lives. We understand their grievances and apologise for the inconvenience.” He promised the striking guards that he would meet the finance department to make sure they were paid urgently.
