AKA has confirmed what everyone has been suspecting for a while. The rapper took to Twitter on Monday where he posted pictures from his #HigherThanLux event, which took place at Summo Night Club on Friday. The event was to launch the #HigherThanLux tour which celebrated AKA’s album Touch My Blood going double platinum. But one picture from the event put him and his baby mama DJ Zinhle on top of the Twitter trend list. The picture shows Zinhle and AKA locking lips, and AKA captioned it: “Thank you for coming out this past weekend.” They duo has been posting pictures together on social media for a while now. But none with them kissing. Confirmation that they’d rekindled their love sparked some online debate. Many were happy for the couple. But there were some haters too.
