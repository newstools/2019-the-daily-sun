TRANSPORT Minister Blade Nzimande yesterday announced that the number of deaths on the roads during the Easter holiday period decreased by 48%, from 309 in 2018 to 162 this year. He said, however, government was still concerned about the loss of life on the roads. “All provinces recorded decreases in the number of fatalities. “The highest decrease in absolute figures was recorded by Limpopo with 41 fatalities, followed by KZN with 33 fatalities,” he said. The incidents were recorded between 18 and 22 April. Nzimande said there were 128 crashes this year, a 46% decrease compared with the 238 crashes recorded in 2018. “I am also pleased to report that all provinces recorded decreases in the number of crashes,” the minister said. He said the province that recorded the highest decrease in absolute figures was Limpopo with 27 crashes, followed by KZN with 21. “Three major crashes contributed to 23 fatalities and eight serious injuries. “Ten of these crashes took place in Limpopo, five in KZN, and eight in the Western Cape,” he said. He said the report showed that the main contributing factor to road crashes was human behaviour. “We are encouraged by the behaviour of the majority of motorists and all road users who showed the willingness to obey the rules of the road,” he said.
