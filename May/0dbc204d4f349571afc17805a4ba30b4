A COP is expected to appear in court today in connection with the alleged murder of another policeman. It is allegedly that the suspect, a 30-year-old police constable, shot and killed a colleague, Sergeant Malusi Sibisi (47), during an argument. The two cops were stationed at Ekombe Police Station in Nkandla, northern KwaZulu Natal, when the incident took place. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said it was not clear what triggered the argument. The suspect was off duty, while the dead man was on duty at the time. “The cop who was on duty allegedly got into an argument with the off-duty cop. The latter allegedly shot and killed his colleague,” said Zwane. The suspect was arrested soon after the incident. “A firearm suspected of use in the commission of the crime was seized and will be sent for ballistic tests,” he said. This came as the province was still reeling from the news of the murder of two Durban cops who were shot dead while guarding a councillor’s house in Inanda last week. People on social media voiced their concern about the ongoing bloodshed. Thabo Matsoso said: “KZN must be named killing zone. Shame, people die like flies.” Kryzee Sebiloane said: “I don’t think police work as a team, especially at road blocks. One opens a bribery station over there and another opens another one in the same road block.” Vuyiswa Ndzakana said: “What’s wrong, KZN?”
