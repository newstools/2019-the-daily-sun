GOGO Miriam Makgoro (79) and her grandchildren have nowhere to go. This is after their house was burnt to ash on Friday. Miriam, from Senotlelo, near Siyabuswa, said everyone was fast asleep when she was woken by thick smoke and fire. “I had to scream to wake up the children. I suspect someone did this evil thing.” Her granddaughter Dimakatso Makgoro said the kids’ school books and uniforms, ID documents and birth certificates were burnt. Councillor Johannes Matji said the Dr JS Moroka Municipality promised the family a shack. Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said a case of arson had been opened. She said anyone with information should call Colonel Dickson Matlou at 082 303 9919.
