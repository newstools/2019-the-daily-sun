GENERATIONS: The Legacy has an interesting storyline based on a virus called vutha. It’s all just for TV, but fans seem to have taken the virus to social media. Fans have now resorted to wearing protective clothing when watching the show. This is because according to the show, the vutha virus is highly contagious. On the show, one person has died and four people are critical. And there hasn’t been a cure or any treatment so far. “Mzansi will surprise you. We escaped the polony virus, now this. I’m not about to gamble with my life and watch it without any protection,” said Menzi. “We won’t allow this vutha demon to stop us from watching our favourite soapie. We shall wear plastic until there is a cure.” “When he is bored and decides to watch Generations, I hope one of those sick people transfers this deadly virus to him. He doesn’t deserve to breathe,” said Minenhle.
