TWO police officers have been bust and charged with corruption and defeating the ends of justice. The warrant officer and a sergeant allegedly demanded R2 500 from a housebreaking suspect to avoid jail time. They were arrested on Wednesday at Letlhabile in the North West. “The two police arrested a suspect for housebreaking and theft. The suspect was held at the Letlhabile Police Station in order to be brought to Brits for his court appearance on Wednesday. “The two men approached the suspect and offered to help him get released on bail. They demanded R2 500, stating that the R500 would be for bail and the R2 000 to cover their efforts to organise the bail process,” said the police. “The anti-corruption unit was tipped off and a team was sent to the Brits Magistrates Court, where they were both arrested,” said the police. The police in the area said they were worried about the increasing number of delivery vehicles being hijacked.
