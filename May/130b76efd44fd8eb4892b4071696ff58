PAC president Mzwanele Nyhontso said on Sunday the party did not trust the IEC and would watch voting stations like hawks. Nyhontso was addressing hundreds of party supporters at Centane Town Hall, Eastern Cape, at the party’s last rally before the election. He said the party had campaigned under difficult conditions. “We’ve tried to take the message of the PAC to the people. It’s time to vote for the return of the land and for dignity, or to vote for thieves. “We fought for land. The struggle is still relevant.” He urged South Africans to vote for the PAC and to remove “thieves” from power. “We can’t have a country of coalitions, where members testify against each other. Let’s vote against people who don’t provide services. “If we have a government that steals every day, what will stop them from stealing votes? “We don’t trust the IEC. They should have a transparent ballot box.” He said the liberation of Africans depended on party agents guarding votes. “If the DA governs, our fallen heroes in other countries will never return. We must also punish those fakes in the EFF. No land will be returned to Africans through the Freedom Charter. They are agents funded by a white boss. “Go and vote so we can be represented in parliament. We don’t have a choice other than to unite for the reunification of Africa.”
