The Hawks and Ekurhuleni Metro cops have hit a major blow to
Jozi’s drug and rhino trade. Three suspects between the ages of 38 and 43 were arrested in
two different drug incidents in Soweto and Kempton Park on Sunday. The Johannesburg Serious Organised Investigation team seized
R5.5 million worth of methaqualone powder which was going to be utilised to
manufacture mandrax inside the suspect’s house. Cops spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the team
discovered the secret laboratory and confiscated chemicals, machinery which
included a table presser, a mixer, weighing scales and containers. Mulamu said the suspect will appear before the Protea
Magistrates Court on Monday and will be charged with manufacturing and supply
of drugs. Meanwhile, on Thursday evening SANEB members seized
suspected heroine, crystal meth and cocaine worth approximately R4.4 million
carefully concealed inside two wine crates at a house in Birchleigh, Kempton
Park. The package was destined for Amsterdam via OR Tambo
International Airport. Two suspects aged 38 and 43 were arrested. They will appear
on Monday before the Kempton Park Magistrates Court charged with dealing in
drugs. In a separate incident R38 million worth of rhino horns were
also seized by the Serious Organised Investigation team at a warehouse in
