THE ANC in Mpumalanga has denied claims that Premier Refilwe Mtshweni, who has been nominated to occupy the same position again, will reshuffle her cabinet and bring in new faces. The party’s acting secretary in the province, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali, said the list of new MECs making the rounds on social media was fake. According to the list, community safety MEC Pat Ngomane will move to the health department, while his department will now be headed by Mbombela municipal speaker Mandla Msibi. Ntshalintshali saidthe list was bogus and was never discussed by the structures. She said the people circulating the list were trying to create instability in the province. “I can’t say what the list looks like but what I know is that women and young people should be represented,” she said. “We still have to go through internal processes and make recommendations for MECs, which the premier will have to approve.” Ntshalintshali said they would have a consultative meeting this week to discuss the issue of MECs and members of the National Council of Provinces. Last year the party failed to hold the elective conference, following several postponements, meaning that it could only elect a replacement after the national election. The province was supposed to hold the council to fill vacant positions of the chair, the deputy and an additional member, which was postponed four times this year. The positions became vacant when former premier David Mabuza was elected deputy president and deputy chairwoman Violet Siwela was elected as an NEC additional member. So far, the organisation hasn’t confirmed the date when the elective conference will be held.
