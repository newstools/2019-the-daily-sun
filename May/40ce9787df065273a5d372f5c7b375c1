FIVE traditional healers last week went to Massachusetts in the US, where the Ragon Institute honoured their work. Non-profit organisation Integration of TB in Education and Care for HIV/Aids, which is part of the institute, boosts HIV and TB services in KZN. Nelisiwe Zuma, Sibongile Madlala, Tholakele Memela, Ngenzeni Mbhele and Nokuvela Nkambule make up the Edendale Hospital-based training team. They prepare other healers to be a link between residents and government clinics and to make sure patients seek medical care. Ngenzeni said it was an honour to be a part of the team that went to the US. She said they were taken on research lab tours, followed by a tour of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Tholakele said: “We were asked questions about our work, as well as about being part of the organisation’s team and supporting the department.” Founder Krista Dong said: “Since 2009, we’ve been training traditional health practitioners as HIV counsellors who provide support to patients who use traditional and Western health services.” Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: “Traditional healers influence patients in seeking health. It makes sense to convert them to health ambassadors.”
