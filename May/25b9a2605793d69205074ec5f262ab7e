HEARTBROKEN mum Ncebakazi Gxiva (46) lost her daughter Lithemba (7) in a shack fire. The incident happened when a fire destroyed several shacks and killed two people in Kosovo squatter camp, Cape Town, last week. Now Ncebakazi needs help to bury her child. “We are appealing for help so we can give my child a dignified send-off,” Ncebakazi said. “She was taken away from us in a gruesome way.” Residents said the fire was started by a drunk resident in the early hours of Sunday morning. Ncebakazi said she was in so much pain because she could not save her daughter. “I always think that something could have been done to save her life, but the fire was too strong. I don’t want to blame myself anymore. Maybe it was meant to be.” She said her daughter was sweet and enjoyed making jokes. “She has left a huge gap in the family. We will miss her a lot.” Jean-Pierre Smith, a member of the mayoral committee for safety and security, said the family could get help from the mayor’s office. “The mayor’s fund is able to help in such circumstances.”
