SAFTA- award winning actress and Two-time Emmy nominee Thuso Mbedu is already a household name in Mzansi - and she is on her way to becoming an even  bigger star in Hollywood. She will star as a lead actress in an Amazon series. Although the talented actress has finally gotten her big in the notoriously tough Hollywood, the star has some advice for those, who wish to crack it just like her. Now the 27-year-old actress took to her Twitter account to offer some advice to those wishing to be in her shoes one day. "Actors/Actresses of Mzansi (the country not the channel): please keep your material (a reel ideally) up to date and searchable online (youtube is great) as you never know who will be looking," she wrote. She further said that when casting directors look for new talent, they want to see a reel.  She tweeted: "Also, casting producers and directors etc are more interested in looking at a reel when exploring new talent than an Instagram page.As you were".
