MOURNERS camping at Lily Mine, in Mpumalanga outside Barberton, have accused police of being brutal. “They pushed us and told us to voetsak,” said Beauty Mavuso (61), Pretty Nkambule’s mum. “They destroyed the tent we were sleeping in.” Pretty, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyirenda have been buried underground since early 2016. The container they were working from plunged into a sinkhole. Only 76 mineworkers were rescued after the accident. On Tuesday, more than 16 cop cars came and five former miners were bust. The miners were later released after being told to co-operate with the law. Mourners and families of trapped miners have been camping on the mine’s premises, demanding its speedy reopening. Cops have been accused of assaulting the gogos. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “We instituted the court order sent to us. “There was no fight between us and them.”
