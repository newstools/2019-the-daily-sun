MZANSI men are ready to pack their bags and head to eSwatini. This is after fake news broke that eSwatini’s King Mswati III apparently ordered men in his country to marry more than two wives or face jail. The story was first published by the Zambian Observer and was soon picked up by several online publications. READ: SWATI KING: I NEVER SAID MARRY MANY WIVES! The story stated that Mswati declared that from June, men will be required to marry at least two or more wives or go to prison. This is because the country is facing a serious problem as there are more women than men. The story went as far as claiming the eSwatini government assured men it would pay for their marriage ceremonies and buy them houses. Upon hearing this news, Mzansi men were ready to head to eSwatini. But they were disappointed when the king said the reports were untrue. The government said: “The current dispatch titled ‘Marry more wives or face jail’, quoting the king, is not only an insult to the monarchy but a disgrace to journalism. “His Majesty has not made any pronouncement to that effect as it has never been an issue raised by eMaswati.” The government appealed for morality, responsible behaviour and professionalism among journalists and the general public. “It would be unfortunate if journalism and social media are turned into character assassination platforms and springboards to ridicule individuals and leaders.”
