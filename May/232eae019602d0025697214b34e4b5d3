At his graduation on Thursday, Mondli Xulu (23) wore overalls and carried a banner begging for a job. Mondli is an honours graduate from the University of Zululand. Originally from Doringkop in KwaDakuza, he has degrees in development studies and environmental planning. Mondli told Daily Sun he didn’t wear a suit as he didn’t want to spend too much money on his outfit. He also wanted to stand out to potential employers. “I’ve sent out about 200 job and internship applications since my first graduation in 2015 but I’ve only had one four-month internship with our local municipality,” he said. Mondli said he saw his graduation ceremony as an opportunity to plead for work. “I bought these overalls for R350 to show I want to work. The boots were donated to me by a farmer I once worked for.” Mondli said he was willing to work for any amount. “I’m not picky. I’m willing to work for a R3 000 internship or even for R1 500,” he said.
