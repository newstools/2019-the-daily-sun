ZAKHELE Dlamini heard on Tuesday that he would spend the rest of his life in prison. The 28-year-old was convicted of rape and kidnapping by the Piet Retief Regional Court. Dlamini kidnapped and raped a 22-year-old woman in Eziphunzini, Mpumalanga, last year. Regional National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the victim was walking home from her aunt’s house in September when she came across Dlamini. The victim felt there was something wrong and screamed for help from passing motorists but no one listened. She was dragged to Dlamini’s house where he raped her and kept her against her will until the next morning. When she was released, she opened a case and identified him. During sentencing, the court found there was no reason to sentence Dlamini to fewer years than the minimum for the crimes he was convicted for. He was found not fit to possess a firearm or work with children and the court ordered his name to be put on the sexual offences register. Provincial acting director of public prosecutions, Matric Luphondo said: “This is a clear message that gender based violence will not be tolerated. The NPA will continue to ensure that children and women in our society are protected.”
