MORE and more women have been trapping men with korobela love potions. Although Daily Sun has written several stories about it going wrong, the trend seems to continue. The SunTeam recently went out to ask women about their thoughts on korobela. Mavis Sithole (33) from Leondale, Ekurhuleni, said she once used korobela because she was worried about losing her man. “The problem started when I stopped loving him. I had to get that thing removed.” Sphimphiwe Mthembu (36) said she trapped her man with korobela because he was a cheater. “I love my man and I was not going to lose him to another woman.” Sibongile Nyathi (28) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said she tried it and it went wrong as her man started cheating. “I still regret giving him korobela because I lost him to another woman. I strongly discourage women from doing this,” she said. Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi warned women that korobela caused diseases. “This isn’t good. Love is in a person’s heart, not in their body. You need to stop using this,” he said.
