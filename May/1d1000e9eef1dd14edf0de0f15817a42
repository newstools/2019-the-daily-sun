THIRTY women are behind bars after they allegedly defrauded Sassa beneficiaries. The women allegedly asked for money from people and then helped them to qualify for grants. On Monday, police arrested the women in Botshabelo, Free State. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “Various fraudulent documents and stamps were recovered. A 41-year-old woman is the alleged mastermind behind the scam. She targeted vulnerable unsuspecting people and issued fraudulent doctor’s referral letters, qualifying them to apply for grants. “Unsuspecting victims were made to believe the woman was a doctor’s assistant authorised to perform these duties.” She said the 30 women, aged between 20 and 56, were expected to appear in the Botshabelo Magistrates Court soon. Free State Sassa spokeswoman Sandy Godlwana said more arrests were expected. “Sassa officials are also linked to this network of fraud. We view these criminal acts as an attack on government’s attempt to eradicate poverty. We assure beneficiaries that no stone will be left unturned until all culprits are put behind bars,” said Godlwana. Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe urged people who are part of the scam or fraudulent beneficiaries to come forward. Beneficiaries are advised to call Sassa on 0800 60 1011 if they are offered grants in exchange for money, no matter how little they are charged.
