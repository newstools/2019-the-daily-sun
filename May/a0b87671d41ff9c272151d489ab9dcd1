BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has wished Mamelodi Sundowns the best of luck in their quest to reach the Caf Champions League final. The Brazilians face Wydad Casablanca in a war of attrition at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday, looking to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the semifinal first leg defeat in Rabat last week. ”They did well in the first leg. The away goal has given them a huge advantage going into this return game,” said Baxter. ”Wydad will be very nervous about how they approach the game. They know Sundowns have individuals players to unlock you if you tried parking the bus for 90 minutes.”If they go gung-ho and put pressure on Sundowns, they'll find it hugely difficult ”I expect Sundowns to go through. I do certainly wish Pitso and his boys all the best and hope they go through.” Baxter has further praised the club’s significant growth in the tournament, noting their experience. ”I think their players have become very, very adept at the Caf competition and their players are very experienced,” he said. ”Of course, we could use that experience in the national team.”Pitso has got a great balance within his team and has changed the way they play slightly. ”Watching Barcelona is interesting... watching Sundowns is also interesting.”Yet Baxter hastened to point out that the Afcon and the Champions League present different challenges for the players. ”There is nothing like playing for your national team. If you asked Tiger Woods what is most difficult thing he's ever done he'll tell you it's playing in the Ryder Cup, not playing in the US Open,” said the Briton. ”But taking a penalty for your national team with the nation eyes on you is a different form of pressure.”I don't think we should copy anybody we have different players. But the principle of what they've done is something to learn from.”
