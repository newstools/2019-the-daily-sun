IN bright sunlight, Sundowns took the Absa Premiership trophy on a victory tour around Tshwane. Fans from Mamelodi, Atteridgeville, Hammanskraal, Ga-Rankuwa, Mmakau, Mabopane, Winterveld and the CBD were waiting to greet them. The Brazilians won the league for the fourth time in six years in a highly contested league which ended on Saturday. Phakamani Mahlambi scored a solitary goal against Free State Stars. The team walked away with R10 million, a trophy and medals. Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe said fans made the team great. “Today is about thanking the people of Tshwane who love football,” he told Daily Sun. Goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene said they were disappointed when they lost the CAF Champions League, but winning the Absa league felt great. “We worked extra hard. I know we deserved it,” he said. Mweene said it was great to see so many people celebrating with them. Sibusiso Vilakazi, Oupa Manyisa, Cuthbert Malajila and Jeremy Brockie were part of the team’s cup winning celebration. Rapper Kwesta and singer Dr Malinga kept the fans dancing during the parade. Kwesta said: “This was an exciting event. It’s a great moment for fans, musicians and the team.” Fan General Maluleke (71) said: “I’m delighted for the glittering silverware that has come to Sundowns and Tshwane.”
