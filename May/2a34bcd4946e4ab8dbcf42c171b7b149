ONE of the Nissan pick-ups you should not overlook if you’re looking for a workhorse is the 4x4 NP300 manual diesel version. This was a surprise deliverly for us to try out on the road. And we were wowed! This one has come a long way – from the Nissan family going back four decades. Its body is still tough and rugged but under the bonnet is an absolute wonder. Looking at it and its sister the Navara, you might overlook what seems like the old fashioned NP300, but it is a twin-cab meant for hard work. Although we didn’t go to a farm to put its load capacity to the test, we loved what seemed like an old crock that in fact had a modern touch. The first thing you notice is its simple but roomy cabin. I didn’t plan to listen to the radio until my 15-year-old son played a DVD on the small, but crystal-clear screen. I’m sure farmers will be lining up at dealerships to check out this new machine. I also loved the snorkel running outside the left front-passenger door. That will be an attraction for many farmers whose job is to get dirty in an effort to feed the nation. The NP300 might seem ancient, its new chassis and 4WD system and improved performance are second to none. The engine is also trimmed down to 2.3 litres – a reduction of around 200cc. I didn’t expect to get a comfy ride from the new NP300 but it was the best ride for any unloaded one-tonner. Bumpy gravel roads were no match for this mean machine. The NP300 handles the road extremely well. Everything, from the gear lever and pedals to the steering wheel is responsive. You get exactly what you’ve bargained for. This includes approaching sharp bends in full throttle. Enjoy the ride!
