Aaron Ntuli (70) always prayed someone would build him a proper home one day. And now his prayers have finally been answered, because a three-roomed house is now being planned. Local businessman Ishwar Ramlutechmam is the person who came to madala’s rescue. Aaron, from Umfolozi, in northern KZN, said he could not wait for his house to be finished. “I’ve been living in a crumbling house for several years. When it rains, I wake up and stand in a corner to avoid the rain that comes gushing in. In winter, the cold keeps me awake all night. I normally sleep during the day, when there is sun,” said madala. He said his life was turned upside down in 2000 when he suffered a stroke and had to stop working. “I didn’t have money to fix my mud house, nor did I have the strength to fix it myself because of my age and illness.” He said he could not wait to move into his new house. “When I saw materials being delivered and the builders taking measurements, I didn’t believe my eyes. Part of me thought it was all a dream. I thought someone was going to wake me up from a deep sleep. I’m so excited,” he said. He has two adult sons. “One got a job and abandoned me. The other is living with me but is not employed,” he said. Ramlutechmam said it was sad to see people living in such dreadful conditions. “I urge fellow South Africans who are blessed with plenty to extend a helping hand to people like madala. We must live by the African proverb, “Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu” (a person is a person because of other people),” he said.
