STHEMBISO Zulu cannot sleep at night. The councillor said he has been terrified since two Metro cops were killed outside his home on Monday night . The cops were guarding his house in the Bhambayi area of Inanda, Durban. Zulu said he was at home when the incident happened. “We heard several gunshots at the gate and immediately called the police. We later discovered that the cops who were guarding my house were fatally wounded.” He said the municipality sent the cops to his place 10 months ago when residents started protesting outside his home. A police source said three unknown men were seen leaving the scene after the shooting. “A cop died in the police van while another one died outside the vehicle. Two service pistols were taken from the cops.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two murder cases were opened at Phoenix cop shop. Durban Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said they were saddened by the incident. “We have sent a team to visit the victims’ families. We have also activated a joint operation with the cops to search for the killers and recover the pistols.”
