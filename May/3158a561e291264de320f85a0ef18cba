PASSIONATE young people travelled from far and wide to audition for parts in a new production of Sarafina!. Hundreds lined up outside the Soweto Theatre on Friday to perform a song, a monologue and a dance piece. Many had arrived in the early hours of the morning – long before the auditions started at 9am – because they wanted to be first in the queue to impress the judges, These included Vusi Majola, Thabo Gwadiso and director Nhlanhla Ngema. Drama student Marly Mahlangu (22) said she travelled all the way from Mpumalanga with her father and arrived just after 6am. “I’ve put a lot of work into practising for this production because it’s an iconic musical. I’m confident I’ll be selected for a role,” she said. “Sarafina! is one of my favourite movies. Although I wasn’t part of the struggle, I feel I was there because of the movie.” The play, which was later made into an international movie, was written by famous playwright Mbongeni Ngema. It tells the story of the Soweto uprising. Ngema said: “We want to beef up the show by bringing new faces, new talent and new energy. It’s going to be another wonderful production. “We’re looking for good singers and dancers, as well as actors, because when you do musical theatre, you need to be able to do all three.” He said the judges had spotted some exciting talent. “We’re overwhelmed by the numbers,” Nene said.
