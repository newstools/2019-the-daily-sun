THUGS robbed the school on 19 May and then again last Thursday! Parents at the Lesedi Secondary School near Silverton, Tshwane, believe the robbers lived close to the school. SGB chairman Moses Majola told Daily Sun thugs stole from the school twice in one week and managed to steal valuable electronic equipment. He said the school security also didn’t know who was stealing from the school. Majola said on the first occasion on 19 May the thugs stole three computers, a smart board, two monitors, three cellphones and two speakers. Last Thursday they stole a small monitor. “We suspect the community around the school is behind the break-ins,” he said. “Whenever the thugs steal, the two security guards who work at night are absent from work.” Majola said they don’t have the money to replace the stolen items. He said the thugs used grinding machines to cut through the burglar bars. In March thugs stole a lawnmower. The school is planning a meeting to talk about their security. Boschkop police spokesman Constable Yeroboam Mbatsane confirmed that police are investigating three cases of theft after Lesedi Secondary School was burgled. “At the moment no suspects have been arrested. “We are pleading with members of the community to assist with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects,” said Mbatsane.
