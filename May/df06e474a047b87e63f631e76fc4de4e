The Deputy President of the ANC David Mabuza will be sworn in as an ANC Member of Parliament on Tuesday. The swearing-in ceremony will be conducted by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng and is scheduled to take place around 16:00 at Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guest House, Pretoria Mabuza postponed his swearing in last week because he wanted to clear his name first before serving in parliament. The ANCâ€™s integrity commission report had flagged Mabuza in its report as one of the people who should not represent the ANC in parliament.
