LIKE most political parties which had their final rallies around the country, Cope also held a get together at the weekend. But the party couldn’t fill the tent in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, on Sunday. In some of the pictures and videos circulating on social media, a few singing people can be seen entering the tent. There were a few chairs, but most of them were empty. Dennis Bloem, Cope secretary of communications and Gauteng premier candidate, said their numbers went down after their crippling leadership problems in 2014. “We have worked very hard now and are going to surprise many people on election day. “People on the ground see Cope as the only hope for South Africa.” He said they conducted a door-to- door campaign and their president came to thank the foot soldiers personally. Party leader Mosiuoa Lekota said they will build houses for the people. They will get back the money wasted on Bosasa and use it to equip schools. On Facebook, Lebravo Lewatle said: “This looks like a family get together.” Mahlatse Khakhathi said: “My family gathering is better than this.” Betty King said: “Lekota likes to get personal and listen to the people.”
