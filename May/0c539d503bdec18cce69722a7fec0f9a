THE family of Khensani Sambo are unhappy with how the cops handled her missing person’s case. The remains of the 20-year-old, who was last seen in March, were found in Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday. Her gogo Jowie Mona (67) told Daily Sun the family had to take matters into their own hands. They traced the suspect who allegedly killed her through a cellphone. She said they found the man and he pointed out where Khensani’s remains were. Jowie said when Khensani didn’t come home, she went to open a case but cops told her to not worry as she was probably with her boyfriend. She said they went to cops several times but was not helped. “Havyview police don’t take us seriously.” She said she wanted the suspect to rot in jail. Residents recently burned down his house. Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said a 22-year-old man was taken in for questioning. “The allegation that police were not co-operative is not true. We were working together with the family to find the victim. If they are not satisfied, they can lodge a complaint with management.”
