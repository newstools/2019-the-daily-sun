THE Premier Soccer League have confirmed new format of the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) ahead of the new season. The MDC, which has proven a platform for budding talents such as Siphesihle Ndlovu of Maritzburg United as well as Amajita star midfielder Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, previously saw the 16 PSL Reserve sides go toe to toe for the title and overseas trip in 15 rounds of fixtures. However, from next season which is set to commence on the weekend of 9-10 August with a big festival and finish around March-April,will see 30 rounds of fixtures. That will allow in each team to play one another twice in a 'home' and 'away' format. In the new format, MultiChoice Diski Shield will also be remodeled into a Top 8 knockout competition for the clubs finishing in the top8 positions. "I've understood that nothing beats a competitive environment, which will give an opportunity especially to the youth aged 12-21," said Khoza. "We've discovered that development requires visibility, and the Multichoice Diski Challenge is no exception. "We know now that the PSL is content generators. In a shrinking edia space, if the content is not appealing, we are good for nothing. We want to be top of mind. "I want to announce that Multichoice has agreed that as from the August 9, the MDC will now be played first and second round. It will start on 9-10 August with a big festival and finish around March-April. "The Diski Shiled will then follow and end around July."
