ATHEMBELE Makwethu (17) from Khayelitsha went missing in March. His mum Regina Gani said: “It hurts me every day. For the past two months, since my son’s disappearance, I have not been able to eat properly .” Athembele went missing from his home on 4 March. Regina said she reported the matter to Khayelitsha police on 8 March. When she went to find out about the case after two weeks, she was sent from pillar to post, she claims. “Cops sent me from one office to another. They battled to find the docket and when they finally found it, they realised it was incomplete.” She said the case was given to a new officer, but she never got any updates. Regina’s employer Anja Venter said: “It’s unacceptable for cops to tell a mother of a missing minor to go and look for her child in prison.” Police spokesman Frederick Van Wyk said: “The complainant should report the matter to the station management, and it will be forwarded to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for investigation.”
