Gatvol Mozambican citizens from various parts of Mpumalanga, took to the streets on Tuesday led by Undlekahle Khoza and John Mdluli to demand IDs. They handed over a memorandum of grievances to Mhala Home Affairs offices demanding that Minister Sibyabonga Qwele unblock all blocked IDs. “The Minister must unblock all blocked IDs to allow these victims to do transactions and be part of this country’s economy,” said Khoza. They said the department should guard against xenophobic tendencies and issue birth certificates and IDs to all pupils and those who passed matric. Their children wanted to be included in the school system as well. Khoza said they would give the minister 14 working days to address all their concerns and if he failed, they would embark on rolling mass action. He further said most foreigners in Mzansi are either immigrants working in the mines or refugees who left after the Frelimo and Renamo civil war in Mozambique. Desperate dad Joseph Mashaba (49), now living in New Forest, outside Thulamahashe said he can’t find a job or support his family since the department blocked his ID. “My four children do not have birth certificates, and this has affected our lives in a bad way. Patrick Mathebula (26) said: “I passed matric in 2017 but I can’t study towards an LLB at university because I don’t have an ID.” Mhala Home Affairs manager Robert Khoza signed the memorandum and said he would deliver it to the relevant body. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said refugees do not hold permanent status in the country that has sheltered them. “In terms of UN law, once the situation normalises in their country of origin, they have to be repatriated home.”
