 The BMW M5 has been around for 35 years! When BMW slapped an
engine from their M1 sports car into a four-door family sedan. They created the
first ever super-saloon. To celebrate 35 years since introducing the M5. BMW has unveiled
the M5 35 Year special. The Edition 35 Jahre is based on the current BMW M5
Competition. Unlike the M5 30 Jahre special edition, the Edition 35 doesn't get
any power bump. So you get the same 4.4-litre M TwinPower Turbo engine that
produces 460kW (625bhp) and 750Nm of torque as in the Competition.  Power is still going to all four wheels via an 8-Speed automatic
transmission. You get M xDrive that allows you to choose whether you want power
going to both the front and rear axle or just the rear. The latter is more
suitable for track application because 460kW going to the rear axle in a
2-tonne car can be too much to handle on public roads. Most of the changes in the Edition are just visual. Outside you
get BMW's Individual special finish in Frozen Dark Grey metallic. BMW says that
the paintwork has special pigmentation that can create a silk matt surface
impression. All I know is it looks great.  There are special 20-inch alloy wheels in Graphite Grey to set
your M5 apart from the other. The standard brake callipers are finished in
special high-gloss black. If you opt for the Ceramic units, they'll be finished
in gold. Inside there's Gold finish to make you feel extra polished. The
aluminium carbon structure gold anodized trim is added to the M multifunction
seats and the BMW Individual Merino full leather trim in black with beige
contrast seams.  The Edition 35 Jahre also gets BMW's all-new digital
instrumentation cluster with a rev counter that goes counterclockwise in
addition to iDrive 7.0 There's also a plaque that read 1/350 on the cupholder cover. The
doorsills also have laser engraved M5 Edition 35 Jahre inscriptions. Yes, only
350 of the cars will be made for the entire world.
