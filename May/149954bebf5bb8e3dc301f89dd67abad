VILLAGERS were shocked when they saw a helicopter hovering in the sky on Saturday. The unheard of event in Dididi, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, was for a wedding that no one would ever forget. The lavish wedding ceremony of Tshifhiwa Mabuduga and Tondani Ramano was the talk of all the villages in the area. The two celebrated their marriage with a luxurious event at the Richards Country Club Itsani. Among the guests was well-known businessman David Mureri, whose Mercedes was used to transport the couple to the hotel after Tondani and her father arrived in a helicopter. After the ceremony, the newlyweds were taken for a helicopter tour. Resident Mashudu Mudau, who attended the wedding, said she had never seen anything like it before. “This is something that won’t be forgotten in the area. Most of us had never seen a helicopter up close before. We are very grateful to the couple for making this happen,” she said. Tshifhiwa said it took them four months to prepare for their big day. “We wanted to do things differently and we hope many young people are inspired to believe there is still hope in marriage,” he said.
