THEY say they were taken from Israel to Egypt, where life is hard. Now they want to go back home! This is the touching cry of residents in Tshilamba, Limpopo. They say life was good when their area still fell under the old Mutale municipality. But things changed for the worse when the municipality was dissolved and the area incorporated into Thulamela Municipality by the Municipal Demarcation Board. Residents who formed the Tshilamba Concerned Group say life was better before they were absorbed by Thulamela in 2016.. The group’s chairman, Benedict Nalana, said although residents had been in constant talks with Thulamela Municipality to complain about basic services like water and gravel roads, nothing had come of their pleas. “We’re suffering and no one seems to care. Ever since our area was taken over by Thulamela, nothing good has happened. Poor service has become part of our lives,” Nalana said. He said the old Mutale municipality was wrongly dissolved as it was done without consulting residents. Nalana said consultations were held in faraway Thulamela, where residents of Tshilamba could not go because of the costly cost of transport. “We want our old municipality back. It was better under Mutale,” he said. Co-operative Governance and Human Settlements MEC Jerry Ndou said the government did not have the power to change boundaries. He said it depended on the demarcation board. He urged residents to make submissions to the board for consideration in 2021.
