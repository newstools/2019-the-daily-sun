A MEMBER of the family was brutally murdered in his flat in 2015. Now, almost four years later, the Van Wyks of Heidedal in Mangaung, Free Statewant to know if they have to kill to see justice served. Their story was published in Daily Sun under the headline: “We are not afraid!” on 10 December 2018. The family wanted closure. They believe a bribe was involved to stop 34-year-old Theo van Wyk’s murder being probed. And when they started to ask questions, they received photos in the post of his bloodied body. That’s when the cops allegedly stopped the murder probe. Left with more questions than answers, the family took up the matter at police headquarters. But the new investigating officer allegedly also failed the family. That was when a third cop was allocated to the case. But he, too, was allegedly unhelpful. Theo’s sister, Theonie (40), said the matter, like Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa’s case, was suspiciously dragging on for far too long. “Should I kill someone to get justice? I feel the police are failing us as a family. But at least the new investigating officer, the fourth, is doing more work than the previous ones,” she said. “He started being flexible. That gave me hope. Unlike the others, he did visit our home for updates. But, suddenly, he went quiet like the others. He later told me he was awaiting the prosecutor’s decision. “It has been more than three years and eight months. I have had enough of the police! I don’t think my brother is resting in peace. I want answers.” She said she didn’t understand why the family has to follow up on the cops. Free State NPA spokesman Shuping Phaladi said there was no time frame for an investigation. Phaladi said: “I advise the family to ask the investigating officer who the prosecutor is. Depending on their workload, the prosecutor will tell the family the estimated time for a decision.”
