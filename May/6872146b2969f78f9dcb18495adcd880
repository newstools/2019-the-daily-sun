According to STATS SAÂ roughly half of South African men and women between the ages of 18 and 34 are single. The 2018 General Household Survey (GHS) states that the high number of single people between the ages of 18 and 34 may lead to "social and economic consequences" in the country. North West had the highest incidence of single person households, with a third being single person households. Nuclear households that are comprised of parents and children made up 39,1% of all households. The survey shows that 37,6% of households consisted of two generations while 14,2% contained at least three generations. Skip generation households that matched grandparents with grandchildren made up 5,1% of all households. The latter were most common in Limpopo (8,7%) and Eastern Cape (8,5%). The study shows that 37,9% ofhouseholds were headed by females. "Although traditional family structures are changing, they remain very important in countries such as SA, where large proportions of the population are subject to debilitating poverty and unemployment and institutional support is inadequate."
