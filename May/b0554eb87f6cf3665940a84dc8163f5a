PEOPLE around Mzansi were furious after photos went viral on social media on Monday. The pictures show a police woman being poked. But people were not angry with the woman, but with whoever leaked the private photos. Jabu Dlodlo wrote on Facebook: “He is disgusting. How can he embarrass someone like that?” It was not clear when or where the photos were taken but rumour has it the suspect was let go after a sex bribe. The caption said the man threatened to post the photos on social media if the woman didn’t do exactly what he asked. National police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said: “We are still trying to find out if she is indeed a cop.” He said if she was in fact a police officer, steps would be taken. “We can’t rule out the possibility that it might be someone who happened to have a police uniform and wore it for the pictures,” he said. Naidoo said the person who took the photos and posted them on social media had committed a crime.
