AN OFF-DUTY Durban Metro cop took his wife shopping. Little did he know he would end up in a life-threatening incident. The cop, who is stationed at Durban Harbour, is today lying in hospital with a bullet wound in his leg. This is after a group of men attacked him in his black Mercedes-Benz at the KwaMashu shopping centre on Sunday. Bullets flew and shoppers ducked for cover. Amid the scuffle, the cop was shot in the leg. It is not clear whether the skelms wanted to steal his gun or take his car. According to a witness, the cop had just parked his car in the centre’s parking lot when a white Golf 7 parked behind him. Several men jumped out and stormed the car. “They hit him and tried to throttle him. He fought back but they shot him in the leg. He pulled out his gun and pointed it at one of them while lying on the ground. “Three of the men escaped, but the other three remained behind to try and rescue their mate,” said the witness. Members of the police who happened to be at the shopping centre at the time swung into action. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a man was shot in the leg at KwaMashu shopping centre. “The suspects opened fire, wounding the victim in the leg. Three suspects aged between 24 and 35 were arrested for attempted murder. “They will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon,” said Gwala.
