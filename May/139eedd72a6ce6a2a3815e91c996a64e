WHILE most mums were celebrating Mother’s Day yesterday, Nomusa Nkosi was mourning her son Mduduzi. The woman from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said she felt her 28-year-old son was punishing her when he committed suicide on Thursday. Mduduzi was found dead in his room, a day after he told his mum on WhatsApp he was going to kill himself. In the messages which Daily Sun has seen Mduduzi says he is unhappy that his parents disapprove of his girlfriend and sends them a picture of rat poison. “He was at work when he sent me the messages and I was very happy when he came home later,” Nomusa said. “I spent the night stalking him on WhatsApp to see if he was online.” But she found Mduduzi dead on his bed the next morning. Nomusa and Mduduzi’s dad Bongani said they didn’t approve of him moving his girlfriend into his room without their permission. “When he first moved her in, she was only 15. “What kind of parents would we be if we just allowed a minor to live with our son? “She repeatedly lied to us about her family. “We did everything to make sure she had a bright future while trying to find the family,” she said. Bongani said they even helped the girl register for social grants and to enrol at school. “But whenever Mduduzi was not around, she would roam the streets with friends and use drugs. This led to their break-up earlier this year,” he said. “It’s difficult being a parent and it breaks our hearts that things turned out this way. We feel as if we are being punished for no reason,” he said. Police said an inquest docket has been opened.
