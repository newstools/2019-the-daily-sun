WHEN videos and pictures of a burning bus were shared on social media, some said there were dead and injured people. But according to North West police spokesman Captain Aafje Botma, the claims are false. He said the bus had an electrical fault and it caught fire. “The bus was burning on the side of the road. No one was injured and there was no protest or violent action,” he said. Residents said they were shocked when they saw posts on Facebook. Anah Ratlhogo (25) said they were not happy with how the people had labelled them. “It makes us angry when people think we could just burn a bus from nowhere and for nothing,” said Ratlhogo. She said they had complaints but did not protest or act violently this year. “It’s true that we’re not happy with a lot of things in our area, but we haven’t protested. We didn’t burn that bus.” Another resident, Thabo Monama (33), said social media users don’t know what to joke about. “To some people this might look like a joke, but it’s not, and it’s tainting the image of our area. “We’re not violent people. We wouldn’t even hurt a fly. “These people who wrote that our people burnt the bus must be dealt with.” Monica Leballo (58) saw the burning bus. “I was watching from a distance, I was worried there were people burning inside, but when I heard no one was injured I was relieved.”
