A MAN suspected of being a serial rapist and killer met a violent death on Monday. More than 150 people in Govan Mbeki kasi, Port Elizabeth, tied Ntsikelelo Maqoma’s hands and burned him alive! The 40-year-old man was accused of beating Vuyiswa Gqabaza to death before raping her corpse. After he was caught, women from the kasi took turns beating him with sticks before necklacing him. Standing around his burning body, they chanted, “The dog is dead”. A community leader said the last time Vuyiswa was seen alive, she was being beaten in a fight over booze money. “On Thursday last week, their 18-year-old son, who lives in KwaDwesi with relatives, went to look for his mum and found her dead,” the leader claimed. “After he alerted the community, we confronted the boyfriend. He pulled a knife on us and escaped but we tracked him down after we put it on social media. “A few years ago, he stabbed his mother’s boyfriend to death. He also raped his cousin and his own mother.” Another woman (30) claimed: “He killed her and kept her corpse in the house for four days to rape it repeatedly.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “At about 5pm on Monday, Ntsikelelo Maqoma (40) was beaten to death and burned by a mob. “His death came after his girlfriend’s body was found badly decomposed in his house. An inquest was opened to determine the cause of death.”
