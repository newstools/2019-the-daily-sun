ETHEKWINI municipal workers have vowed to bring Durban to a standstill again today. Workers have demanded to be moved to payment grade 10 just like former Umkhonto we Sizwe members. They caused chaos in the city on Tuesday when they blocked busy Anton Lembede and Pixley kaSeme streets. They camped outside the city hall from morning until evening, waiting for mayor Zandile Gumede to address them. South African Municipal Workers’ Union regional chairman Abraham Mchunu said water and sanitation workers decided to down tools after they heard that MK veterans were promoted. He lashed out at management for not treating workers equally. Themba Mavundla, the veterans’ provincial chairman, said veterans sacrificed their jobs when they joined MK and didn’t come back with a cent, so they needed to recover the lost years. Their salaries went up from R6 000 to R20 000. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said all promotions were on hold. Premier Willies Mchunu appointed a task team led by Ravi Pillay.
