RESULTS of the election which ended at 9pm on Wednesday indicate the ANC’s leading the polls. It is followed by the DA, the EFF and surprisingly, the Freedom Front Plus. But the final results may be delayed due to irregularities identified in the voting. IEC KZN provincial chairman Mawethu Mosery yesterday said 17 voters were bust in Dannhauser, near Newcastle, one in Port Shepstone and two in Hluhluwe. IEC chief electoral officer Sy Mamabolo said they will conduct an urgent audit of voting stations where people may have voted twice. “The audit will cover a statistically representative sample of voting stations. He said the process has been endorsed by all parties participating in the election. “Despite these hiccups, the commission remained hopeful of announcing the results within seven days, as prescribed by law,” he said. Mamabolo said 45% of results had already been verified. By late afternoon the ANC had already hit the three million mark out of the six million votes counted, with the DA at just over a million and the EFF hovering above the 500 000 mark. Mamabolo said they will only announce results when they are confident of their accuracy and legitimacy. Commissioner Janet Love urged parties to come forward with detailed information about any double voting allegations. “We would like the allegations to be as specific as possible,” she said. “It is a huge slap in the face of the South African citizens.”
