DJ Rhee believes in helping people. The popular DJ whose real name is Rufus Moremi is hosting the DJ Rhee Benefit Show tomorrow at Kwa Lichaba in Orlando West, Soweto. He said the event will bring together the two things he loves most: music and people. DJ Rhee, who’s hosted TV shows on SABC1 and Soweto TV, has been feeding the homeless since 2014. He now wants to take his initiative a step further. He told SunBuzz: “I come from a church-going and praying family. “They taught me that compassion is the most important trait we have.” The DJ said he was also motivated by radio DJ and businessman, DJ Sbu. “When I was under DJ Sbu’s wing I used to see how he helped pupils get bursaries to further their studies. “When I saw how he changed people’s lives, I was inspired to do something as well.” DJ Rhee said it breaks his heart to see people begging for food so he started his initiative to help them. “I’ve been donating food to homeless people on the streets of Jozi for the past five years, and doing that has made me happy.” Rhee said this year, he also wants to make sure the people he feeds are warm in winter. “The money from the ticket sales will go towards this cause. “Winter is coming so I want to buy them clothes and blankets. “As soon as I can, I plan to build a homeless shelter where I can teach them skills which will help them make money and hustle for themselves,” he said. The line-up of the show includes DJ Sabby, R&B singer Skandi Kid, gqom group Dbn Nyts, Tholukuthi Hey hitmaker Killer Kau and rapper Siya Shezi.
