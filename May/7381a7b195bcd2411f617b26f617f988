WhatsApp users are being urged to update the app
immediately after it was hacked. WhatsApp is urging people to update the app immediately
after it was targeted by hackers installing sophisticated spyware on users'
phones, giving them access to a trove of data. Business Insider reports that the security vulnerability has been fixed in updated
versions of WhatsApp released in recent days, but some users will need to
manually update the app to get protected. It is not yet known how many of WhatsApp's 1.5 billion
users were targeted by the bad actors, who installed the surveillance
technology - developed by Israel's NSO Group - by phoning the target through
WhatsApp's call functionality. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, said: "WhatsApp
encourages people to upgrade to the latest version of our app, as well as keep
their mobile operating system up to date, to protect against potential targeted
exploits designed to compromise information stored on mobile devices."
