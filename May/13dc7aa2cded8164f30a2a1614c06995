SPAIN women’s national team have targeted their first ever win in the Fifa Women’s World Cup finals against Banyana Banyana in France next month. Laroja, who will participate in their second World Cup, are paired in Group B with Desiree Ellis’ side, who will be making their debut. The group is also made up of Germany and China.  The first match of most tournaments are always targeted as they set the tone and act as first step in enhancing chances of progressing to the knockout stages. Jorge Vilda’s side will open the tournament against Ellis’ Banyana in Le Havre on 8 June. They will be looking for their first win at the finals after failing to do so four years ago in their debut tournament in Canada. Banyana, China and Spain will be tussling it out for the second spot as Germany are among favourites to win the group. They have won the tournament twice and Olympic games once. Spain right-back and scientist, Ceila Jimenz Delgado, who has a degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Alabama, says they are on the mission with her country at the upcoming tournament. “It’s definitely a difficult group,” says the 23-year-old. “All those countries have been doing a really good job in the development of soccer. We just want to pay attention to the first game, those 90 minutes are crucial. “We’ve been waiting for this moment since 2015. We have learned so much in the years since that World Cup four years ago.” This must come as strong warning to Banyana, who are going to this tournament having not won in the last nine matches in all competitions. Their last victory was against Mali in the Cape Coast in the semi-final of the Women’s Afcon in Ghana in November last year. After Spain’s first game against South Africa, they’ll face second-ranked side Germany on the 12 June at Stade du hainaut, Valenciennes. They’ll wrap it up against China on 17 June.
