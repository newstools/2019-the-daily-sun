THE farmers around Umhlabuyalingana, near Manguzi in northern KZN, believe the donation of new bakkies to transport their produce will result in lots of growth. Now they can get their produce to large markets easily. The farmers attended the handover on Tuesday of three 8 ton trucks and two bakkies to help them move their produce. Bonginkosi Mabika (58) said they are happy because they have been making a living through farming, but they couldn’t reach large markets due to the expense of moving their produce. “These bakkies will help us make more money and expand the farms. Most of the people are unemployed in the area because there are no industries here so we have to depend on agriculture.” Another farmer Fikile Mthembu (45) said they were so happy to have a way to transport their produce to cities. “Now we can expand our farms and grow more produce as we will be able to reach more customers,” said Fikile. Local mayor Solomon Mkhombo encouraged people to farm as it was a way to eradicate poverty. “We need people who will go to university and study agriculture and logistics so that we can have fresh produce supplied to the rest of the province. “Agriculture is the future. This is the only way black people can get an equal share of this country’s economy. I know lots of you were using the old methods of farming. Now we need to develop warehouses so your kids can come back and develop family businesses,” said Mkhombo. Economic Development head Siza Sibande said the department has opened lots of opportunities for people to use the land. --
