THE mountain of bottles in front of Mohau’s house is so big it can be seen from the street. It looks as if it’s about to swallow his house. Mohau Molepe (45) sees nothing wrong with the bottles covering the yard in front of his house in Palm Ridge near Thokoza, in Ekurhuleni. He said it is his recycling business. His neighbours don’t think he’s recycling. They think he has created a nest for rats that run all over the area. Mohau wants his neighbours to be patient. “I have spoken to a recycling company and they promised to fetch the bottles,” he said. Most of the bottles are still whole and he said he will break them if he puts them in a recycling bin. “I don’t want to break them because they will cause even more untidiness and could even hurt people,” he said. “I have been surviving on recycling for the past 15 years. I collect paper and plastic as well, but I have decided to focus on bottles because companies encourage us to do this.” Mohau said he approached a local councillor but was told he must go to the municipality if he needed land to recycle. Themba Gadebe of the City of Ekurhuleni said there were steps that had to be followed if people wanted to a place to recycle. He said they must not use spaces that attracted rats.
