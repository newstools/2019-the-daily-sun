A COMMUNITY in Tembisa is benefitting from the Grassroot to communicate better and effect participatory democracy through technology. The NGO is a free mobile platform that works for any type of phone, striving to reach audiences otherwise left out of the national conversation. Founded in 2015, it allows communities to engage with their members, call meetings, vote, and create action lists – whether a small burial society or thousands of people mobilising for a rally. “Prior to Grassroot, if someone wanted to call a community gathering they had to hire a guy to go around on a bakkie the whole morning with a megaphone telling people about the meeting,” says Grassroot co-founder and spokesperson Luke Jordan. “A chat group wouldn’t work because still about half of people in informal settlements don’t have smartphones, or are usually out of data, and chat groups have size limits.” Jordan answers few questions about Grassroots Technology can help communities to overcome challenges in distributing information and getting people together. A community in Ivory Park, Tembisa, used our tools to organise themselves and define community priorities, in this case to raise funds themselves to install flushing toilets. As well as our app helping them with the basic organisational work, our field team has helped them create a crowdfunding campaign (using Thundafund). They met their goal of raising R70 000 in the campaign. Our app and our team has helped them transparently and accountably manage the funds and build the toilets. We run a modern web application on the Amazon Web Services Cloud, built on open source frameworks and tools. For security and privacy we use a variety of firewalls and standard vulnerability checks. We are most active in Gauteng, followed by KwaZulu-Natal and then Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the Free State. However we have users in all nine provinces.
