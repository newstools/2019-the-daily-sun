TOMORROW’S election will be safe, free and fair! This was the feedback from a group of sangomas who gathered at a mountain top to perform rituals. They aimed at appease the ancestors and ensure the polls run smoothly. The Greater Tshwane Traditional Faith Forum slaughtered a goat as part of the ritual. With the goat, four chickens, sorghum beer, snuff and bottles of whisky and brandy in hand, the traditional healers from across Tshwane climbed the mountain top near Ga-Rankuwa zone 6 on Saturday to plead with the ancestors that there should be no bloodshed on polling day. Dressed in traditional regalia, they beat drums, blew whistles and chanted. The smell of incense filled the air as the traditional healers wailed and begged the ancestors for a free and fair election. They later headed to a stream near Cassandra Park, where further rituals were performed and the goat was slaughtered. The forum’s treasurer, gogo Nkanyezi Matlhako, said she was confident the election would be without drama. “Our forebears are happy. I felt positive energy when I was busy communicating with the ancestors,” she said. “We are Africans and whenever a big event like this happens, we should ask for help from our forefathers. I want to thank the healers who participated in this ceremony because they love their country. They did not benefit financially from this ceremony.”
