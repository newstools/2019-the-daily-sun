AFTER four months of patiently waiting for their new home, the Baloyi family’s long wait will soon be over. The City of Joburg has arranged all the documents and the construction of the house will start soon. Incredible Happenings prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng told Daily Sun he was happy the city had finally approved plans for the house in Orlando East, Soweto. “I received the news on Wednesday. It took lots of back and forth, protests and constantly having to send my team to check on the progress. “I’m relieved it’s all systems go in terms of the plans,” he said. Mboro said a project manager told him he would visit the family to give them a breakdown on rebuilding the house. “I’ll get feedback from him and we’ll proceed as soon as possible,” said the pastor. “I’m hoping to get this done soon so the family has a decent roof over their heads.” Gogo Elizabeth Baloyi (62) previously said she was unhappy with the delays, but now she is glad progress has been made. “I’m relieved the project will be starting soon,” she said. In January, the SunTeam visited the Baloyis, who were living in a house with broken kitchen walls for three years after heavy rain storms. The family explained the pain of having to cook and eat in full view of the public. They hoped things would change for the better when Pastor Mboro swore not only to fix their kitchen, but also to demolish the entire structure and build a new house.
