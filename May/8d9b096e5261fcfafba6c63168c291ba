THE dead must be respected and graves should always be cleaned. But the condition of the cemetery in Thornhill, Eastern Cape, will make the dead turn in their graves. Residents told Daily Sun their pleas to the Kouga Municipality have been falling on deaf ears. Nontutukelo Klaas (65) said her aunt was buried in the graveyard two years ago, but the family has been struggling to find the grave. “The cemetery is covered with long grass and shrubs. Sometimes cattle graze in it, trampling graves and knocking down tombstones.” Resident Rosemary Bloem (36) said: “The municipality should be held accountable for failing to maintain the graveyard. They are violating the rights of the dead.” Municipal spokeswoman Laura Leigh-Randall said R500 000 was budgeted for the fencing and maintenance of all 15 cemeteries, including Thornhill. She said a three-year contract was awarded to a building company, but the project is being disputed in court as one of the bidders lodged an objection. “An arbitration hearing was on 28 March and we await the outcome.”
