A FORMER hospital worker is crying out for help after healers and what she believes are evil spirits robbed her of her money. Margaret Cola from Govan Mbeki kasi in Missionvale, Port Elizabeth, is penniless. Margaret (60) was milked of all her pension money when she consulted prophets, after working at Greenacres Hospital for 27 years as a baker. “But since 2014 a defiant small black bird, maggots, frogs, a snake, a swarm of bees, baboons and rats invaded my house.” She started fighting with her husband. “We accused each other of theft. He started drinking and became abusive. I had a fight at work and quit my job.” She received more than R500 000 from her pension fund. They spent a lot of money on healers but the problems didn’t go away. A foreigner who claimed he was a sangoma promised he’d double her money and she gave him R150 000. But he disappeared. In 2017 she spent her last R2 800 on the 17th sangoma, but it didn’t help. “I appeal to Good Samaritans who have the powers to cleanse my house and save my marriage,” she said. Her husband Crosby (60) said the baboon kept dancing on the roof. “A week doesn’t end without a fight. We tried everything with the money we had to save our marriage,” he said. Sangoma Nomathongo Mkhokheli said: “The snake changes itself into different creatures, so there are always fights.”
