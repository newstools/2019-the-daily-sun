PHILEMON Shongwane said after 30 years of pain, the black cloud that followed his family has finally left. The Shongwanes from Vaalbank, Mpumalanga, have suffered from bad luck since they found a black cat in their yard and killed it. Philemon (54) told Daily Sun last month that family members had been dying and experiencing bad luck since the incident. But after the People’s Paper published their story, the family received help. “Thank you, Daily Sun, for helping us. We finally have peace,” said Philemon. “We are grateful to sangoma Jacob Babu for cleansing our home. We’ve suffered a lot. “We even abandoned our home because there were evil spirits in the yard.” Philemon said after the yard was cleansed, luck returned to their home. Three family members found work after being jobless for a long time. “Now I can sleep peacefully and have no more bad dreams. My neighbours never greeted us, but now we talk and share jokes.” Philemon said his mum, Tryphine (72), didn’t really talk to him and used a stick to walk. “But now I have a good relationship with my mum and she’s able to walk without using a stick now,” said Philemon.
