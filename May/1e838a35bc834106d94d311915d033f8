TWO former cash-in-transit security guards were sentenced to nine years in prison. The Makhado Magistrates Court in Limpopo on Monday sentenced Tinyiko Maluleke (41) and Rofhiwa Luvhimbi (31) for stealing R2,9 million. They collected money from various businesses, but kept it for themselves instead of depositing it. They were reported by their manager after failing to account for large amounts of money. Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said the pair stole the money in December and in January. Maluleke said the money was recovered when police arrested the two separately in Ravele Riverside and in Waterval, Elim. “The investigating team searched three different locations during an overnight operation and found banknotes buried in their yards. “Some of the money was stashed in ice cream containers and refuse bags. One of them had already bought a car and building materials, which were confiscated.”
