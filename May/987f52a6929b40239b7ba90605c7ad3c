BANYANA Banyana old-horse Noko Matlou has been in the game for over a decade now. But the Banyana stalwart says going to the Fifa Women’s World Cup will be the highlight of her football career after being included in coach Desiree Ellis’ final squad. The team will leave for France tomorrow afternoon. The 33-year-old Moletjie-born star‚ who in 2009 became the first South African footballer to receive the Caf Women’s Player of the Year award‚ has played in all competitions that Banyana have been part of in the past 11 years. That includes two Olympic Games in London in 2012 and Brazil in 2016. She has also been involved in six Africa Women Cup of Nations, and participated in Cosafa Cup on numerous occasions. “This is the moment,” Matlou told SunSport. “I have been waiting my whole life to play in the World Cup.” Qualifying for this year’s World Cup, finishing second at the Women’s Afcon, which was held in Ghana last year was emotional for Matlou as she was part of the team that narrowly missed going to the 2015 edition in Canada. She recalled: “If you remember very well, when we lost to Ivory Coast in the third and fourth place play-offs, we were all heartbroken. “But quitting football never crossed my mind. I’ve had the believe that one day my dream of playing in the World Cup would come true.” She said when they went to Ghana last year, their goal as players was to ensure they qualify, “considering my age I also knew that if we fail, my World Cup dream won’t come true”. She will marshal Banyana’s defence with the experienced 32-year-old captain Janine Van Wyk, who is also one of the senior players in the team. In their maiden World Cup, Banyana are paired in Group B with Spain, Germany and China. Banyana are four of the newcomers at the World Cup along with Chile, Jamaica and Scotland.
