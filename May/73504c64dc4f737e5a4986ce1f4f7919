MZANSI’s biggest and boldest travelling wine show, the TOPS at SPAR Wine Show, returns to Cape Town. Best locally produced wines will be on display from 11 to 13 July at the GrandWest Casino. Andrew Douglas, owner and producer of The Wine Show, said this was the show’s third return to the Mother City. “This year’s show at GrandWest promises to deliver an amazing line-up of well-known and as-yet-undiscovered gems from the world-renowned Cape winelands for tasting and buying, entertainment at every turn. “There will be interactive edutainment in our popular wine theatres, as well as many other crowd-pleasing attractions, including the Search for a Super Taster in the South African Wine Tasting Championships, Wine Label Design Awards – presented by Rotolabel. “The opportunity to learn about the untold value of wines produced from old vines from the Old Vine Project, a chance to win wine for a year with the Stellenbosch Vineyards and experience VIP food pairing with the SA Sommeliers Association, and more,” Andrew said. GrandWest’s Sun Exhibits will once again be transformed into a space for wine lovers to indulge themselves. “The show is always fun and offers something for every wine lover, from novice to aficionado,” he said. “It’s a place to stock up on old favourites and make new discoveries, which can be shipped free of charge with our complimentary ‘Sip ‘n Ship’ service.” After Cape Town, the SPAR Wine Show travels to Port Elizabeth from 25 to 27 July, Pretoria from 3 to 5 October, East London from 7 to 9 November, rounding off in Nelspruit from 28 to 30 November.
