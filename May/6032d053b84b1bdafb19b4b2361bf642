RESIDENTS of Brazzaville near Saulsville told Daily Sun they fear for their lives. This is because a damaged transformer in the Tshwane kasi has been making sparks at night. Residents said the problem has cost them their radios, TVs and fridges. Selina Bothotha (53) from Vergenoeg squatter camp told the SunTeam the transformer has had problems since 2017. “We’re living in fear as the transformer keeps making a loud popping noise, and flames cause a huge cloud of smoke,” said Selina. She said the problem was caused by overloading as residents of a nearby squatter camp had made izinyoka connection. “We’ve been living in the area for 20 years, and this is what we get,” she said. She said residents couldn’t take the stress anymore and wanted the municipality to take action. “We report the transformer to the municipality every week, but they fail to provide a permanent solution. We’re tired and scared someone will die from this one day.” Councillor Betty Ringani told Daily Sun she was aware of the problem, and that the municipality had installed three new transformers. But these were also causing problems. “We have a problem with land invasion and a lot of lawlessness in the area,” she said. Ringani said the municipality was repairing the broken transformers. “We want to draw up a petition asking for an extra transformer.” The councillor said she was scared to approach people who made illegal connections because they might attack and kill her.
