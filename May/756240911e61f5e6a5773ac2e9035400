JUSTICE Chabalala’s future with Soweto giants Orlando Pirates looks uncertain. The central defender never played a single game this past season under coach Milutin Sredojevic. He struggled to get the nod ahead of regulars Happy Jele, Alfred Ndengane and Nyasha Munetsi. However, his agent Ratshibvumo Mulovhedzi says they will soon have a meeting with Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza to sort out his future. Chabalala and left-back Thabo Matlaba who also struggled for game time could join a list of fringe players that will be released ahead of the new season. Said Mulovhedzi: “Justice’s contract will expire in June, but Pirates have a two-year option to extend and we are waiting for them to tell us the way forward.” Mulovhedzi revealed that he discussed lack of game time issue with the 27-year-old defender who was also loaned out to Chippa United in Ferbuary, 2017. “There is nothing wrong with Justice not getting game time. The team has been doing well and the coach cannot change the winning combination. Nobody has been guaranteed a place in the starting line-up and he will need to work extra hard next season in order to get a chance to play if Pirates decide to keep him.” Mulovhedzi told SunSport that there are teams that are interested in his services including Bucs rivals Kaizer Chiefs and Cape Town City. I have interest from three PSL teams in Gauteng, another one in Durban and two in Limpopo province. But out first option is Pirates and we want to focus there. His father and mother are Pirates fans, so he is a Buccaneer for life unless they decide otherwise.”
