A MAN was arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping a four-year-old. The suspect (22) apparently went to the victim’s home in Mhlanga, Willowvale, in the afternoon to ask her gogo for mealies. Police spokesman Jackson Manatha said after getting the mealies, the suspect went to braai them in a shack on the same property. The child followed him. Manatha said the gogo later found the child naked in the shack and the suspect half-naked. The child’s gogo raised the alarm and community members rushed to the scene. “The suspect tried to flee, but he was chased and caught. He was handed over to the Willowvale cops and charged with rape. “He will appear in the Willowvale Magistrates Court on a rape charge.” Butterworth commander Brigadier Ngangema Xakavu congratulated residents for helping make sure police could take the suspect into custody. He said it was better than taking the law into their own hands.
