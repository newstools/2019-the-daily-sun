BULLYING, drugs and teenage pregnancy are top on the police’s to-do list. Last Wednesday Tshwane Metro cops, the Akasia police social crime prevention unit and the CPF visited Soshanguve South High School in Tshwane. They talked about bullying, drug and alcohol abuse, as well as teenage pregnancy. Constable Tumisang Moloto said the team was on a mission to teach pupils about these isues. “The visit is part of the safer schools programme, which aims to ensure the safety of pupils.” Moloto said the team held a roadblock along the R566 near Roslyn and issued 250 pamphlets with safety tips. “Pupils and teachers welcomed the visit by police. “They said it made them feel safe knowing there was police visibility at the school.” The cops encouraged pupils to visit their local police station to learn how the copy could help them.
