Their loss in the Nedbank Cup final hasn’t made things any better, but a video of Chiefs manager Bobby Motaung praising TS Galaxy for their victory has made angry fans attack him on social media.

Why can’t he step aside?” Zeh Zwane said: “He looks drunk, which means he’s happy with the performance of his team.” Mlindi Mjoli said: “He’s drunk and we know drunk people speak the truth.” Kaizer Chiefs spokesman Vina Maphosa told Daily Sun he couldn’t comment as the team hasn’t been together since coming back from Durban.
