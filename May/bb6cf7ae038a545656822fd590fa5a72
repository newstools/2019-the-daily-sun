EVERYTHING came to a standstill. Residents blocked entrances to the area, demanding service delivery. Pupils were forced to go back home as schools were also closed. Residents of Emaphephethweni in Inanda, north of Durban, claim their taps have been running dry for more than five years. They said phase one of an RDP project was completed a few years ago and some people who had registered never moved in. Sifiso Ntombela (32) said residents were tired of empty promises and wanted answers from the councillor. Another resident, Sipho Gwala (38), said all they wanted was service delivery. What irritated them the most was that the councillor was nowhere to be found. “We want houses and water,” he said. KZN education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa condemned the disruption of teaching and learning. “We appeal to residents not to disturb teaching and learning during service delivery protests,” said Mthethwa. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the protest was illegal. Inkosi Thandizwe Gwala told residents Councillor Maxwell Mkhize was aware of what was happening. “Phase one of the RDP housing project was handed over last year,” said Gwala. “I asked him why the houses were not given to the owners, and he said he was still waiting for government to tell him how to allocate the houses.” Mkhize said he was aware there was unrest but couldn’t attend to it because he was stuck in meetings the whole day. He said the water issue has been there since 2013. “This is because the water plant that supplies the area is being renovated,” said Mkhize. “As for RDPs, the inkosi and committee members have to identify people who should benefit.”
