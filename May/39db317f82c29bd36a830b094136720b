PUPILS at Efata School for the Deaf and Blind in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, will no longer have to queue at public clinics for hearing tests. Yesterday Education Minister Angie Motshekga unveiled an audio clinic on behalf of the Road Accident Fund. Principal Yolande Mtwa said the school will have proper audiology for pupils. “When pupils come to school, they need to be assessed to see if they’re hard of hearing or profoundly deaf. “When they’ve to write exams, we have to apply for special consent to be given reasonable time. “The department has just hired an audiology specialist. This is going to help us,” she said. Mtwa said the school was operating on rented premises and urged the minister to build a new school. Speaking through an interpreter, grade 12 pupil Mthabiseng Mlungisi (21) said: “I’m happy I’ll no longer stand in queues at public clinics and hospitals the whole day.” Noluthando Mvabaza, the fund’s national corporate social responsibility manager, said the clinic cost R500 000.
