Tumi Molekane AKA Stogie T says he won't be featuring in anyone's song anymore he would still invite other artists to feature on his songs but they would know from the onset that he won't be returning the favour. Taking to Twitter yesterday the star explained that he is proud of all the features he has done and have been some truly iconic ones but he is now closed for collaborations. "Stogie T is officially closed for collaborations. Got one more song I am featured on and that's the end for being on other people's albums" he tweeted. Stogie also explained that he was proud of all features he had done since he started his career but  he is now focusing elsewhere. "It's not the end of collaborations with artists if I invite them but I am just not jumping on your project that's all. It's the difference between getting booked and doing your own productions."
