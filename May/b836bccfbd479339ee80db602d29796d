IF WE ever see him again at school, we will drag him out of the premises and shut it down. These were the words of angry parents from Bhekamatshe Primary School in eTafuleni, Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands. Their protest disrupted lessons on Tuesday. Yesterday, the principal was not seen at school but everything seemed to be normal. The parents claimed the principal was not doing his job and ensuring a helpful learning environment for their kids. They said the toilets were not safe, their kids were given tasks that had nothing to do with learning and that they were not given an opportunity to sell food in the school grounds. One of the parents, Nonhlanhla Mbatha (33), said: “The toilets have big holes in the floor and our kids could fall into the pit anytime.” She said they tried to address their concerns with the principal at the beginning of last year and he allegedly told them that he has reported the matter to the department. “We requested another meeting once again to find out about developments. His response was that the school didn’t have the budget to build new toilets.” She said this made them realise that the principal did not care about the safety of their kids. Another parent, Nondumiso Zondi (34), said they were unhappy that their kids were given cleaning duties and had to open the school gate. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they were aware of the matter. “We urge the parents to leave the matter to the department. Once a matter is reported, the department that has to work it out, not the other way around. “They should also remember that only the head of department has the right to fire a principal or close a school,” said Mahlambi.
