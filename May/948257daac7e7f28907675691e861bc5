NATIONAL police commissioner General Khehla Sitole visited Vuwani yesterday to check whether cops were ready for tomorrow’s election. His visit to the Limpopo town came after cops shot rubber bullets at protesting residents last week. They had gathered at a stadium to discuss plans to boycott the election. He was with his deputy, Lieutenant-General Fannie Masemola and provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba. Residents said they were standing firm in their demand that villages placed under the Collins Chabane Municipality three years ago should be returned to Makhado Municipality. In 2015 and 2016, there were also protests over the issue. Public order cops were yesterday sent to the village to oversee the special voting process. “We have sent 51 000 police officers to protect people on voting day. In Limpopo, we have 1 500 police working on the ground.” Jeffrey Rafzilani of the IEC said they had 34 voting stations in the Vuwani area and 628 people had registered for special voting.
