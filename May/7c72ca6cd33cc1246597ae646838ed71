THERE was chaos at the Walter Sisulu University’s Nelson Mandela Drive campus yesterday. Private security guards clashed with students and staff. SRC publicity officer Asanda Mtshezi said the fight broke out after armed guards demanded a phone from a staff member, accusing him of taking a video of them. Mtshezi said students retaliated after a student was manhandled. “They accused any student on campus carrying their phones of taking videos of them,” she said. She said students fought back and attacked the security guards. The guards fired rubber bullets at the students. “We want these security guards off our campus. They must go.” The campus went on a two week class boycott over NSFAS allowances. Mtshezi said the situation was tense.
