A School in the Vaal celebrated its 27 sets of twins on Friday. Sicelo Primary School principal Johannes Maloka said they loved having so many twins. But teaching twins in the same classroom could be a problem. “You ask one a question and the other one answers, especially when they’re in trouble – and you can’t tell them apart,” said Maloka. He said it was a unique experience in their school. “Today is a special celebration. Since the school opened in 2001, this has not happened before,” he said. “We’ve always had at least three sets, but this is a blessing. This is a very special event for the school.” The twins received gifts from various organisations and people. The Midvaal Traffic and Fire Department joined in the celebration. Teacher Seipati Mabula, head of department and event planner at the school, said: “We had to make these pupils feel special as some of them are vulnerable and don’t often get celebrated.” One of the pupils said: “I lost my twin, so today it’s special to be celebrated with the other twins. “The event brings heartache but it means a lot to me to be appreciated like this,” she said.
