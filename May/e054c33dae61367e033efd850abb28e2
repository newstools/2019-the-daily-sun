The campaigning period is over. And now political parties must do the honorable thing...remove posters from poles across the country. The Economic Freedom Fighters is congratulating its members for showing leadership. They have started taking down elections posters. IT is usually a struggle to get parties to take down political party posters from poles after the elections. EFF tweeted pictures of its 'fighters in Buffalo City Municipality showing leadership'. "We are taking down posters Fighters," said the tweet.
