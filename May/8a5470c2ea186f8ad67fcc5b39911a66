FURIOUS residents yesterday demanded to speak to their provincial commissioner. Protesters from Klipsruit, Soweto gathered outside Moroka Police Station, saying cops were not fighting crime in the area. They barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks, saying they wanted to talk to Gauteng commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela. Zizipho Mabandla (30) said they were sick of being failed by the cops. “We are experiencing a high level of crime and gangs are terrorising our kasi. “Crimes such as hijacking and murder are being committed,” she said. Ntombifuthi Shange (42) said they believed the only person who could solve their problems was the commissioner. “All we want is for the cops to take us seriously and listen to our grievances. We are really tired. If the commissioner doesn’t come here, we will shut down the whole of Soweto,” she said. Amos Selepe (29) said he was hijacked and had to trace his car himself. “I found my Ford Focus at the local hostel. When I reported the matter to police, they said they were scared to go to the hostel.” Police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said no one was arrested. “The residents handed over a memorandum to our station commander, who promised to increase visibility in the area.”
