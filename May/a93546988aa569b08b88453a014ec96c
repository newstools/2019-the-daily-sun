MARITZBURG United have successfully retained their Absa Premiership status for the 2019/20 season after registering their third victory in the relegation / promotion play-offs. The Team of Choice registered their third straight victory in the promotion/relegation play-offs, beating National First Division (NFD) runner’s up side Royal Eagles 2-0 at Chatsworth Stadium. Siphesihle Ndlovu and Thabiso Kutumela ensured that Team of Choice stays in the elite league with their goals in each half of the match.Ndlovu who won the PSL in 2017/18 campaign did not have a good season at all, however, his goal against Eagles reminded football fanatics of the quality he has. It was only his second goal of the campaign and it was no doubt the most important. Eric Tinkler’s charges have not conceded a goal in three play-offs matche. They are now going to host Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in their last play-off dead rubber match at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday, (3pm). It was a tough season for Maritzburg, but now they can take break and start planning to ensure that they do not go through another stressful campaign fighting relegation.
