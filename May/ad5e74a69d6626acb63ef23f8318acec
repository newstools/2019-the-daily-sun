ZIMASEKA Njova (20) from Cabekwana Village in Lusikisiki dropped out of school because she doesn’t have an ID. “I can’t do anything without an ID, which is why I quit school. I knew I wouldn’t be allowed to write matric without one.” Zimaseka is struggling to get the document, even though she has a birth certificate and her mother’s ID papers. “I tried to get an ID, but was told by a social worker she wouldn’t help me get one because I still have family members who can assist me.” However, her mother died in 2010 and there was no death certificate. Zimaseka said her problem also affected her seven-month-old child as she can’t get a child grant. The young woman’s aunt, Fikiswa Njova (35) said they didn’t have a death certificate as they struggled to get details from the hospital. “We were tired of going back and forth without getting help so we decided to bury her without the death certificate,” said Fikiswa. Home Affairs provincial manager Gcinile Mabulu said: “We will be able to help the young lady, but we will need documents like a letter from her primary school and chief or councillor. “We will have to check if she was born in a hospital or if a midwife helped with her birth. We will then have to search for the midwife.”
