AMENISTO narrowly escaped death on Saturday. The DJ and producer was hijacked in Manguzi, KZN. He was robbed at gunpoint of his Ford Ranger, cellphones, iPads, IDs and a sound system worth over R200 000. The DJ whose real name is Nqobani Gumede, (33), said he was hired by a man who identified himself as Mr Tembe to perform at a tavern in an area. He said he didn’t suspect anything was wrong because Mr Tembe paid a deposit into his bank account. “I’m still shaking because these people planned this thing. I was with my friends Siyabonga Mkhwanazi and Blessing “Dogg” Khumalo when it happened,” he said. “When we arrived in Manguzi, Mr Tembe told us he was going to pick up someone in town who would direct us to the venue.” Amenisto said the guy got into the car and kept on receiving calls. “There was something off and I had a feeling we were going to be robbed. I even made a joke about it,” he said. “Mr Tembe asked us to stop for two other guys he works with and that’s when all hell broke loose.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of hijacking was opened.
