VERY few cars have taken the market by storm like the new Suzuki Jimny! It offers loads of quirky charm and its retro, rugged design grabs the attention unlike anything in its segment. SunWheels tested the range-topping GLX model and we almost didn’t hand back the keys! Though the Jimny is a niche player, Suzuki is flooded with orders! Its sharp styling, Suzuki’s reputation for offering reliable products and its keen pricing has made it an instant hit in the market. Most buyers of the Jimny will probably use it as their everyday wheels and never go off-road. The Jimny is powered by a 1,5-litre four cylinder unit that delivers 75 kW at 6 000 r/min and 130 Nm at 4 000 r/min, while the four-speed automatic transmission feels more refined than expected. Overall the everyday driving quality has improved significantly when compared to its predecessor but the ride isn’t quite as smooth as some more conventional crossovers.
