MADALA Fredie Blom is 115 but he can still chop wood and walk properly. Fredie from Delft, Cape Town, turned 115 on 8 May. He told Daily Sun he was born in 1904 in Adelaide, Eastern Cape. “I feel like a baby. I’m always happy and I enjoy my life. I don’t worry about many things,” said Fredie. Madala Fredie said he used to work on various farms around the Western Cap. “I used to buy clothes and food with a penny, and it was enough. “But today you need a lot of money just to buy a sheep head,” he said. Fredie said he met his wife Jeanette (86) many years ago when he was a dancer. Jeanette told the People’s Paper: “Fredie was one of the best dancers in the area. “That’s why I fell in love with him. Even though many women liked him, I’m glad he chose me and we’re still together.” She said when Fredie asked her to be his wife, her family was not happy. “My brother chased him away but I told him I was the one who was in love with Fredie,” said Jeanette. “Today my brother and sister enjoy his company.” Fredie and Jeanette never had children.
