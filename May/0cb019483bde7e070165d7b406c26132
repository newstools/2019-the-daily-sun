MZANSI people believe Advocate Thuli Madonsela would make a great deputy president. South Africans all over social media are suggesting Madonsela's name for deputy president. This is after deputy president David DD Mabuza requested a postponement of his swearing-in on Wednesday. Since then, people have been coming up with names of people they think should occupy his position. The likes of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Naledi Pandor have been suggested but today, Madonsela is a 'leading candidate'. Mzansi people love Madonsela for the good work she did during her time as public protector.
