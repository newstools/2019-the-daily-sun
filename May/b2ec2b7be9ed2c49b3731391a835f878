 Rapper Senzo 'Kwesta'
Vilakazi on Thursday launched his new track titled Khethile Khethile. The event took place at the Flames Restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel, in Westcliff Johannesburg.   The song talks about
Kwesta journey to choosing Yolanda Mvelase (now Yolanda Vilakazi) as the love
of his life. "I was inspired. I knew what the next step of my life was. I
knew what I wanted to do and I wanted to capture that in the studio," Kwesta
said.  Kwesta said that he
knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Yolanda. "I knew
that I was getting into a family and a family was getting into mine. I was
uniting families. I knew I was embracing the romance that I have with this
lovely woman. And that's what I wanted to capture in the song," he said.  The rapper said that
it was important that the song doesn't lose what people associate him to.
"It sounds genuinely South African... And the story is genuinely me and
Yo" Kwesta said. The music video is a
compilation of shots from Kwesta's wedding with Yolanda. The couple got married
in March. Kwesta said that they didn't plan to shoot the song's video during
the wedding. He said that the song wasn't finished yet when the wedding
happened. According to the
rapper, someone from his team was shooting clips from the wedding and when he
saw the clips. He decided they needed to go with the song. Kwesta said that his
music going forward will be authentic. He said that people should not expect
the music to sound like 'Khethile Khethile". "Expect the music
to capture what I am going through very truthfully and honestly. "As an
artist, I am tired of selling a facade of something. It's never gonna be a
facade if you hear it from me from now on," he said.  The song will be
available on all music streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Joox and
Deezer tomorrow.
