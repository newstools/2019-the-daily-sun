RESIDENTS of villages near Weenen, in the KZN Midlands, have urged Police Minister Bheki Cele to stop the killing in their area. They told Daily Sun more than 20 people have been gunned down, apparently because of feuds rocking the KwaMadondo and eNhlawe villages since 2016. The most recent incident took place on Tuesday in KwaMadondo, when Makhosazana Nzimande (33) and daughter Nomvula Mbatha (15) were shot dead. Makhosazana’s three other kids aged 6, 8 and 10, who survived the shooting, are in hospital. Makhosazana’s brother-in-law, Mvuseli Mbatha (43), said her death was not the first incident in their family. On 9 May his older brother Zamokwakhe Mbatha (51) escaped death after being shot by unknown thugs. “We’re now calling on Cele to intervene because the killings are getting worse. “The police, traditional leaders and government are aware of these killings yet we don’t see any action. We are not seeing any arrests.” said Mvuseli. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. “Charges of murder and attempted murder were opened for investigation at Weenen cop shop,” said Zwane. Cele’s spokeswoman Reneilwe Serero said: “The minister can intervene but the concerned residents need to call his office or his direct number and request his direct intervention.”
