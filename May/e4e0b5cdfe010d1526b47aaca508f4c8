It’s been 25 years since South Africa gained freedom. To this day, it has been a one horse race when it comes to our political parties. The ANC has made many blunders over the years but opposition parties such as the DA, EFF, Cope and UDM fail to capitalise on the ANC’s mistakes. They point fingers at the ruling party’s failures. Opposition parties, showing your rival their shortcomings will cause you more harm than good. Build only one RDP house where the ANC failed to build 100. Fix potholes where the ruling party couldn’t tar the entire road. Build one school and ensure that there are proper toilets for our kids. The people will realise that if the opposition parties are given a chance, a lot could improve. Opposition parties should know that blaming the ANC only exposes their own vulnerability. They should note that it’s not only about filling up the stadiums or how many food parcels you donate when campaigning, but about how many lives you touch with your actions. Letter from William Mawete in Bochum.
