ORLANDO Pirates threw away two crucial points which were going to see them stretch the gap between them and second placed Mamelodi Sundowns to three points at the top of the Absa Premiership table. The Buccaneers were held to a thrilling 2-2 draw by Cape Town City at Athlone Stadium yesterday. City took the lead after just 20 seconds through Zukile Kewuti. Thembinkosi Lorch equalised before Luvuyo Memela increased Bucs’ lead. With six minutes remaining, Craig Martin headed home to level matters. Last year, Pirates were denied the league title by the same City who defeated them 1-0 in Cape Town in the penultimate match. On Tuesday, Sundowns could go top of the table if they get maximum points against Golden Arrows at Loftus Stadium. The result means that Pirates will remain at the top of the table with 54 points after 29 matches, one point ahead of Sundowns who are on 53 points with a match in hand. Yesterday’s other results assured that the 2018-19 season title race and relegation battle will be decided on the final day of the season on Saturday. At the bottom half, Maritzburg United shocked many when they thumped SuperSport United 3-1 at Harry Gwala Stadium. Mohau Mokate’s first half goal and Judas Moseamedi brace in the second half saw the Team of Choice registering their sixth victory of the season, keeping their hopes of surviving the dreaded axe alive. Yesterday’s other results: AmaZulu 1 – 1 Black Leopards; Polokwane City 1 – 3 Chippa United; Bidvest Wits 3 – 1 Baroka FC; Highlands Park 1 – 0 Bloem Celtic; Kaizer 1 – 1 Free State Stars.
