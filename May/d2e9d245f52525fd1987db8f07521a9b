ANOTHER ANC Youth League leader has been murdered. Dumisani Moyo (35) from Ntshongweni, south of Cato Ridge in KZN, was gunned down outside his home on Tuesday. Moyo was league chairman in ward 7. League provincial secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo said: “Moyo dedicated his entire life to young people’s freedom. “This brutal assassination is an assault on the future of our movement.” He sent his condolences to Moyo’s family, his children and the community. He called on cops to investigate the assassination. “We urge members of the league to exercise self-discipline and to allow police to do their work. We must stand up for the truth in the same way that Moyo did,” said Sabelo. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was being investigated. She said Moyo was shot by two unknown suspects. “He sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body and later died at a clinic,” she said. Moyo’s brother Themba (44), a former councillor, said there were tensions in the area.
