Poet, Ntsiki Mazwai is known for her outspoken tweets, however this weekend she went off on the wrong person! It all started from Khanya Mkangisa trending on tweeter, when Ntsiki saw the opportunity of calling her “obnoxious” comparing her to Pearl Thusi. “Khanya has that obnoxious thing that Pearl Thusi has....” Mama Pantha did not take this laying, she then dragged Ntsiki, saying “Guys please watch ntsiki's show. Its sad when someone can't love themselves enough to leave other women alone. But if we support her then maybe she'll value herself enough to stop trying to insult and drag other women down" Pearl even asked her followers to tweet "I love Ntsiki", calling her Comrade Judge Ntsiki!  Don’t come for Pearl!
