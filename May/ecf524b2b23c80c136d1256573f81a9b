ALEXANDRA police have arrested a fed-up girlfriend who stabbed her boyfriend to death. The 32-year-old woman was apparently gatvol with the boyfriend’s tendency of disappearing on payday, only to return home after a few days. According to police, the 28-year-old man was stabbed and died on his way to the clinic. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Malatji said the trouble apparently was sparked by suspicion of cheating. “The dead man apparently had a habit of sleeping out every time on payday, and he’d show up a few days later.” The arrested girlfriend has a two-month-old baby. The suspect was arrested and charged with murder. “The infant was taken in by the granny,” Malatji told Daily Sun. “The suspect will soon appear in the Wynberg Magistrates Court for a bail application.”
