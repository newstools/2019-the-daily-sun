SA Football Association (Safa) president, Danny Jordaan, has reassured South African fans that it will be safe at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt. This after a bus that was carrying 28 South Africans among its passengers, was attacked in Cairo on Sunday. Although there were no reports of deaths, the explosion reportedly injured 17 passengers among them three South African tourists. The incident has called into question the safety of fans hoping to travel to Egypt for the upcoming Afcon tournament set to kick-off on 21 June. However, Jordaan believes the Egyptian government will ensure that the tournament goes on without any such incidents and has reassured fans that it will be safe to travel to the North African country. “This is a matter for the Egyptian government to deal with and they have been in communication with our government and so we believe they have the capacity to deal with this problem and to provide a safe environment for Afcon,” said Jordaan. “But we will be updated as things move along from our own government that will surely brief us, but so far we are all systems go the Afcon in Egypt." Cameroon were the initial hosts, but due to delays in the delivery of infrastructure, they were stripped of the rights to host the tournament. Egypt was chosen by the CAF Executive Committee as the host nation of the competition ahead of South Africa who were hoping to step in for Cameroon. Nonetheless, Jordaan has full confidence in the Egyptians’ ability to host a successful tournament. “I’m convinced that as the Vice president of the organising committee of the Afcon that we will be fully briefed and given the assurance that the tournament will go on without any further incident.”
