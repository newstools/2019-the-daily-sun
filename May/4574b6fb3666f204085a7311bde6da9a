Social media personality and make-up artist Mihlali Ndamase claims that she and her friends were subjected to racism and were called "animals" by FlySafair staff members for being "too loud". Taking to Instagram to share their alleged encounter in a lengthy post, Ndamase said the airline needs to hire staff members who are "educated" and "trained". "My friends and I were called animals by these people on @flysafairza because we were being too loud on a flight. I didn't know it was against the law to speak on a flight, I mean if you have a problem with hearing black people's voices buy a private jet." In a statement released by the airline on Monday afternoon, the company said they were still in talks with Ndamase and would give no further comment until the matter had been resolved between both parties. The incident has since been trending, one of the tweeps who claimed to have been on the same flight as Ndamase and her friends gave a different version than Ndamase's. My friends and I were called animals by these people on @flysafairza because we were being “loud” on the flight. I didn’t know it was against the law to speak on a flight, I mean if you have an issue with hearing black people’s voices buy a private jet ????‍?? I can’t believe we have to deal with such treatment in 2019 for being black, I’m so disappointed. Please hire EDUCATED, TRAINED staff. I can’t spend my money on a flight only to be treated like someone who’s not supposed to be on the airline, because of the colour of my skin. They called policemen to escort us off the flight, because we questioned what the issue was with our behavior and funny enough the police men saw absolutely NOTHING wrong with our behavior. I tried to handle this matter with as much grace and maturity as possible but I’m outraged by how much disrespect we got from the staff of FLYSAFAIR @flysafairza A post shared by  Mihlali Ndamase (@mihlalii_n) on May 12, 2019 at 11:39am PDT
