People were surprised to see a big plane on the N1 highway in Polokwane on Thursday. And soon, rumours started spreading around the Limpopo town like wild fire. They said the plane landed on the highway because the pilot wanted to buy some lunch. ButÂ Matome Taueatsoala-Moremi, the spokesman for Limpopo Transport Department said it was all a lie. Rumours that a pilot landed a plane on the N1 highway near Mall of the North to buy lunch, is not true. Taueatsoala-Moremi said the airplane was being Transported to Hoedspruit in an Abnormal Load Truck.  "The speculation that the airplane landed in the middle of the road for a meal is not true. "The Denel airplane, used for a hotel development in Hoedspruit, was being transported via Polokwane because there is a bridge on the route through Belfast and Lydenburg that could not accommodate the dimensions of the airplane." "I am aware of the stir caused by the video on social media of the pilot who landed, but it's not true," he said. Taueatsoala-Moremi added that people must stop spreading false information because at the end of the day it causes unnecessary tension. "It's not possible that such a big plane can just land just anywhere."
