 An aspiring
English teacher who murdered his friend’s mother he claimed had come on to him,
should have had the foresight that beating her with a glass vase could result
in her death. This was
the judgment of Judge Derek Wille, who convicted Reghard Groenewald of
murdering Hilary van Rooyen, 52, inside her Durbanville home two years ago. Her son had
found her dead body in May 2017 after he had gone to check on her when her
house keys, which Groenewald had taken and discarded, were picked up and handed
in at a local primary school. Only her cellphone had been missing from the
house. Groenewald
said he had visited Van Rooyen on May 8, 2017 - the day before she was killed –
because he wanted to say goodbye ahead of leaving the country to teach English
abroad. At a
farewell party held for Van Rooyen’s younger son – the accused’s high school
friend - before he went to the UK, Groenewald said he and his then girlfriend
told Van Rooyen about their plans and she asked him to come and greet her
before he left the country. He drove
about 100m to 150m before he ran out of petrol and he returned to Van Rooyen's
house to borrow R100. She gave
him the money and he promised to return it the next day. Groenewald
had testified that on the day of the murder, Van Rooyen made advances on him
and an argument ensued when he rejected her. He pushed
her and she fell, he admitted, and she held onto his pants and threatened to
tell everyone he had tried to rape her. He then assaulted her. Groenewald
claimed a vase was the nearest object he could grab to "hit the deceased
off me". He took the
house keys and cellphone but got rid of it after fleeing the house. Judge Wille
also convicted Groenewald of theft of Van Rooyen’s R10 000 cellphone. SOURCE:
