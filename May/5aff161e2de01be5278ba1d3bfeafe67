NON-PROFIT organisation Widownia aims to help widows. Based in Sebokeng in the Vaal, it helps them to heal and forgive. They are also given agricultural training sponsored by the municipality. Founder Pastor Modise Tlhapi told Daily Sun he was inspired by his father who took care of him and his brother after their mum died. “My brother and I never felt the absence of our mother. My father took good care of us,” he said. This motivated him to offer a helping hand to others in a similar situation. “I was motivated to share my knowledge with widows to help them heal and empower them with skills so they can run their own businesses. “Culture is often used to violate widows’ constitutional rights. “We have traditional laws that deny them their inheritance and land rights.” Palesa Khunwane (40) told Daily Sun it’s been four months since she lost the father of her children. “The programme has helped fill the void my husband left.” She said after her husband was buried, her in-laws evicted her and took the car. “I was unemployed so I had to go home with my kids. They are receiving counselling after seeing my suffering.” Sheila Ngobeni (46) said the organisation has done a lot for those with limited resources. “We plead with government to offer allowances for widows,” she said.
