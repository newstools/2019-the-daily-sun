“WE are business people. We don’t need your vote but are just giving back to the community.” Those were the words of Inkanyamba Business Forum members from Newlands West, Durban, who decided to dig deep into their pockets and donate to the needy. On Saturday, the forum held a celebration after donating school uniforms to 60 pupils from three local schools. They made the generous donation to pupils from Hillgrove, Castlehill and Paul Sykes primary schools on Friday, saying it was their way of giving back to their community. Chairman Siphiwe Ngcobo told Daily Sun the project was introduced by umbrella business forum Isishingishane, which heads the different areas. “We made donations to 20 pupils at each school. “This was the first initiative by business people from the area to the community. “This is our way of showing appreciation and for our communities to get to know us,” Ngcobo said. Nokwanda Sithole (21), the aunt of Hillgrove Primary pupil Aphiwe Khanyile (12), said he had an old uniform and his mother couldn’t afford to buy him a new one this year. “So we are grateful for what the forum did. We are also grateful that today they invited us to have some nice food and drinks with them.” Meanwhile, the Federation For Radical Economic Transformation reached out to 100 eThekwini residents who were affected by the floods. On Thursday, the federation donated food parcels to flood victims living in a tent after losing their homes.
