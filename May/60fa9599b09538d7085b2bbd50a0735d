BULLYING can happen anywhere, at any time and to anyone. Over the years, it has even led to people taking their own lives. A recent study released by research company Ipsos Global Advisor carried out in 28 countries revealed that online bullying has been increasing globally since 2011. The company found that 54% of people polled in Mzansi had been victims of cyberbullying. For this reason, the NGO, 1 000 Women Trust, recently started an anti-bullying campaign. They have a website where people can get information about how to deal with the problem. A national competition has also been launched where five tablets can be won by contestants who design the best anti-bullying posters for schools. The NGO said: “Cyberbullying occurs when a child or a group of children are intimidated, threatened or even embarrassed by another group of kids with the use of technology, such as social media, for instance.” Statistics reveal that boys who bully others at school were twice as likely to abuse their wives and child bullies usually experienced violence at home. “Tougher laws are needed in when it comes to bullying,” said the organisation. They said pupils who were seen as different were more likely to be bullied. These were often gay pupils, those with learning disabilities, or kids of a different race or religion to their classmates. The NGO said this could have lasting psychological effects and said it was important for schools to provide support to pupils who were bullied. To learn more visit www.bullying.co.za.
