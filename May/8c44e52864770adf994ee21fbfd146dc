PHILILE Mathenjwa never let her skin colour stop her from doing what she wanted to do. Even though she grew up in an area where her albinism put her at risk of death, she refused to hide. The 27-year-old from Manguzi, in northern KZN said having a different skin colour didn’t mean she was worth less than other people. “I don’t understand why people treat us differently. “We have the same brain as other people and the same abilities,” she said. Philile said despite being called names, she is still committed to educating people about albinism. After she completed matric in 2010 she decided to start campaigns to teach people about the skin condition. “I worked with local people to spread the message to protect our brothers and sisters who are at risk of being killed. “People need to know that there’s nothing different about us.” “We have the same blood as everyone else and our body parts are no different. There’s no muthi which needs our body parts.” Philile said there was a lack of education about albinism so she decided to join an art group to spread the message to a wider audience. Last year she started going to schools to perform educational plays. “If I can do what other people are able to do, how can I bedifferent? “The brain is the master of everything. There is no reason to feel sorry for yourself,” she said.
