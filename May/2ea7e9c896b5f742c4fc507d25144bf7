MILUTIN Sredojevic has lavished praise on Thembinkosi Lorch, branding the Orlando Pirates star winger the “best player in the country at the moment”. Lorch is up for major honours at the upcoming awards – nominated for the prestigious Absa Premiership Player of the Season, the Player’s Player of the Season and Midfielder of the Season awards. “He (Lorch) is a lion in a human shape,” enthused the Bucs coach. “Throughout the season, really he has been a role model, led by example and gave his best in each and every match. Sometimes we were wondering where he got the energy with the body he has. I call him the atomic ant.” Lorch was Bucs’ leading scorer 15 goals in all competitions this season, including two in the Caf Champions League, and five assists. “With sincere appreciation to his teammates also, if anything is to be put on the table, he has been our best player this season, and I believe the best players in South Africa at the moment,” Sredojevic added. “I really wish him the best next season.”
