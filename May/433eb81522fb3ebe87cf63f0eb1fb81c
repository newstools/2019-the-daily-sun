SPORTS minister Tokozile Xasa has wished World Cup-bound Banyana Banyana, cricket Proteas and Netball Proteas the best of luck. In a glitzy send-off ceremony in Kempton Park on Saturday, Xasa handed out national flags to the teams and assured them of their nation’s full support. The Proteas fly out to the UK this week for the ICC global showpiece while the ladies will be leaving for France for the Fifa Women’s World Cup. The netball Proteas will be taking part in the 15th World Cup edition in Liverpool in July. The national under 20 side, Amajita, will also be representing the country at the Fifa World Cup kicking off in Poland this weekend. “South Africa is a country of excellence. They should see how proud the nation is of them,” said Xasa. “Their effort and commitment is being recognised by government. The federations have done well to ensure we have teams in the World Cup. We are really behind them.”
