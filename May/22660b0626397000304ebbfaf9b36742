ANGRY students took out their frustrations on the director of financial aid on Tuesday. Lectures at the University of the Free State were disrupted when protesting students attacked the director over NSFAS issues. They claimed their payments had been cancelled and were told to pay from their own pockets. The varsity denied the claims. A video of the attack filmed by a student shows the director being pushed and dragged down a staircase as students chant “give us our money”. A student said: “The scheme promised to pay for our studies and to give us allowances for groceries. “But some of us haven’t been given our money. We want our money.” University spokeswoman Lacea Loader said: “The disruptions seem to be linked to a meeting of the EFF Student Command regarding issues with the scheme. “The demands raised at the meeting and during later talks relate to the immediate payment of scheme allowances by the university.” Loader said the varsity agreed with the SRC earlier this year that allowances would be paid in the first week of each month. Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane said an assault case was opened. No arrests were made.
