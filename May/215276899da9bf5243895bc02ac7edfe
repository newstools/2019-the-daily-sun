WILL there be a hand over of the Absa Premiership trophy to the winning team tomorrow, after the last game of the season? This is the question that everyone is asking since the Premier Soccer League (PSL) has challenged its own Disciplinary Committee (DC) ruling handed to Mamelodi Sundowns and Wayne Arendse. The PSL is arguing that the R250 000 financial ruling imposed on Sundowns for fielding an ineligible Arendse, who is also fined R50 000, was too lenient. The argument is that Sundowns should have been docked three points by awarding Bidvest Wits, who played Downs in the match in question, 3-0 and Arendse banned for two matches. But Downs have warned that they will fight this to the bitter end to defend the judgment as they felt the ruling was fair. PSL Acting CEO Mato Madlala told SunSport yesterday that there’s a “possibility” that the trophy will be handed over to the winning team tomorrow (Saturday), but she doesn’t know what stage of the process from PSL prosecutor Nande Becker is at. Said Madlala: “I don’t want to answer negatively, but we shouldn’t rush this thing. There was a sitting last Thursday and I’m not sure where we stand right now. “Until I get that information from the PSL prosecutor, I can’t say anything right now. But there’s a possibility that the trophy will be given to the winning team. But at this point I don’t know where we are with regards to the process.” Reigning champions Sundowns went to summit of the PSL table on Tuesday after beating Golden Arrows 2-0 at Loftus Versfeld. They are two points ahead of second-placed Orlando Pirates, which means Pitso Mosimane’s charges will have to beat Free State State at Goble Park Stadium on Saturday (3pm) to secure the title. Bucs host Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium at the same time.
