WHEN hijackers forced him out of his car in J Section, KwaMashu, KZN on Monday night, he was terrified. Dad Nkosi Ndlela was not worried about himself or his car, but his year-old son Bayanda, who was in the car. “For a minute, all sorts of things came to mind. I thought they would injure or kill my son,” he said. Nkosi had parked on Mpangele Road when two armed men forced him out of his car. He had driven there to speak to his first-born son, after his baby mama told him their son had been suspended from school for fighting. “It was only after they had driven off that I realised they were not only driving off with the car but with my son inside. I called my baby mama to tell her about it,” he said. Nkosi said he was grateful his son was later found by passersby who took him to the cop shop, and they were reunited. Witnesses said while Nkosi thought he needed to rush home to the baby mama to tell her, they advised him rather to go straight to the local cop shop. “We saw he was not thinking straight, so we drummed some sense into him. It was pointless to go to the baby mama, who couldn’t do anything. “But the police had the means to start circulating the information that a baby had been stolen along with a hijacked car,” said a witness. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “A case of carjacking is being investigated by KwaMashu cop shop. “The victim was seated in his parked car with his son sleeping in the back seat. He was approached by two armed men who forced him out of the car at gunpoint. “They fled with the victim’s one-year-old son, who was later found dumped on the side of the road not far from the scene. “The abandoned vehicle was found by Phoenix cop shop on Tuesday.”
