Several people are
fighting for their lives in hospital. This is after a taxi
and light motor vehicle collided on the R33 in Copesville, KwaZulu Natal
leaving seven people injured this morning. The ER24 spokesman,
Russel Meiring said the ER24 personnel, along with other services, arrived on
the scene to find the taxi in the middle of the road, while the light motor
vehicle had come to a stop on the pavement. Meiring said medics
assessed the patients and found that seven people had sustained injuries
ranging from minor to moderate. “Fortunately, no
serious injuries or fatalities were found,” Meiring said. “The patients were
treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported nearby hospitals for
further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene for further
investigations,” He added.
