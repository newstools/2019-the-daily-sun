THE people of Grabouw have a 24-hour clinic at last. The Western Cape town previously only had a clinic that closed at 7pm. Residents who needed urgent medical attention after hours were forced to travel 37km to Somerset or Caledon. In March, they protested to demand the provincial government build a hospital. Resident Noxolo Nkume said she almost died after an ambulance arrived late to take her to hospital. “I waited for more than two hours while struggling to breathe following an asthma attack,” she said. Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said: “We recently implemented improvement strategies to provide better care. This event is meant to show we put money to the promises we make and we’re serious about improving patient dignity.” Mbombo said, however, that a hospital needed to be built in the area. “The current service at the facility is no longer suitable to serve the growing population. The idea of a hospital in Grabouw is not far-fetched. But it would take up to five years to build it,” she said. “We will now start with upgrades to the existing facility and the process is scheduled to be completed by December.” Mthobeli Mandla, a member of the committee set up to communicate with the MEC following the protests, said he was happy with the progress. “We’re happy because she has done something to improve the lives of people in this community. We want to see this project completed and we will monitor it,” said Mandla. “Our call for a hospital in Grabouw still remains. We want a hospital in the area and we will wait for those five years if we have to.”
