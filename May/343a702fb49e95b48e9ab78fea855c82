“MORE FIRE ON THE PITCH” Thabo “Rasta” Mngomeni was a darling of the Orlando Pirates faithful’s in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was a self-confessed Rasta but he never tested positive for banned substances or Marijuana. He had a unique, distinct style of play that only himself could explain. His tiny body was like that of a snake, he could turn, swing it like he had no bones as he scored some beautiful goals – including a one scissors-kick for Bafana Bafana that was nominated and won the CAF Goal of the Year in 2001. The glorious bicycle kick was against Congo. He also delivered some spectacular performances for the Buccaneers and fans will always remember him for his trademark celebrations of punching the air, Rastafarian style whenever he scored a goal or acknowledged a praise. He also played for Bush Bucks and Hellenic in the PSL. Please share with us your most memorable Thabo Mngomeni moment?
