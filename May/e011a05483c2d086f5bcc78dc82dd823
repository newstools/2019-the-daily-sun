Social media is not being kind to Kaizer Chiefs. WHILE Mamelodi Sundowns were crowned PSL champions, Chiefs continues to be a big joke on social media. Since Kaizer Chiefs occupied position 7 on the log, it has become a laughing stock everywhere. In the process it earned nicknames such as Hola 7, Ma7 and 7De Laan. Now that Chiefs was beaten by Chippa United on Saturday, it moved from position 7 to 9. And it has now attracted new nicknames and continues to be ridiculed on social media.
