SUPPORTERS of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede have threatened to cause chaos if she’s removed. Scores of ANC members marched to the party’s provincial headquarters on Friday in support of the mayor and demanded to see party chairman Sihle Zikalala and secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli. The march was organised by ward chairmen and councillors. The marchers warned provincial leaders not to heed calls for Gumede’s axing. Zone chairman Ntando Khuzwayo said Gumede was targeted for political reasons by ANC leaders who didn’t want to see her re-elected as regional chairwoman. “We came to warn provincial leaders that if the mayor falls, we’ll fall with her,” he said. Khuzwayo, chairman of seven wards in eThekwini, said they were giving the PEC a week to respond or face their anger. He said they wanted assurance that Gumede would be allowed to finish her term, which is due to end in 2021. March organiser Mzomuhle Dube said Gumede must be removed only if she’s found guilty. The memorandum was accepted by PEC member Bheki Ntuli. Since Gumede’s arrest on Monday, pressure for her removal has been mounting. She and Councillor Mondli Mthembu are facing fraud and corruption charges.
