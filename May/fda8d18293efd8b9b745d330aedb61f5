MEMBERS of the Reitumetse Burial Society were horrified when it recently emerged that one of their own had been faking deaths. The crook had even produced fake funeral programmes to defraud the club, which is based in Hebron, near Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane. The woman is said to have claimed R4 000 this year alone. She apparently later confessed to another member that she had been scamming the club. Chairwoman Margarette Leburu (47) said members had long suspected the woman was faking deaths in her family. “She told us she didn’t have her family members’ phone numbers when we requested them. “She’s the youngest and newest member of our society, and we are tired of her evil acts.” Margarette said when they confronted her about what she had been doing, she didn’t appear surprised or shocked. “She just said she’d pay us back every month. We don’t want her any more. All we want is our money,” she said. Catherine Makhubela (72) said they had not encountered such problems in the past. “This money is meant for burying our loved ones. When someone does something so evil, it makes us angry,” she said. The club’s members decided to investigate after receiving a tip-off from a community member. “She’s the type of person who borrows money from people but never pays it back,” Catherine said. The club wants to open a case of fraud against her. The SunTeam tried to contact the woman but could not find her at her house.
