THE IFP has called for the urgent arrest of those who killed the party’s ward councillor in Maphumulo Municipality. Mfazo Nzuza (44), the ward 2 councillor in northern KZN, was gunned down at his house in KwaMambulu, near Kranskop by unknown suspects on Friday night. He allegedly met his death a short while after returning from campaigning in the area. IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala said they were very saddened by Nzuza’s death. “We don’t know the motive for the killing. This is why we want the police to provide us with answers,” said Gwala. “We cannot go on like this. For a very long time we have been calling for a thorough investigation into the increase of illegal firearms in our communities. “Our residents don’t feel safe anymore due to these random killings,” said Gwala. He said government needed to revive the gun amnesty so that residents had to hand in guns they shouldn’t have. “Our country badly needs this intervention. We urge government to recover illegal guns in our society which are in the hands of criminals,” said Gwala. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the ward councillor’s death. “A case of murder was opened at Kranskop cop shop for investigation. “We urge anyone who might have information on the killing of the ward councillor to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or Kranskop cop shop on 033 444 1604,” said Zwane.
