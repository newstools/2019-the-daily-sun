You know the scenario: You’ve been booked off with flu, and after a day or two your symptoms start easing up. You picture your email inbox exploding and your work piling up – and the next morning you brave the elements back to work. Hey, you'll be fine, and you're already feeling better, right? Before you know it, your legs feel wobbly and that achy, feverish feeling starts creeping up on you again. Maybe you should have taken another few days off... Flu, a sore throat, stomach bugs, the list goes on. Germs abound in winter, especially in confined air-conditioned office spaces. Taking enough time off to heal can be hard, especially when work is piling up and your symptoms are starting to abate. We look at some of the reasons why you absolutely shouldn’t return to work if you are sick, and how to know when your body is strong enough to get back to the office. When you should wait before going back to work: 1. Your illness is contagious You will risk making your colleagues sick. Diseases like influenza (flu) or the norovirus (stomach bug) spread easily through airborne droplets, human contact and shared surfaces. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incubation period for common illnesses starts before symptoms appear, which means you can be contagious even before you know you're sick.  Contagious diseases can quickly spread in public spaces, especially open-plan offices with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities. According to a previous Health24 article, it is recommended that you only go back to the office 24 hours after your fever breaks or after symptoms clear up to be entirely sure you are no longer contagious.
