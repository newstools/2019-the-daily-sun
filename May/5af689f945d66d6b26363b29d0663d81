STELLENBOSCH FC mentor Steve Barker was in seventh heaven as he led his charges to the promised land of the Absa Premiership. Stellies were crowned National First Division (NFD) champions and earned a spot in the land of milk and honey despite playing out to a hard fought 0-0 draw against Maccabi FC at the Idas Valley Stadium on Sunday. Stellies finished on 56 points, three ahead of second-placed Royal Eagles who suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to relegated Ubuntu Cape Town. Despite the win at home, Ubuntu finished second from bottom on 34 points and will join Witbank Spurs in the ABC Motsepe League next season. Ubuntu, who survived the dreaded drop on the final day of the season last year, ran out of luck this time around.Eagles will join Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) in the promotion play-offs set to start on 15 May. TTM beat Richards Bay 1-0 at Tohoyandou to edge the Urban Warriors to third place on goal difference with 51 points. Barker, who led the University of Pretoria to the PSL in 2012, praised his players. At the bottom, Cosmos survived relegation by the skin of their teeth after beating already relegated Spurs 4-0 at the KaNyamazane Stadium. They finished level on points with Barkerâ€™s former team, Tuks, on 35 points.
