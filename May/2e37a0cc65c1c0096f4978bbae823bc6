A lot of women face intense pain and muscle cramps during their periods. This might come to an end, especially for those who use tampons. This is because a company called Foria has created “cannabis vaginal suppositories”, designed to help them relieve these symptoms. Foria stated that the cannabis-laced tampons contain THC and CBD, the two main active cannabinoid compounds found in marijuana(60mg THC / 10mg CBD) which soothe pain, relax the muscles and nerves, and stimulate the release of happy chemicals in the brain.  “Women who have tried them claim that they are incredibly effective, but in order to purchase them, one needs to join Foria’s collective and depending on the state you live in, she might need to submit an application along with a physician’s recommendation letter. Additionally, a pack of four of these tampons costs $44,” the statement reads.  Foria also stated that some women have already tried it and it is excellent. The suppositories Foria Relief deliver the soothing benefits of full-spectrum cannabis directly to the area that needs it most and cause little or no psychoactive effects. They have also been independently-tested for purity, and are free of pesticides, heavy metals, microbes, and other toxins.
