THE police showed yesterday they are ready for the presidential inauguration tomorrow. Police Minister Bheki Cele inspected the officers who will be sent to Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Tshwane. Cele said they had put together plans to make sure everything ran smoothly. He said members of the police, Metro copse and other government departments would ensure the stadium was kept secure. “The success of this event, like previous events of this magnitude, is also dependent on the full co-operation of all those in attendance.” Cele said the gates would open at 3am and those attending were urged to arrive early. “No person under the influence of any substance will be allowed into the stadium for their own safety as well as the safety of others,” he said Cele said the police would make sure other areas were not neglected and all South Africans were safe. He urged people with pets living near the stadium to protect them. “Pet owners are advised to consider precautions during the 21-gun salute. The ideal place for an anxious dog is to be indoors, in a familiar place with its owner.”
