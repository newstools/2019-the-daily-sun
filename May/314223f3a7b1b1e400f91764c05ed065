PORTIA Modise is pleading with South Africans not to demand too much from Banyana Banyana players during the upcoming Fifa Women’s World Cup in France next month. Modise, who is the all-time leading goal scorer for Banyana, said too much expectations will put the girls who will be making their debut at the world showpiece under unnecessary pressure. She said this during the captains of the future launch in Joburg on Thirsday. The eighth edition of the Fifa Women’s World Cup will take place in nine cities of France, from 7 June until 7 July. Banyana will compete in Group B with the likes of Spain, Germany and China. Desiree Ellis’ charges will kick-off their campaign against Spain, who will be making the second appearance in the tournament, on 8 June at Stade Océane (6pm SA time). “This is our first experience at this stage, so we can’t put pressure on these players and say they must win their group or become second to qualify for the next round,” said Modise. Today, Banyana coach Ellis is expected to announce her final squad of 21 players who will represent Mzansi in France. Modise added: “For me, I would say girls should go out there and get the experience so that when they go back next time, they will get the desired results. Yes, some of them have been to two Olympic Games, but World Cup is another level.” Meanwhile, Modise will be scouting future talent for Allianz Explorer Camp in a tournament that will be played in Alexandra on 31 May. Two girls will be selected to represent Mzansi at the camp hosted by FC Bayern Munich in Germany later this year.
