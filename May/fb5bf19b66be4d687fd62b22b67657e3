ONE of the oldest local champions Walter “Black Mamba” Dlamini is determined to make his mark on world stage when he takes on Wanik Awdijan for the vacant IBO international middleweight title in Germany on 6 July. Dlamini, a late bloomer, is fishing for an international title glory, having won the national and World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African crowns last year, at the age of 39. The seasoned campaigner is now optimistic about victory outside of the country. “Getting the international title shot is a dream comes true,” he said. “I have been waiting for such a great opportunity my entire career. This is a dream come true. I promise you I will come back home with that title and make South Africa proud.” The much focused seasoned campaigner, who won his last three contests via a short route, said he won’t leave the fight to go the full distance. He blew away the interim SA champion Groth by sending him to slumber land in 42 seconds in the opening round to win the vacant WBA regional belt. On his last outing, he proved that his knockout victory to Fernando Rodrigues was not a fluke when he floored him on second round of their grudge rematch. “It is not easy to get points victory overseas, so our plan is to win with a knockout,” he said. “I’m ready and prepared for the fight. I have worked hard to knock him out.” The up-and-coming Awdijan has scored a points victory against Dlamini’s countryman and a friend, Nkululeko Mhlongo. “I have been speaking to Mhlongo to get information about him, so I know what to expect,” said Dlamini. The former four times SA amateur champion, who turned pro at 32, has compiled the professional record of 17 wins, six losses and four draws. Meanwhile, his 24- year-old opponent has chalked an impressive record 24 victory and a single defeat.
