ANGRY workers at one of Mzansi’s biggest chain stores downed tools on Thursday and Friday. They refused to work after one of the store managers allegedly used the k-word. But on Friday the situation changed at the Klerksdorp, North West, Checkers branch. This after a meeting between management, the union and workers. According to two shift packers, Thapelo Kibe and Lehlohonolo Mokwena, two managers came to them on 18 April with a note alerting them to a pending hearing. Thapelo said: “I told them I knew nothing about the allegations stated and I wasn’t going to sign it.” Thapelo said the manager threatened him. “I told them I was not afraid of them and that’s when one of them told me he wasn’t scared of k*ff*rs.” Sarita van Wyk, the store’s spokeswoman, said: “The allegations against the manager are viewed in a serious light. He has been suspended pending the a disciplinary inquiry.” After hearing that the manager, whose name is known to Daily Sun, was suspended, workers started work again. They took the matter to the South African Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union. But Lehlohonolo said the union had terminated their membership. The union’s provincial regional secretary, Thembani Jonas said: “We’re aware of the situation and advised them to raise their grievances with management. We’re awaiting results.” Cosatu provincial secretary Job Dliso said the matter will be referred to the Human Rights Commission.: “We call on the commission to investigate the incident where a white manager called a worker a k*ff*r.”
