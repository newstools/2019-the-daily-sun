It is moments like these that make us love live TV! Sizwe Dhlomo who is part of the new channelâ€™s Morning show tried to do a little stunt LIVE on TV and it ended with him ripping his pants! The stunt did not end well, and Sizwe will need a new pair of pants, but we have to give it to him for playing it cool. Thankfully there was no need for the video to be rated 18. You got to love Live TV, anything can really happen. Also, we see ratings going up thanks to this moemish. Watch the hilarious video below.
