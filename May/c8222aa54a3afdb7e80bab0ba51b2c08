PORTFOLIO head of economic development, tourism and agriculture in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, Noluthando Pink said most schools didn’t have a gardening project. Pink said: “It is vital to support small scale farmers in their quest to eradicate poverty in our communities. “We hope this partnership will yield good results and we will support them on a rotational basis so that every farmer has their chance.” She said they introduced the programme to schools because children should have farming knowledge so that they can be job creators instead of job seekers. “Do not underestimate the power of agriculture.” Koleka Dlova, a teacher at KwaMagxaki Secondary School, said she was pleased to have been chosen for the project. “I’m excited that the municipality has given us equipment. I’m going to introduce vegetable gardening at the school,” she said. “I hold a qualification in agriculture.” The municipality donated hosepipes, wheelbarrows, shovels and other equipment.
