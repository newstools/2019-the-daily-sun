GUGU Nkosi’s life has become a nightmare. The 20-year-old from Kliptown, Soweto, told Daily Sun she’s never had a birth certificate and had to use her mum’s ID to write matric. She said after she passed her exams, she became very depressed. She wanted to further her studies but couldn’t because of the ID problem. “I couldn’t even apply for a bursary.” Gugu said she didn’t know what to do anymore. “I’ve been sent from one Home Affairs to another. “The officials tell me different things. They even say I’m not on the system.” Gugu said she even tried to apply for work but couldn’t because of the ID problem. “I could have been successful in my job hunt if I had an ID.” Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane said Gugu’s mum needed to do a late registration of birth application. He confirmed that Gugu was not registered with the department. “Requirements for a late registration of birth include completing relevant forms at the office, providing ID size photos, and handing in copies of the parents’ IDs or passports,” said Hlabane. “The application will then be processed for the issuing of a birth certificate and an ID number. “Once the ID number and birth certificate have been issued, the child may apply for a smart ID card.”
