FORMER chairwoman of the Independent Electoral Commission, Dr Brigalia Bam, has called on South Africans to vote on 8 May. Bam was a guest speaker at a Freedom Day event organised by the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation. It was held at the Old Granary Building in Cape Town on Saturday. Bam said she was concerned by the growing voter indifference among young people. “I’m very upset to hear people saying, ‘I’m not going to vote’. If you are not going to vote, what is going to change? “Once you vote, you are taking a stand to say, ‘I’m a citizen of this country and have a right to make certain demands on government because I have appointed those people’.”“But if you sit at home, you cannot claim because you didn’t appoint them,” she said. She said people felt apathetic as a result of the corruption that has been taking place around the country. When asked how Freedom Day was 25 years ago, Bam said it was a mixed bag of emotions but the fact that it was the first time black people were allowed to vote made the day special. I was part of the team that went all over the country overseeing the elections. I didn’t sleep much because of excitement and exhaustion,” she said. Marlene le Roux, chairwoman of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, also urged young people to vote. “It doesn’t matter who you are voting for, do it on principle,” she said.
