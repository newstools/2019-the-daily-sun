IT'S a little easier for UCT graduates to find jobs. More than 50% of the University of Cape Town's (UCT)
2018–2019 graduates are employed in South Africa’s private sector, with
over 20% earning more than R20 000 a month. The latest Graduate Exit Survey has confirmed that UCT graduates are highly ranked in
terms of their employability. And most of them are well paid. The survey was conducted by the Careers Service unit in the Centre for Higher Education and Development (CHED). The 2019 Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) Graduate Employability
Rankings support the statistics, with UCT ranked top in Africa and 18th in the
world for graduate employment. A total of 4 791 students responded to the survey during
the June 2018 to April 2019 graduation season. The private sector emerged as
the leading employer of 53.46% of graduates, with 19.71% employed in the public
sector, and 6.01% by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In respect of
their monthly earnings, the research indicated that 23.39% of students earn
between R20 000 and R30 000, 16.14% earn between R15 001 and R20 000, and 5.21%
between R5 001 and R7 000. Nawaal Boolay, Careers Service acting director, said the
annual survey results help them enhance their service offering to students, and
also assist in the development of partnerships with potential employers with a
view to increasing the number of employed students. “The results this year show that UCT graduates remain
highly sought after,” she said. Around 80% of UCT’s class of 2018 are “meaningfully
occupied”. Of these, 44.48% are employed, 30.78% are studying further and 3.75%
are self-employed. Survey results reveal the Faculty of Health Sciences as
the top performing faculty in terms of graduate employability, with 69.94% of
all medical students employed at the time of the survey. Close behind was the
Faculty of Law, with 63.39% of students employed. Only 10.71% of UCT’s 2018 graduates are still seeking
employment. “We continue to support these graduates through our
online job portal, [one-on-one] career consultations, job expos and career
development workshops. “Graduates have access to our service for up to three
years after graduating,” she said. SOURCE: UCT NEWS
