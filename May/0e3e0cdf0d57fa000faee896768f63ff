Hey MizzB I WENT to my local clinic twice and the nurses said they didn’t have contraceptives. They gave me another date, and upon my return they were still not available. My boyfriend doesn’t want to use a condom as he says it hurts him. I’m now 16 years old and pregnant. I’m willing to do anything to end my pregnancy. I’m not ready for this and my parents are going to freak out. Please help me!  Hey Girl child You are scared and confused, and this is normal for a young person. I’m proud of you for having the courage to seek help. The only safe way to have an abortion is to go to a registered healthcare provider. This will protect your womb and save your life. Unsafe sex also puts you at a risk of STIs and HIV, so it is important that you look into female condoms and go to other clinics to get free contraceptives.
