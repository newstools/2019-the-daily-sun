THE Moletjie community outside Polokwane, Limpopo, is grieving following the death of their queen mother, Mmakgabo Moloto, of the Bahlaloga tribe. She was 83. Moloto died at her home at Moletjie Moshate on Friday. She led the Bahlaloga from 1980 after her husband, Koena, died until her son, Chief Kgabo Moloto III, came of age in 1996. Royal family spokesman Matuma Moloto said they were saddened by the death of their pillar of strength. “As the Bahlaloga nation, we hope her departed soul will rest in eternal peace,” he said. Her funeral will be held on Sunday at a special burial place at the royal home. The queen mother was praised for strengthening the royal house and uniting the community after her husband’s death. Royal praise singer Jimmy Moloto said the Bahlaloga should unite at this time. He said they must work to improve their lives as the queen mother would have wanted. Another praise singer, Thulamsindo Rapotu, said: “She fought but succumbed to death and transitioned to her creator and ancestors, the Bakone and Bahlaloga. Her majesty queen mother is at peace. “May her soul rest in power.”
