THE ANC in the Western Cape has accused DA members of removing the party’s campaign posters from the streets. With less than a week to go before South Africa goes to the polls, on 8 May, the rivalry between the two main political parties in the province is heating up. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs said two criminal cases had been opened. “In both instances, we found it was DA supporters who ripped off our posters,” Jacobs claimed. “These are examples of desperation. They can try to take off the posters of our president (Cyril Ramaphosa), but his work and image are there in our people’s minds,” said Jacobs. The incidents allegedly happened a week ago. The DA’s premier candidate, Alan Winde, said he was not aware of reports about his supporters ripping off posters. “I will find out, but I’m not aware of it. I know in election time there are always these things. “If it is true, we need to make sure that this does not happen,” he said. Police have confirmed two arrests. In one instance the case was withdrawn. ANC Western Cape election head Ebrahim Rasool said some posters were twisted by vandals so they faced the bush and not the road.
