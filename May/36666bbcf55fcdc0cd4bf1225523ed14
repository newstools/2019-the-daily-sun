JUST after the shops had opened in the busy Commercial Road in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday morning, a sound of gun shots forced the shoppers to run into different directions while others took a cover. One of the shopkeepers was allegedly shot by two unknown men for a pie. One of the hawkers told Daily Sun, "One of them came near my stall carrying a firearm. He stood behind a bakkie. I thought he was going to break into it. But to my shock he changed his clothes and went down towards the taxi rank as if he had done nothing. Another bystander said: "After the shooting I saw two men carrying firearms and crossing the road. I could not believe my eyes because these guys were cool and calm. While from the shop we saw the foreign shopkeepers rushing the victim to the hospital in a private car. "He was heavily bleeding from the upper body. People who were closer to him said he had suffered two gunshot wounds in the head." One of the shopkeepers from Pakistan said: "How can a good guy like him get shot for a pie? This has spoilt my day. Why someone can just lose his life over a pie? "His shop is well protected with burglars in fear of these drug addicts who rob us every day." Colonel Priscilla Naidu said, "It is alleged that at about 9:30am, the suspect walked into a take away shop in Commercial Road and ordered a pie. But the suspect did not take the pie. "The owner who was at the door was shot twice in the chest. The suspect ran away and the victim, Anamul Mohammed (36) died on his way to hospital. The motive of the shooting is unknown." A case of murder was opened but no one arrested.
