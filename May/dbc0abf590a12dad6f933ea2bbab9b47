TV Host and Comedian Trevor Noah has received Best Host nominee at the MTV Awards, going up against Gayle King, Nick Cannon and RuPaul in the category. It was just two months ago when Trevor almost saw an end to his TV host days at the daily show, as it faced being pulled off air. Reports in March claimed that American broadcast service provider AT&T-DirectTV was planning to drop Comedy Central and 22 other channels. Trevor took to social media shortly after the reports surfaced to ask fans to call in and tell service providers they simply can't do without his show. The SA-born comedian won his first Emmy two years ago for his YouTube comedy special The Daily Show: Between the Scenes.
