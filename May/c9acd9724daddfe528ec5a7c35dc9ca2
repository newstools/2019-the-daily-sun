SINCE last September, pupils have been collapsing and screaming in unexplained fits during class. Last month it became worse. Three weeks ago, parents at Mpheleng Primary School in Dennilton, Mpumalanga closed down the school. Ally Ramoshaba (42), chairman of the Education Crisis Committee, told Daily Sun seven years ago incidents like this happened and a sangoma was called to perform rituals. “In September about 24 girls, mostly in grade 5, collapsed. Pastors from various churches were called to pray but the situation became worse and we decided to close the school on 30 April.” On Friday, a sangoma came to the school and removed muthi from the premises. “The sangoma told us there was an invisible snake at the school that only pupils could see, which caused them to collapse,” said Ramoshaba. “He told us teachers at the school were also fighting for positions.” Limpopo Education Department spokesman Sam Makondo said: “The department will not close a school. We have an academic programme that must be completed. “We can’t afford to miss teaching time and parents must understand that.”
