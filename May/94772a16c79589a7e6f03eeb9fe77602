REIGNING Spar Women’s Grand Prix princess, Glenrose Xaba, says that she will give the FNB Cape Town12 ONERUN on 19 May a miss due to a niggling ankle injury. Speaking to SunSport, Xaba says her main priority at this stage is the Spar Women’s 10km challenge set for Cape Town on 26 May. She finished the Port Elizabeth edition of the challenge in ninth place on Saturday due to the ankle that made it difficult for her. “I wanted to increase my speed, but the pain was becoming severe,” she said having played second fiddle to Helalia Johannes and Kesa Molotsane. Look, I am not complaining that I did not make a podium finish during the Spar race. “I know that the challenge is still far from being finished. I will always listen to my body and not risk suffering a serious injury because of one race.” Xaba said her focus now is on her recovery first before hitting the treadmill and train hard in order to win the Cape Town edition of the race challenge. The challenge will be in Cape Town on 26 May before athletes move on Durban on 23 June.
