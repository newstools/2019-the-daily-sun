WAAR WAS JY? Thabo “Tsiki-Tsiki Yo” Mooki is one of a very few players who started his career at Kaizer Chiefs and ended it at the same club. Players come and go, but Mooki, born in Soweto entertained Amakhosi fans in the 15 years that he spent at the club with his silky skills and dribbling tricks. Wearing the famous No 12 jersey, he was nicknamed “Tsiki-Tsiki” after 90s Kwaito his song by Mdu Masilela. Mooki was a very sly player. He did not talk to much or walk around the club house like he owned the place. But just pass him the ball on the D-line and something, either a goal or an assist was bound to come by. He played about 350 matches for Chiefs and scored some amazing goals. Sadly, when he retired in 2009, he was not honoured with a Benefit Match, something that a left a bitter taste on the club’s supporters after Mooki had dedicated all of his career to the club – it was a pity! What’s your fondest memory of Tsiki-Tsiki Mooki?
