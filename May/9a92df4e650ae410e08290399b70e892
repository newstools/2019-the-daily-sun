as Mzansi people cast their votes. Mzansi held
its sixth democratic National and Provincial elections, as it plays a vital
part of any democracy to guarantee that voting takes place in an atmosphere which
is considered free and fair. South
Africans from all walks of life participated in the democratic process of
voting for a political party of their choice - that will govern the country over
the next five years. The outcome

National Assembly and the Provincial Legislatures.
