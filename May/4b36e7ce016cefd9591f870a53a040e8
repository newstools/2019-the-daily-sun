 The Orlando Stadium has been painted red today.  Scores of EFF supporters filled up the stadium ahead of Julius Malema’s address later today.    Malema will be giving his fighters a final rally cry ahead of the election on Wednesday.   Both the ANC and EFF rallys are in Soweto today as was the DA’s yesterday. Gauteng is a hotly contested province and all parties are looking to flex their muscle this weekend.
