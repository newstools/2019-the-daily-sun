ANGRY residents have demanded a by-election to replace their councillor. According to residents who protested in Umlazi, south of Durban, Mthokozisi Nojiyeza had to go. He was accused of killing ANC councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo in October. After Nojiyeza and two relatives were released from prison on Friday, residents camped outside Nojiyeza’s office and demanded that it be closed. On Tuesday, they blocked the road leading to his office in V section with burning tyres. They clashed with supporters of the councillor, who tried to force their way into the office. A local leader vowed to keep the office closed until the ANC declared a by-election. He said residents couldn’t be led by someone who had been accused of such a serious crime. “Residents are scared to be led by someone who’s suspected of having committed murder,” the leader told Daily Sun. “We’re aware that the court released him because there was not enough evidence, but the magistrate didn’t say he was innocent.” Another resident claimed the councillor only hired people from E section, where he lived. She said they won’t budge on the issue until municipal leaders addressed them. Thembelani Nondunge, a supporter of the councillor, said they were protecting the office after protesters tried to burn it down. Thami Mdluli from the mayor’s office promised to take the protesters’ demands to the ANC. ANC regional spokesman Nkosenhle Madlala said the party would meet with residents. But there couldn’t be a by-election because the case was struck off the roll. Attempts to get hold of Nojiyeza were unsuccessful.
