Musa Masia (50) was found dead at his rental room in Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge, in Mpumalanga on Tuesday morning. Collins Masia (58), his brother, told Daily Sun that on Wednesday, he received a call from Musa asking to be rushed to Tintswalo Hospital. “He didn’t sound well when he spoke to him over the phone,” said Collins. He said when they arrived at Musa’s place, they tried calling him but got no response. They then called the police. With the help of the police, they broke into the room. But it was already too late – paramedics certified him dead. “As a family we have accepted that he is no more, and no foul play is suspected as he has been on medication since November,” Collins said. Sad colleague Cecil Delivo (35) said Musa’s death has left a void. “We’ve lost a hero. He was a good guy in our team since 2010. We worked together, selling the People’s Paper in Thulamahashe, Bushbuckridge and Acornhoek,” said Delivo. Collins said they are planning to take Musa to his final resting place this Saturday. The service will be held at his home in Thulamahashe at 7am. Captain Mpho Nonyane said the police are not investigating a case as the family told them they knew Musa was sick.
