SUPERSPORT United CEO Stan Matthews has revealed that midfielder Teboho Mokoena will soon jet off to France for a trial with an unnamed club. The 22-year-old developed into a consistent performer for Matsatsantsa, having made his first-team debut under Stuart Baxter in 2017. His progress this season under coach Kaitano Tembo has sparked interest from abroad, but Matthews insists that interested clubs will have to trigger the player's release clause if they hope to secure his services. "Teboho has a trial coming on in France in July. Again, if his buy-out-clause is exercised, we will not stand in his way," Matthews told IOL Sport. "He is a great young man with great future ahead of himself. If he doesn't do it now, it is okay."He is with us and he is under contract with us for the few more years."And it seems Mokoena has also attracted admiring glances in South Africa, with Sundowns recently credited with an interest in the player.However, Matthews is adamant the midfielder won't sign for one of the club's local rivals."We don't see a move for Teboho in the local market as a move at all," Matthews added. "We think that Teboho is good enough to go and play overseas."Why should he set a bar in other teams as a substitute like it has happened with some of my star players in the past."They have been revolutionary with me but gone on to be fantastic bench warmers and grandstand watchers. We are not going to allow that to happen to Teboho."
