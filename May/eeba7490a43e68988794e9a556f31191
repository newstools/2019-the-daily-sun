CRIMINALS are getting smarter every day. These days, they steal in broad daylight and sometimes they even use branded cars and uniforms to seem like official workers. But cops in Hillbrow, Joburg, were not fooled when they spotted a branded bakkie on the street near Joubert Park yesterday. Police told Daily Sun they became suspicious after seeing the bakkie had been there for a long time. Hillbrow police spokesman Captain Musa Shihambe said cops found a tool used to open drains. “Cops ordered the driver to open the drainage system he was parked next to and three men carrying copper cables came out. They were all arrested for possession of copper. “They will appear in the Hillbrow Magistrates Court soon,” said Shihambe. He urged residents to report any criminal activities in the area. “If you fear that your life might be in danger, you can also report incidents anonymously. “We can’t fight this battle alone. “We can only win it with your help,” he said. Resident Moses Mkhonza (35) told the People’s Paper he saw the bakkie but didn’t suspect anything was wrong. “It was marked as if it was a company there to do legitimate work,” Moses said.
