GOGO Tseleng Moroe was lookiing forward to casting her vote on her 100th birthday, but it was not to be. IEC officials, who were supposed to visit her house in Bochabela in Mangaung for special voting, never pitched up! “On Monday and Tuesday, I waited for them until sunset. “I couldn’t go to the voting station on Wednesday because I didn’t have money to hire a car and I can’t walk long distances. “I’m old and wanted to celebrate my birthday in style. I’m so disappointed and worried I’ll never get a chance to vote again.” The gogo said she celebrated her 100th birthday with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren on Wednesday. When asked about her secrets for a long life, she advised people to respect their elders and never to touch alcohol. “I eat vegetables, boiled eggs and fruit. I don’t eat meat. I’m still strong and can clean the house,” she said. “When I was young I won beauty pageants. I was beautiful and I’m still beautiful.” Her daughter Nandipha Shokoshela said she was very grateful to God for giving her such a strong mum. “I learned a lot from her and I hope she has many more years. “We were very disappointed when she couldn’t vote. We waited for IEC officials to come but it never happend. I’m worried this might affect her health,” she said. IEC spokeswoman Mmathabo Rasengane said the gogo never applied for a special vote. “She doesn’t appear on our system. I think the form didn’t reach the IEC offices,” she said.
