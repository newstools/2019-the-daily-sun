TRADERS and security guards are at loggerheads at Bree Taxi Rank. This resulted in one person being shot on Friday. Traders stationed outside the rank were allegedly involved in a scuffle after being terrorised by the guards. They accused the guards of illegally confiscating their goods and forcibly removing them from their stands. Witness James Chauke (33) said the tension grew when the traders started throwing stones at the guards. “Things got out of hand when one of the guards pulled out a gun and fired three times,” he said. “I saw someone bleeding in the face and I think that is where he was shot.” He said most traders were tired of being bullied by the private security guards operating in the area. “The security guards are interfering with our businesses and they are impersonating officials from the Joburg Metro police.” “I can confirm there was shooting and the matter has been escalated to the police for further investigation,” said Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. “We don’t know who those people are. They don’t work for the department. We plead with the public to report to us if they see an officer working with any of these so called security guards,” he said. “We work with various security companies in the city for a good cause, not to cause harm to ordinary citizens.” Minnaar said whoever shot the trader should be arrested. No arrests have been made
