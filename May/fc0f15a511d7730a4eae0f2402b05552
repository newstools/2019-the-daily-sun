THE three friends were always seen together. Now Thuthukani Dladla (26), Thokozani Mdlalose (26) and Mabutho Ntuli (26) have died together. The young men from Ematimatolo, KZN, were gunned down in Msinga where they had gone to consult a sangoma on Friday. Thuthukani’s cousin, Sibusiso Langa (31), said they couldn’t believe what they saw when they were called to the scene by the police. “It was horrible. They had gunshot wounds all over their bodies, especially in their heads,” said Sibusiso. He said he had no idea why the friends were killed. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “Three counts of murder were opened at Msinga Police Station. “This was after three people were shot dead in their Toyota Etios at the Mabaso area of Msinga on Friday. The motive for the shooting is unknown.”
