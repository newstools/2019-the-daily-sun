HOPE Mkhize realised her relationship was toxic and dumped her lover. But her wise decision apparently proved to be a very bad idea. Hope (26) told the People’s Paper the decision cost her the life of her mum. She narrowly escaped death. The man she had dumped allegedly went to her home at Mzimhlophe Hostel in Soweto and opened fire on the mum and daughter. Hope’s mum died on the spot and Hope was rushed to hospital. The incident happened earlier this month and police are still looking for the boyfriend. When the SunTeam spoke to Hope, she asked not to be photographed. “All I want is for him to be arrested,” she said. “Maybe my life will get back to normal after that.” Hope said she’s been living in fear ever since the shooting happened. “I don’t understand. It’s just me and him who were fighting,” she said. Police told Daily Sun they were looking for Mziwoxolo Cele to question him about events that happened at Mzimhlophe Hostel earlier this month. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Thebe urged anyone with information to contact their nearest police station. Alternatively, one can phone the CrimeStop tip-off number 0800 10111.
