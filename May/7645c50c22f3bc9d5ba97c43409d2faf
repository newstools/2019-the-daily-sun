IT HAS been barely two days since the 80 man-strong Metro cops reaction unit was sent to Joburg CBD hot spots. And three crimes have already been foiled. This was what public safety MMC Michael Sun told Daily Sun recently. The unit, launched on Wednesday, had already started working the next day. The first bust was that of a 21-year-old man who snatched a taxi passenger’s phone through an open window. “The suspect was detained at Hillbrow Police Station. “Unfortunately, in a separate incident, a metro cop was wounded when four suspects opened fire on officers who approached them during a patrol. “The officer was taken to Milpark Hospital for treatment and is thankfully stable.” Sun said in another incident, a hijacking at the corner of True Road and Main Reef Road in Fordsburg was spotted on CCTV. “Officers were sent to the scene, where they were confronted by three armed men hijacking a woman. “The suspects opened fire and unfortunately got away. “However, the unit was successful in stopping a hijacking in progress. “I made it clear to the unit that they should do everything in their means to ensure criminals are taken down.” He said crime won’t be tolerated. “I applaud these brave men and women who risk their own safety in order to protect our residents.” Sun said anyone with information about the suspects that got away should call Metro cops on 011 375 5911.
