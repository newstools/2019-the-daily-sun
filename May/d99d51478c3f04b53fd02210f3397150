ZODWA Wabantu is not worried about the professor who says their marriage arrangements may cause problems in their love life. Earlier this month she proposed to her Ben 10 Ntobeko Linda, who works at a bank in Durban and has agreed to take her surname. Cultural expert Jabulani Maphalala believes what they’re doing is against tradition. Although Ntobeko’s family seemed fine with the fact that Zodwa will send her uncles to pay lobola for him, Maphalala warned the couple. He told Daily Sun: “In our culture, the man sends his uncles to pay lobola for the woman. When they get married, she takes the man’s surname.” He said this was the first time he’s heard of a woman who’ll lobola a man and take her surname. “It is shocking!” But he admitted it was their choice. “I’m afraid this will affect their love, though. I think their ancestors will turn their backs on them and cause trouble in their marriage.” Zodwa said she respects people who do rituals but doesn’t believe in tradition and, according to her, she doesn’t have ancestors. “If a person is dead they’re dead and have no power over a living person. My mum died and she can never bring luck to me. I don’t even use muthi. I pray and I do things my way. No tradition or ancestor can harm our love.” Sunday Sun previously reported that Zodwa’s mother-in-law Khanyo Linda had said the family accepted Zodwa as their makoti and were waiting for her uncles to do lobola negotiations.
