WHEN the rain started after President Cyril Ramaphosa voted, a gogo was heard saying: “These are the blessings.” The president was with his wife at the Hitekani Primary School in Chiawelo, Soweto. After casting his vote he said: “This turnout shows that victory is certain for the ANC.” The guards and police had a difficult time pushing the huge crowd away from the smiling president. “The changes this government has brought are already being felt,” he said. “Before the end of this week history will be made,” he said. He said they would discuss coalitions after the results have been announced. “The EFF will accept whatever number we get. We want to govern South Africa without a coalition,” he said. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa voted at Arcadia Primary School. “For me it’s been a new journey. Your vote can bring change,” she said. ANC election head Ebrahim Rasool and his wife Roshieda cast their votes at the same polling station. Western Cape DA Premier candidate said the rain should not stop people from voting. Deputy president David Mabuza voted at Ajuri farm, outside Barberton. “People can express themselves through the ballot,” he said. Mpumalanga premier, Refilwe Mtshweni voted at Vosman in Emalahleni.
