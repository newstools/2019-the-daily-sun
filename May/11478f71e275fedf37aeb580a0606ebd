AFRICAN music was the order of the day during the Bassline Festival at Constitution Hill, Joburg, on Saturday. The festival was meant to celebrate Africa Day. Famous Nigerian artists Asa and Mr Eazi performed at the event. Other artists who performed on the day were The Soil’s Buhlebendalo and Dobet Gnahore from Ivory Coast. The festival also celebrated 25 years of democracy and its 25th anniversary. Newly elected speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise and chairman of the National Council of Provinces Amos Masondo said more still needed to be done as the continent was still affected by poor governance. “As parliament, we note the considerable progress our continent has achieved in social, economic, scientific, technological and cultural development. We also note our prominent role in building a just and democratic world order,” said Modise.
