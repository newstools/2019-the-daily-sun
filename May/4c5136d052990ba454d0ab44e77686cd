A MUM rescued her beloved son from a fire on Sunday but ended up losing all her belongings. Thembeka Dlala (56) from Govan Mbeki kasi in Port Elizabeth said her son Monezi (32) was more important than a car, shack, furniture and personal documents. “At about 9pm on Sunday, I was lying in bed after attending a traditional function with my son,” Thembeka told Daily Sun “I smelled smoke and thought he was smoking cigarettes. “I went to his shack, which is attached to mine, to put him in his place.  When I got there the shack was already on fire. “He was dizzy and didn’t know what was happening, but I got him out.” Thembeka said she believed her son fell asleep with a candle on because the bulb in his room wasn’t working. “I don’t blame him for the fire but family members do.” Monezi said thanks to his mum, he escaped with only minor burns to his hand. Thembeka said she needed help to rebuild her shack, or temporary housing now that winter’s here. Nelson Mandela Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki told the People’s Paper: “She must go and see her councillor, who’ll co-ordinate with the relevant offices.”
