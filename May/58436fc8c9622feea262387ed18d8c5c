A SERVICE delivery protest turned ugly when protesters set fire to a municipal building and blocked the road with stones on Saturday. Hundreds of residents of Senekal, in the Free State took to the streets to make sure their demands were heard. The Setsoto Municipality has been under fire for the past seven months. Residents claim the municipality made promises before the election but nothing’s been done to resolve their issues with running water and electricity. Others said they have been waiting for RDP homes for more than 25 years. “We cannot live like this,” said a resident. “Our officials use our votes and give us promises. The community decided to burn the municipality down because it is no use to us.” She said she couldn’t remember when they last had running water. And often the water trucks don’t arrive.” Municipal spokesman Mboweni Letlama said a municipal office in Matwabeng was set alight. Chairs at the EE Monese Hall in Matwabeng were burnt but the hall was not damaged. “Officials are unable to work in that office and have been placed elsewhere,” he said. “The municipality acknowledges the challenges the community raised.” He said they constantly speak to the community, the office of the Traditional Affairs MEC, and other involved parties. Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said 45 people were arrested and charged with public violence.
