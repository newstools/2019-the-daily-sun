HE is nursing wounds after being moered by an mlungu farmer who accused him of stealing a cow. Amos Vilakazi (28) from Holmdene, near Vlaklaagte farm in Standerton in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun the mlungu approached him on 13 May and demanded to check his cows. The cows were grazing on the farm where Amos lives. “I recently bought a calf for R5 500 from a gogo. It was close to the cow and it took a few days for it to get used to a new environment. “The calf cried a lot. The mlungu thought I’d stolen it and came to interrogate me at my farm.” Amos said even after proving it was not stolen, the farmer insisted it wasn’t his and told him his own cows were missing. “Police had to be called and we took the calf to the seller so everyone could be clear about the whole thing. When we got there, the calf went straight to its mother to be fed, but that was still not proof enough,” he said. Dingumuzi Mpila (55), who witnessed the incident, said: “He nearly killed my son and was never arrested.” Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said a case of assault was opened. A 28-year-old man was bust and will appear in court soon.
