SHE has been struggling to get an ID for more than 40 years. But all she got were excuses from Home Affairs in Polokwane, Modjadjiskloof and Alexandra. Gogo Maria Selahla (63) from Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, said her parents never applied for a birth certificate and ID for her. She said she tried to apply for an ID in 1976 with no success. “When Nelson Mandela became president, my younger sister tried to help me get an ID in Alexandra, but failed.” Gogo Maria said Home Affairs officials told her they wanted a letter from the school she attended, but she could not produce one as she never went to school. “In 2010, I tried again to get an ID at the Modjadjiskloof Home Affairs and they took all my information and fingerprints, but I still did not get it. I’m frustrated because my life is stuck and it’s as if I do not exist.” She said she was once told her ID was available at the Pretoria office, but she has not received it. “I went to the Polokwane branch, but was chased away and told to go back to the Modjadjiskloof. “I have spent thousands of rands on transport, but have nothing to show for it,” said Maria. She told Daily Sun officials from the Giyani branch went to her home in February and told her they would investigate, but she has not received any feedback. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said gogo Maria’s matter was referred to the Home Affairs Limpopo provincial manager. “The manager will delegate an official to contact the client to resolve the matter,” said Mokgola.
