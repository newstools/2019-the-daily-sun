Lamontville Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela believes their “terrible” start to their match against Mamelodi Sundowns was their downfall. Abafana Bes’thende went down 2-0 to defending champions Downs in their Absa Premiership encounter at Loftus Stadium on Tuesday. First half goal by Captain Hlomho Kekana and Themba Zwane were enough to sink Arrows. Khomphela was left to rue his side’s slow start to the game. “We had a bad start, terrible first 10 minutes and it defined the whole of the match,” Khompela told SuperSport TV after the match. “First half, we struggled but we got better around the 30th minute but it was a bit too late, especially against a team like Sundowns away from home. “One mistake we made in the 10 minutes of disaster was that we didn’t get close to them, we were not aggressive in cutting the runner on top of the box, we allowed them to penetrate with ease and we paid the price.” Despite the defeat, the KZN club are still hopeful of sneaking into the top eight. They are currently in tenth spot with 36 points, two points adrift of a top eight position. Arrows host Bidvest Wits at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday (3pm) in their final match of the season.
