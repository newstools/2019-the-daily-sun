THE dominance of North Africans in the Caf Champions League cannot be overstated. In between them, clubs from Egypt, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia have won six titles in the last eight years, with the Club of the Century, Al Ahly, claiming two trophies. Apart from DR Congo giants TP Mazembe, no team has come close to breaking the North African hegemony. But Pitso Mosimane reckons Mamelodi Sundowns have made great strides with regular appearances in the continental tournament. “To win the Champions League it’s another story, hey,” said the Sundowns coach, in light of their semifinal exit at the hands of Wydad Casablanca at the weekend. “Champions League is played in a different way. But we now understand and how to play with the North Africans. We have figured them out. But we are yet to conquer them. “We are the only team in the SADC region that has figured out the North African, except of course, TP Mazembe (Central Africa). “You should read the article on the dominance of North Africans to have a better understanding of how they plan their budget and how they recruit the players and coaches. They pay big salaries. But remember, these clubs have history. They were playing the Champions League when we were still in apartheid in SA.”
