MAYOR Zandile Gumede is facing another challenge. Dozens of refuse collectors employed by the expanded public works programme marched to the municipal headquarters yesterday. They gave the mayor seven days to give them permanent jobs or they will shut down the city. One of the workers told Daily Sun she’s been a casual since 2008. She couldn’t understand how the municipality can say it doesn’t have money when it raised former Umkhonto weSizwe soldiers’ pay to R20 000. “If the municipality can afford to pay uneducated people like us R20 000, surely there is money to pay us too. Said another worker: “We’re giving the mayor seven days to give us what we want, or else we’ll bring the city to a standstill.” March organiser Sibusiso Mkhize said workers were tired of being exploited. He said workers wanted to earn from R8 000 upwards, and that some are qualified to become supervisors. He also demanded that councillors should not be a part of the expanded public works programme because they threaten to fire them when they raise grievances. The workers demanded to see the mayor personally to give her the memorandum, but she refused to come out. She sent public works manager Bongani Hlophe to receive it on her behalf. Hlophe said the mayor was sympathetic to casual workers and would address their problems soon.
