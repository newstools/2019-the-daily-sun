THREE months have gone by since cops allegedly beat Xolisa Mielies (34), and he’s still waiting for his case to be investigated. Xolisa, a bouncer at Coke’s Tavern in Motherwell, said cops stormed into the nightclub on 5 March and started beating and kicking patrons. “I saw people running for cover,” Xolisa said. “People who tried to take videos were beaten.” He told Daily Sun cellphones were confiscated by cops and never returned. Xolisa said they choked him while kicking and beating him. “My face was swollen and I couldn’t see properly. I sustained multiple body injuries.” His leg, which was injured in a car accident, was injured again. Xolisa said he saw a doctor, who gave him a medical report which he took to Motherwell police. “I opened a case of assault, but there hasn’t been any feedback. I don’t know why they did it. “They didn’t identify themselves. I want these cops arrested.” Captain Andre Beetge, said: “We’ve sent his docket to Ipid.”
