WHEN Stephina Sono applied for an RDP about five years ago, she was full of hope. But her dream was shortlived. She hasn’t had any feedback. “I don’t want to die in this house. I’m scared for my life,” said Stephina (68). “It hurts to see young people around me living in RDPs. What about me?” The gogo lives in a three-roomed house in Ledig, outside Rustenburg in North West, and fears the house might fall in on her one day. She’s unable to walk long distances without feeling pain in her legs.  She moves around using a wheelchair and crutch for support. She said the ceiling in one of the rooms caved in one night while she was asleep. “I applied for a second phase house, but people who applied after me got houses instead,” she said “I don’t know what happened, or why. I just need a house.” Moses Kotane acting spokesman Dirang Radiokana said the municipality was aware of gogo’s problem. “However, applying and filling in a housing subsidy form doesn’t qualify an applicant automatically. “The municipality isn’t responsible for approving beneficiaries. “The applications go through various verification processes on the national housing application systems.” Stephina has to reapply.
