MAMELODI Sundowns will score against Wydad Casablanca in the Caf Champions League semi-final second leg at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3pm), no matter what. This is the assurance made by the Brazilians head coach Pitso Mosimane to their fans ahead of their must-win clash against the 2017 champions. Downs scored a crucial away goal in Morocco last Friday, despite suffering a 2-1 defeat in the first leg played at Mohammed V Stadium. The former Bafana Bafana mentor said this after his side beat relegation haunted Black Leopards 2-1 in an Absa Premiership match played at Thohoyandou Stadium on Tuesday night to get level with log leaders Orlando Pirates on 53 points. Mosimane knows that the Tshwane giants must get a goal and ensure Casablanca don’t concede to reach the final. “One thing for sure – we always score at all time in Atteridgeville – so I am not worrying about goals,” said Mosimane. “My concern is to stop Casablanca from scoring. We have to fight to hang in there. “Hopefully, with God on our side, we will make it to the final.” On their chances of retaining the PSL title, Mosimane said the league is in the hands of Pirates. Both teams are left with two games to play. “It won’t be easy for us, but it’s possible,” explained Mosimane. “But even if we don’t win it this season, we will win it next year. At the moment, the league is not in our hands, it’s for Pirates to lose it. But we will keep fighting.” On Leopards win, the 54-year-old coach said: “This team is giving their best despite a tough programme we face. “ There’s no team in the country that has a busy programme like us. It’s humbling for me to see the team play like this. These boys have never been with their families for a while, but we got three points in Venda and it’s unbelievable.” Downs’ goals were scored by Gaston Sirino and Tebogo Langerman, while Tumelo Khutlang netted for the struggling Lidoda Duvha.
