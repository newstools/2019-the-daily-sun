ACTRESS Dineo Rabotapi (23) has scored a double victory on Isithembiso! She won the role of a manipulative Zoleka on the soapie and plays alongside Patrick Ndlovu. Dineo prefers to be called Star. Star said filmmaker Angus Gibson asked her who she would like to see play her uncle, and her immediate answer was Ndlovu. “He was auditioned and he got the role. We connect very well. He guides and helps me get into my character,” said Star. “He taught me that acting is reality. He advised never to show the audience that you’re acting.” Star said her character, Zoleka is the younger sister of the notorious gangster Diamond, and a wild journalism student. “Zoleka is always causing trouble. She vandalises the university’s residential area for a scoop and to get hired at a campus radio station.” Born in Modderfontein, Ekurhuleni, Star started out as a ballet dancer, which led to TV presenting. “I presented Soccer 411 on SABC Sport in 2016 and later fell in love with acting. I did a number of Lokshin Bioskop movies on Mzansi Magic.” Star acted in Damakas, Hands of Time and Nomayini. Star is on the Thesha web series on YouTube and plays Marang (17), an orphan who sells ganja. Star said Marang prepared her to play Zoleka. “I could relate to her and used my loudness and energy to bring her to life.” Star said she has seven tattoos. “One tattoo is dedicated to my superstar father, Gift Rabotapi. I am where I am because of him.”
