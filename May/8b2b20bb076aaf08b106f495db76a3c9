SOME of the most wanted criminals in Gauteng were among the 43 bust in a street operation on Thursday. Provincial police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the operation, commanded by Major-General Daniel Mthombeni from Tshwane and Major-General Fred Kekane of the West Rand led to the arrest of these wanted suspects. “We want to ensure criminals are kept off the streets.” He said three wanted suspects were caught. “The operation was focused mostly on suspects wanted for serious and violent crimes like rape, robbery, hijacking, possession of unlicensed firearms, dealing in drugs and murder.” Makhubele said during the operation, four liquor outlets and eight second-hand dealerships in Tshwane were closed. “Two suspects were arrested for dealing in drugs.” He said West Rand police bust 13 suspects for various offences, including two for hijacking and two for possession of drugs. Nine people were found in possession of gold bearing materials. The arrested suspects will appear in the Krugersdorp and Pretoria magistrates courts soon.
