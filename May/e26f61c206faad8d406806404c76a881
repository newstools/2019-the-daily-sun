Speaking at the EFF's first post-election press conference at the EFF's headquarters in Braamfontein Johannesburg. Malema laid into new political parties who as he explained thought they would rain on the EFF's parade. "This thing is big. Don't undermine it," Malema said. Malema joked that he thinks the African Content Movement leadership was not giving Hlaudi Motsoeneng his "medication when they took him to rallies. You can't entertain Hlaudi. I think he is a Weskoppies case," Malema said.   Malema also laid into the Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party's leader Irvin Jim for what he called wasting of worker's money. He said that the SRWP was acting elitist getting the best of everything. "How can you waste worker's money by hiring luxurious double cab bakkies on elections," Malema said.  Malema called the 2019 Elections the toughest one yet. "1994 was Mickey Mouse," Malema said. He said the places they wish they did better like the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, Northern Cape and Free State. The ANC got their biggest win in the elections in Limpopo, the same province which Malema was deployed to.  Malema said that he was happy with the growth of the Freedom Front Plus. "The growth of the Freedom Front Plus is proof that someone is threatening white privilege. The Freedom Front Plus is seeing growth because white people are in defensive mode," Malema said. https://twitter.com/Mbiizozo/status/1128989397179916289 On Trevor Noah, Malema said that the comedian is free to say anything he wants about him and the EFF. "Despite all the nonsense he said he remains our own. He's a joke. Let's not get angry at jokes," Malema said.  Malema said that President Cyril Ramaphosa can deny it all he likes but there are plans within the ANC to remove him. He said that Ramaphosa performed worse than Jacob Zuma in the elections. "There's a faction working hard to replace him," Malema said.
