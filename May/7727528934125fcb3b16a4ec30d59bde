THEY have been living without clean water for two long years. Residents of Phomolong and Suurman Ridge kasis in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told Daily Sun they were forced to share water with animals. They said they only get water from a dam in the area. Community spokesman Joseph Mashego said tankers sell water, which they can’t afford. “We’re suffering. These tankers are supposed to supply us with water for free but sell it to the community,” said Joseph. He said residents who couldn’t afford to buy water had to fetch it from a muddy dam. This has been happening for a long time. “We can’t compromise our health,” he said. “We don’t want our community and kids to get sick. We need clean water. “We’re sharing water with animals. The water smells bad as kak flows straight into the dam. We deserve better.” Joseph said they reported the matter to the municipality several times but nothing was done. “If they don’t fix the problem in the next week, we’ll protest until our demands are met,” he told the People’s Paper. Acting mayoral spokesman Norman Mohale said residents needed to report the matter to the region 2 offices or contact their councillor.
