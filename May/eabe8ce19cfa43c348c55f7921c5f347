NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality recently started a project to make izinyoka connections a thing of the past. The project has already seen shacks at Ramaphosa squatter camp in Motherwell getting electricity. Residents told Daily Sun illegal connections in the area had left them fearing for their lives. They said izinyoka broke into two electricity boxes in the area and they were constantly making sparks. Nombuleleo Franz (32) said she could finally breathe easy when her kids walked to catch the school bus. “Ndlovu Street was very bad, with live wires everywhere. I’m excited the municipality is busy putting electricity connections in our shacks,” she said. Lundi Mnyama (37), who lived on Ndlovu Street with his family, said there were often blackouts as a result of illegal connections. “I am very happy because illegal connections are dangerous and people can be killed by them. I hope the municipality will speed up connections so squatters don’t have to steal electricity anymore,” he said. Lundi said if squatters paid for electricity, the municipality would have more money to fight crime by putting up street lights. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We are currently doing an electrification programme of shacks and trying other alternatives like non-grid electricity provision. We call on residents to work with us to stop illegal connections.”
