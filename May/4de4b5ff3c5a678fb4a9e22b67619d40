Mpumalanga Social Development MEC Busisiwe Shiba has pleaded with Sassa grant beneficiaries to ensure they protect their personal information. Shiba said they had received numerous complaints of cases where beneficiaries had lost their cards, resulting in their social grants being withdrawn fraudulently. “Beneficiaries must note that no person can withdraw their money without their consent, unless provided with a pin code and the card,” said the MEC. She said people should not give their card or share their pin codes with anyone they didn’t trust. “Those who are accessing their grants at ATMs must ensure they observe their surroundings and move away if they see anything suspicious about the ATM,” she said. “Beneficiaries are warned that if an ATM is obstructed from their view or poorly lit, they should visit another one. “They should never ask for assistance from strangers,” said Shiba. She said Sassa would like to encourage pensioners to get their social grants at the nearest post office.
