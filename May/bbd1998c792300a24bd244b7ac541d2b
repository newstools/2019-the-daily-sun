LIGWALAGWALA FM let midday show host Khaya Matcheque go on Friday. This was after she posted videos on social media, which caused controversy. Management revealed they were left with no choice but to terminate the contract of 32-year-old Khaya with immediate effect. “It is worth noting that this decision is based solely on Khaya’s admission of guilt in a report she wrote to the station’s management. She acknowledges her contravention of her contractual obligation to the SABC,” said the radio station. Khaya apologised in a video. She said her videos were not directed at anyone, and she was not teaching young girls anything. “If you find my videos offensive, I would like to pass my apologies to you and anyone who has been affected by their content. “I would like to stress that I am not teaching any young girls anything on my videos. “My videos are not meant for any girl, woman or anyone,” she said. She posted on her Facebook page: “Thank you for your thoughts and prayers in this difficult time. Your messages of kindness are not in vain, they are helping me keep strong during these trials and tribulations. I’m walking my miles very strong because of you” Her fans have supported her since news broke of her contract being terminated. They threatened to march to the station to demand her reinstatement. Three years ago, Khaya made headlines when she participated in Mzansi Magic’s Date my Family, whereshe made it clear that financial stability was at the top of her list of requirements.
