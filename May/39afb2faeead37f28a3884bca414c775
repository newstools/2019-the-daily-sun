 In his youth whilst still at Kaizer Chiefs, Jabu won the hearts of millions of soccer followers in Mzansi. But a life of boozing, womanising, drugs, fast cars and partying almost destroyed this talented kid from Daveyton. He was even nicknamed “Ngwana wa Tshwenya” (Problem Child) because he would disappear or get to mischief ahead of big games or even Cup Finals. But when he was in possession of the ball, the opposition defenders would be shaking in their boots as “Shuffle” would dish out shibobos, tsamayas on his way to creating or scoring goals.  He was a player for the big occasion. He's now managed to turn his life around and he spends most of his time with his wife and family, or as SuperSport United ambassador, and Soccer Analyst and even as a radio host for Massiv Metro.   When he is not busy with the many business engagements he is involved in, he is always with his kids or doing some campaigning for the ANC in Ekurhuleni ahead of the upcoming elections.
