PROPERTY company LCM Ludidi held a fun run on Saturday to give back to villagers. The 10km and 5km run took place in KwaBhaca, Eastern Cape, in memory of Ledwith Mgudlwa, the first black property developer in the area. Family spokesman and company manager Ndoda Langa said they wanted to keep his memory alive. “To honour the work he did for the community, we needed to do more. We decided to get cash prices and vouchers from sponsors. We need more sponsors to join us to make this bigger.” Ntabengcuka Club chairman Xolile Nyamende said the company spoke to them about the event. “We saw a chance to promote local athletes. “We were not expecting so many people but pulled it off. This competition is meant to promote a healthy lifestyle. “We hope to get a bigger turnout next year.” First prize winner Anele Dlamini said the area needs more races. He won R3 000 in cash for coming first in the 10km race. “I’m in good shape, thanks to my club and coach. The minute I started, I knew the cash prize was mine. I’m doing this for my children.” Winners were given cash, vouchers, certificates and medals. Fees and takings from the event will go to old age centres in Mount Frere.
