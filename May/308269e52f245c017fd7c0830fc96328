 Four people
have died and three are injured. This is
after they inhaled poisonous gases. Netcare 911
spokesman, Shawn Herbst said on Tuesday afternoon, Netcare 911 responded to
reports of an industrial incident in Parow Valley. Reports
from the scene indicated that workers had become trapped in a Dump and waste
collection pit and were suffering the effects of toxic gases. Herbst said
the Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services crews had to use breathing apparatus as
well as set up a rope system to retrieve the patients. “Tragically
on closer assessment by paramedics, it was discovered that four people had
died, another two were in a critical condition and one sustained moderate
injuries. “Once
treated the patients were transported by various ambulance services to hospital
for further treatment,” said Herbst. Circumstances
leading up to the incident are unknown but will be investigated by the relevant
authorities.
