ACCORDING to the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa, the nation should be grateful for the role played by nurses in the fight against HIV. Cassim Lekhoathi, the union’s acting general secretary, said in spite of the challenges nurses face, they are an important part of the world’s biggest ARV programme. In a statement released for International Nurses’ Day on Sunday, he said: “Since nurses underwent ARV management training in 2010, many deaths caused by Aids have been prevented. “People living with HIV are now living longer, working and providing for their families, and are healthier. “The training meant nurses could test and give medication to HIV-positive patients.” However, Lekhoathi said nurses in South Africa still face many difficulties. He said issues like insufficient staff and medication, and equipment shortages at public facilities, led to patients becoming frustrated with nurses. Lekhoathi said the health department’s poor support and low salaries made nursing a very demanding profession. He called on communities to speak out about issues they encountered at public hospitals and said it was very important for clinics to be open 24 hours a day.
