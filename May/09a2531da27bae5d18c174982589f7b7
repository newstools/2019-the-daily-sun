WHEN neighbours broke down the door to free Festus “Mchini” Matshogo from a raging fire, he was a walking ball of flames. After the petrol bombing of the 58-year-old councillor’s house in Mohlakeng, on the West Rand, horrified neighbours saw his skin peeling off. He was immediately rushed to hospital, where he is fighting for his life. His neighbour, Elizabeth Mangwedi, said residents were woken by a powerful explosion in the early hours of Sunday morning. Elizabeth said they could hear him desperately screaming for help. She said when they got outside, they saw the councillor’s house covered in flames. The roof had been completely ripped off and was lying on the street. “He was screaming repeatedly that he was burning. It was as if God was calling him. The wall exploded. That’s when we saw him walking towards us covered in flames,” said Elizabeth. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the cops were still investigating the incident. “While the circumstances around this incident and a motive are yet to be determined, police can confirm that at least three unused petrol bombs were found at the scene,” he said. Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe said: “The unfortunate incident has left the community in rage and misery. The physical condition of the councillor is severe and he is under strict medical supervision. “He is currently in hospital and the municipality will update the matter on receiving a medical report.” The SunTeam tried to speak to the councillor’s family but they did not want to comment.
