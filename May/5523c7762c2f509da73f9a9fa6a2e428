TRADITIONAL healer Sethunya Motaung from Rietgat in North West believes Kaizer Chiefs will never win trophies until Kaizer Motaung himself performs rituals honouring Ewert Nene. “Kaizer Chiefs will not win games and top players will have long-term injuries until Nene’s plea is heard,” said the 67-year-old traditional healer. He said club chairman Kaizer Motaung must pay what is due to Nene’s family. “I’m tired. I can’t be quiet anymore because this is hurting me and has destroyed my ancestral calling,” said Sethunya. “What I want is for the Chiefs boss to listen and do what Nene wants.” He said Nene is using him because he has the same surname as the Chiefs boss. “My indumba is empty because I too have bad luck.” Sethunya said Motaung knows exactly what he must do to make Nene, one of the co-founders of Chiefs in 1970, happy. Sethunya threw his bones in front of the SunTeam and said Chiefs will not be successful until Motaung visits him and they go to Nene’s family to make peace. The traditional healer said he is not related to the Chiefs boss and doesn’t know where the Nene family lives but has been advised by Nene to go with Motaung to the family. “Nene’s punishing Motaung through his team and nothing good will be produced by Chiefs until he listens,” said Sethunya. Chiefs spokesman Vina Maphosa said the matter was far fetched. “I don’t discuss issues related to the chairman. Anyone who is looking for the team’s chairman must call the office number.” Daily Sun sent an email to the Kaizer Chief’s office and Maphosa, who said he will forward the inquiry to the people concerned.
