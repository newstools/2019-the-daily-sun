   Having opened the online applications on the 13th May, the Gauteng Department of Education has confirmed that it has already received 459 608 applications for Grade 1 and 8 for 2020 Admissions. The department has processed a total number of 459 608 applications with 211 584 being for Grade 1’s and 248 024 for grade 8. The department has stressed that parent’s need not panic as the department’s technicians are working tirelessly on rectifying the WA4 reference numbers received by some parents who reside closer to schools, instead of them receiving WA1. The department would like to remind parents to make sure that they have proper documentation after applying online. All proper documentation must be submitted to all schools, within seven working days, after applying. Schools must not force parents to fill-in administrative forms, or require some supporting documents before accepting their documents, during the application period.
