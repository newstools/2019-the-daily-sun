SHOPPERS were left horrified when a woman committed suicide in a mall on Thursday. According to management of Eastgate Mall in Bedfordview, Ekurhuleni, the horrific incident took place just before 2pm. Shoppers who witnessed the woman jump from the second floor of the mall soon started posting on social media. Nicci Christodoulou wrote on Twitter: “I’m so sorry for you and all the kiddies who also saw it. “It’s a terrible thing. I prayed so hard when I saw her lying there. Life is so precious.” Reanetse Makibi wrote: “All I saw was a person in the air and then, boom, on the floor. “It was tragic. I had to run away.” The mall’s management said ER24 paramedics responded to the scene but the woman died from her injuries. As police investigations took place over the weekend, part of the mall was closed to the public. Mmanagement sent its deepest condolences to the woman’s family and apologised to shoppers.
