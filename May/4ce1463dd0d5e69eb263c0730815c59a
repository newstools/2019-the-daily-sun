HE was arrested, charged with rape and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2011. But after spending eight years in jail, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein found Thabo Thebeagae (38) innocent. His two co-accused were each sentenced to 20 years in jail. This was after the three were found guilty of raping a 50-year-old woman in 2007. Thabo, from Phase 10 in Mangaung, Free State, was released from prison last Monday. Now he wants the state to pay for putting him behind bars for no reason. “In 2007, I visited my colleague at his home. When I arrived, I found a woman crying. My colleague and his friend ran away. I was left alone without knowing what had happened and went home. “I was shocked when the police arrested me the following day. I did not argue with them as I knew I was innocent,” said Thabo. “When I went on trial I tried to tell them I was innocent, but it fell on deaf ears.” He lodged an appeal in 2012. “At last they believed I was innocent. But they’ve destroyed my life. I have lost my job and my girlfriend. I never got an opportunity to raise my child and I have a criminal record,” he said. Thabo’s mum, Sina (64), said: “I knew my child was innocent. I am so happy they’ve released him. I always prayed for this day.” NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said Thabo was convicted of rape after compelling evidence was presented to court. “He was prosecuted with two other accused. One of the accused has since died in prison,while the other is still serving his sentence. “Thabo took the matter on appeal and on 20 May his appeal was successful. The appeal court set aside his conviction and sentence. The court found him innocent,” Shuping said.
