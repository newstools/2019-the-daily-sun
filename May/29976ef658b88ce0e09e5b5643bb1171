NO incidents were reported during the Saturday soccer match at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. But three chancers tried to make a quick buck at the match between Kaizer Chiefs and TS Galaxy. They apparently bought tickets and resold them at the gate. Police said the three men’s luck ran out when they were bust. One suspect was found with 49 tickets, the second with 20 tickets, and the third one with two tickets. Soccer fan Mthobisi Cele (28) said although his favourite team Kaizer Chiefs lost the cup 1-0, he was glad the stadium didn’t go up in flames like last year. “The people who bought tickets only to sell them at a profit, and not to watch the match, are selfish,” said a furious Mthobisi. A lot of people really wanted to watch the match, but didn’t get a chance because tickets the were sold out. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the match ended with no incidents. But the KZN cops spokesman confirmed that three suspects were bust for resale of tickets. “The arrested suspects, aged between 46 and 57, will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon,” he told the People’s Paper. He said police presence helped.
