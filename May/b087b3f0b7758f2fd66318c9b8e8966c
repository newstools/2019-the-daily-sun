MPUMALANGA Department of Human Settlements and the national department of human settlements intend to get rid of squatter camps in the province. The informal settlements upgrade programme will provide 2 802 housing units in the 2019/2020 financial year. This was according to the provincial co-ordinator for the upgrade, Buyisiwe Zuma. Zuma was speaking at a two-day workshop for municipal and provincial town planners in Middelburg last week. She said they would take a proactive approach to stop any further development of shacks through the In-Situ initiative. The In-Situ upgrade is a staged process to improve the quality of life of people living in informal settlements, without evicting them. “It involves moving households off the land into a temporary relocation area nearby while dismantling the shacks. “Then the site will have formal housing laid out, allowing the same households to move back in,” she said. Zuma said there were different ways in which shacks could be upgraded. “One of the key approaches of government housing policy is to upgrade informal settlements with community participation. “This includes re-arranging the existing shacks into an orderly layout so that basic services can be introduced.” She said the workshop intended to provide insight into the principles of the In-Situ approach. The department plans to deliver 6 694 housing units and service 5 000 sites during the current financial year at various areas in the province.
