MORE than 100 kids have to stay at home when it rains because their school roof was blown away by a storm last year. Mzongwana Primary School in Ngqeleni, Eastern Cape, was built by parents in Dangwana Village in 1988. They wanted a school close by. But the roof has blown off twice over the past three years and parents had to pay from their own pockets to fix it. Then three classrooms were blown away in November. Parents said they have been asking the department of education to build them a proper school. The school’s not fenced and villagers cross through at any time of day. SGB chairman Pudini Mdlalo said: “We have been raising issues with the department for years, but they keep telling us they are handling it,” he said. “Our children are not safe. With children being kidnapped or raped, we fear the worst. We don’t even have toilets.” Principal Sonny Ngcengce said: “Children cannot study in these conditions.” Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the department needed about R7,1 billion to address the infrastructure backlog, and they only had R1,48 billion. “We invite the private sector to help,” he said.
