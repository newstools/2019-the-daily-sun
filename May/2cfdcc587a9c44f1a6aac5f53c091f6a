RESIDENTS were horrified when a woman was shot and killed in her shack on Monday night. According to residents of Block 8 in Philippi, Cape Town, three men entered 35-year-old Kheleli Jwalane’s shack and fired shots at her before escaping. Community leader Nomawaka Kaleni said: “We’re shocked because it looks as if these people were sent to kill her. We don’t know who did this, but it’s horrible.” Kheleli’s brother, Rethabile Mpo, said as far as he knew, she had no enemies. Kheleli was originally from Bloemfontein in the Free State and worked at a hotel in Claremont. “Why would three men hide in the darkness of the night to kill a woman? That was clearly an act of cowardice,” said Mpo. Nomusa Jim (40) said she hid under her bed after hearing the gunshots. “I didn’t know what was happening. All I thought about was my safety,” she said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the incident was being investigated. He said anyone with information about the killing should contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
