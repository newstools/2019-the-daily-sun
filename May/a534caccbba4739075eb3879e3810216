OUTGOING Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has thanked the members of the law enforcement parade for a job well done during the presidential inauguration in Tshwane on Saturday. He addressed about 1300 members yesterday (Sunday) at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Tshwane where the inauguration was held. He said they have been having sleepless nights when they were planning for this event but he was happy that the members have gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure everything ran smoothly. He said they began working with 2500 police officers from the 8 May leading to Saturday. Cele said he hasn’t heard any complaint from any one.  “The police did not only make sure that that the inauguration was safe but they made sure that all the airports, the freeways was a crime free zone,” he said. He said the reason he came to thank the officers even after he was no longer a minister was because of the job that they have done.  “I saw it befitting that I come and thank them for the sterling job, now I will hand over everything to the Police National Commissioner,” he said. The South African National Commissioner, Kehla Sitole, echoed the minister’s words to the members of the police. He said they worked beautifully in ensuring that everyone was safe. He told the members that they will be rewarded with a two days off in the next coming two weeks. “All the money due to you for working overtime and the allowance will be paid in two weeks’ time. “I will make sure that everyone gets theirs reward and you all get it on time. “I don’t want to hear any of you complain about not being paid,” he said
