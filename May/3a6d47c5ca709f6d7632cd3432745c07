A multiple-vehicle collision left four people dead and at least 23 others injured on the N1 near Grasmere. This tragic accident happened this morning following a multiple-vehicle collision on the N1 Highway between the Grasmere toll plaza and the N12. The ER24 spokesman, Russel Meiring said ER24 personnel, along with several other services, arrived on the scene at 7:33am and found numerous vehicles, including light motor vehicle, trucks and a bus, scattered along the road. Meiring said numerous patients were found either lying between the vehicles or walking around on the scene. Local authorities closed off the highway while emergency personnel began to assess the patients. “Assessments showed that four people had sustained fatal injuries while at least 20 others had sustained injuries ranging from minor to critical. The patients were treated for their injuries, and the critically injured provided with advanced life support interventions, before they were transported by various services to nearby hospitals,” said Meiring. “It is believed that smoke from a nearby grass-fire played a contributing factor in the cause of the collision. Local authorities will be investigating further,” he added.
