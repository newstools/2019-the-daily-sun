“We are back with a great deal of vuma.” That was President Cyril Ramaphosa speaking at the ANC #PhakamaRamaphosa rally at Luthuli House in Joburg on Sunday.  We are here to celebrate with humility,” Ramaphosa said.  Ramaphosa thanked supporters for investing confidence in the ANC again. He said that these elections were the most difficult campaign.  “Whether they like it or not we won. Others went and consulted sangamos but we were victorious in the end,” Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa said that Gauteng was their biggest challenge.  “It doesn’t matter how we got here but we are here. We got the one that they wanted the most,” he said.  Ramaphosa thanked Limpopo for giving the ANC the biggest win in the country.  The President elect thanked young people who came out to vote, especially the first time voters.  “We had 48 parties ganged up against us but we showed them who’s the boss.  We’ve heard our people. They gave us a clear message."
