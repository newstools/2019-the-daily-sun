PARENTS of pupils at Lethabong Secondary School in KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, are fed up with the school they say poses a safety threat. They said the department must fix the school or close it before something bad happens. Last month Daily Sun published a story about the school toilets that don’t work. “Our children are at risk from ceilings in their classrooms hanging down,” said a parent. “The floors in most classrooms are full of holes and windows are broken.” A grade 12 pupil said the school is no longer fit for human occupation. “Windowpanes are broken, and when it rains our books get wet,” he said. “Winter is here and we’re going to freeze.” A parent said: “We want an urgent meeting with the SGB to discuss the situation. “We came up with a plan to fix the toilets. We asked the principal to request every child to donate R2 so we could fix the leaking toilet pipes. “The money was paid by almost all the kids but disappeared.” Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department will send a school infrastructure team to assess the situation.
