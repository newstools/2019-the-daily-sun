PARLIAMENT always has Mzansi in stitches. National Assembly deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli and the EFF’s Makoti Khawula have been entertaining people. With government making changes in the National Assembly, SunLand has called for Tsenoli and Khawula to remain. They also revealed the names of those they want back in parliament, such as Julius Malema, Willie Madisha and Mangosuthu Buthelezi. But Tshenoli and Khawula have captured the people’s hearts. Videos of the two debating have made the rounds on social media. In one of the videos, Tsenoli loses his patience with EFF members and says: “Uyabona ke, manje seniyedelela!” (You see now, you’re being disrespectful). But the EFF didn’t take it lying down and asked him to withdraw his statement. Social media users started a petition for Tshenoli and Khawula to stay in parliament.
