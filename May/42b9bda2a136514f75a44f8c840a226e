CRIME is fast becoming a big headache in Vhembe, especially in Thohoyandou. Not a week goes by without a shocking incident being reported in the area. Three weeks ago, a local pastor’s wife was attacked and killed by intruders in Thohoyandou block G in what people though was a robbery. And on Monday, residents of Mvudi Park in Muledane had a rude awakening. A woman was stabbed and killed while the other two people in the house were injured during a robbery. The three women, who were renting the house while setting up a business at Thavhani Mall, were attacked by two armed suspects at about 4am in the morning. All three were stabbed. A 23-year-old woman was killed instantly and the two others were taken to hospital in a serious condition. The suspects were apparently armed with a gun and knives. They robbed the victims of their belongings, which they took in bags. This has shocked residents, who now are pleading with the municipality to build a wall to stop free movement in the area. A local community leader said crime is at an all-time high in the area and residents no longer have any peace. He said: “Criminals are ruling here. “They are making our lives very miserable and we are left helpless. “One particularly bad day, we woke up with more than five homes broken into. “We are asking our municipality to help us build a wall that will stop thugs from doing as they please.” He said they tried blocking the shortcut to the area with big rocks but that didn’t work either. The suspects are still unknown and police investigations are continuing. Police have confirmed the incident and Limpopo cop spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they have launched a hunt for the killers. He said: “Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects should call the nearest police station or Captain Tshililo Sithata on 082 414 7763, CrimeStop on 08600 10111 or SMS 32211.”
