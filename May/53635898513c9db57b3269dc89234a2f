A PIG farmer was left in tears yesterday over 25 of his dogs were poisoned. Farmer Chithibunga Nobhadula from Motherwell NU9, Port Elizabeth, was devastated as he picked up the dogs’ carcasses. He told Daily Sun he believed the dogs were killed because one of them attacked a neighbour’s goat. “On 30 March, I was at a funeral in Alice when I received a call from my neighbour’s brother saying my dogs bit his goats. “I told my son to give the man some of my goats for his brother, but he slaughtered them. “The next day my son told me the neighbour’s goats were not well looked after and came on my farm. One of the goats was bitten on the thigh but not seriously hurt. “Two days later he came and told me my dog had damaged his stock. After I said they came on my farm, he threatened me and left.” Chithibunga said he didn’t take the neighbour’s threats seriously, but last Sunday his dogs started dying. “I had about 50 dogs, and so far I have found 25 dead all over the farm. They look like they were poisoned,” he said. “I want the SPCA to take the remaining dogs because I can’t watch them die like this.” Chithibunga said he will lay charges against his neighbour. The SunTeam tried to contact the neighbour, with no success. Inspector Beverly Rademeyer of the Animal Anti Cruelty League said: “The dog owner should take his dogs to the vet for an autopsy to be done.”
