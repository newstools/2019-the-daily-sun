MASKANDI singer Mthandeni Manqele has apologised for storming into the #Gcwalisa IMabhida Maskandi festival in March. Mthandeni caused chaos when he unexpectedly pitched at the stadium in Durban, leading to maskandi fans assaulting him. In a bid to avoid harsh censure by the House of Traditional Leaders on Friday, Mthandeni humbled himself and apologised. The leaders had summoned him to explain the title of his album, Dog Style. He was instructed to explain why he went to #Gcwalisa IMabhida without being invited. He’s now waiting for the verdict. At the meeting, Mthandeni apparently insisted he didn’t mean a sex position when he titled his album. He apologised for wrongdoing, if any, begging amakhosi not to punish him. House chairman Thulani Nkwanyana said amakhosi would set a date to discuss his case and decide.
