FORMER president Jacob Zuma has lashed out at government for forgetting struggle veterans. He was speaking at the hand over of a seven-roomed house to ANC veteran Amos Ndwalane (70) in Lamontville, Durban, on Friday. Zuma was accompanied by ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. He said he had asked many ministers and MECs to build houses for veterans but the only person who responded was KZN Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo. “We must not forget the people who brought us to where we are now. I’m sad that these days no one is talking about Ndwalane and other struggle veterans. “We must not act as if they are dead when they are still with us,” said Zuma. Magashule said the ANC should always be grateful to people such as Ndwalane because they had contributed to the freedom South Africans enjoyed. Just days before the election, the NFP was dealt a blow as another top leader left the party. Former secretary general Nhlanhla Khubisa was among ex-NFP members who were welcomed at an ANC in Tongaat on Saturday. Khubisa was the party’s chief whip in parliament.
