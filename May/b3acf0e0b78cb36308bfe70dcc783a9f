MAMELODI Sundowns have moved to the top of the Absa Premiership with a decisive 2-0 victory over Golden Arrows at Loftus Stadium on Tuesday. But a cloud of uncertainty hovers over their title race with Orlando Pirates. This is in light of the PSLâ€™s decision to appeal the League DC sanction in the Sundowns/Wayne Arendse matter. To recap, Sundowns were found guilty of fielding Arendse, who was ineligible in their league fixture against Bidvest Wits in October. They were then ordered to pay a fine of R250 000 and not docked any points. Sundowns are now top with 56 points two more than the Buccaneers, thanks to quick-fire goals from Hlompho Kekana and Themba Zwane, with the last round of matches to go this season. But the latest move could throw the spanner in the works as the PSL wants a tougher sanction meted out to the Brazilians... calling for Wits to be awarded a 3-0 victory. This would set Sundowns back in the race Bucs would be back on top.Knocked out of the Caf Champions League, Sundowns had no time to wallow in misery as they shifted focus back on the league.And they barely raised a sweat against Arrows, who were there for the taking. It is going to be interesting!
