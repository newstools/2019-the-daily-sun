COMMUNITIES in Mpumalanga have been urged to be vigilant during this season and not to start unnecessary fires. Working on Fire spokeswoman Amanda Mthembu  said 24 teams made up of 480 firefighters are gearing up for a winter campaign aimed at putting out fires. She said firefighters had already visited schools and communities to raise awareness about the dangers of runaway fires. “We urge landowners in particular to get in touch with us so we can assist with the development of clear integrated fire management services,” she told the People’s Paper. Mthembu asked people to remove unnecessary rubble that could easily catch fire. She asked residents living near grasslands to ensure sufficient fire breaks between their properties and grasslands. Working on Fire is now in its 15th year.  Its firefighters attend to an average of 2 500 wildfires a year. Its team stopped a blaze in the Camden Power Station area in June last year.
