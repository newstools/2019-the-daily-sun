THE cost of a funeral in the villages has prompted these family members to form a family burial society. The Novela Burial Society was established by 10 members, seven years ago in Makuleke Village, outside Malamulele, Limpopo. Now, the group has 70 members. Each member contributes R70 which goes into a savings account. Eddy Novela, one of the members, said: “To fight high funeral costs, we started our own burial society and so far the plan is working perfectly well. According to Eddy, back then family members only contributed R20, which was too little to cover funeral costs. “So we started the Novela Burial Society,” he said. Rebecca Novela, another member, added: “Savings from monthly contributions yield enough cash for funeral costs.” A R3 000 payout is made in case a family member’s death. This includes a mother, father, brother or sister. And R5 000 is paid out to the family in case of a member’s death.” Rebecca said an additional R15 is contributed monthly for food and drinks to entertain members.
