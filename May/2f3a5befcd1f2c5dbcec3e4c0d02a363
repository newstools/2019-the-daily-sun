ORLANDO Pirates star Ben Motshwari believes they only have themselves to blame for potentially blowing their title chances. Bucs have handed the advantage to contenders Mamelodi Sundowns in the fierce title race. They were held to a 2-2 draw by Cape Town City at Athlone Stadium on Saturday, a major setback in their pursuit of their first title in seven years. City flew out of the blocks as Zukile Kewuti put them ahead 20 second into the game.However, Thembinkosi Lorch equalised before Luvuyo Memela put Bucs in the lead. City winger Craig Martin, though, had other ideas as he leveled matters late to leave Bucs reeling. Bucs are now just a single point ahead of second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns who have a game in hand. Motshwari, who is hoping to bag his second Absa Premiership title having won it with Bidvest Wits in 2016, was disappointed by the result. "I don’t know what to say,” Motshwari told Supersport TV after the match. “We conceded an early goal once again. Last minute we lose concentration in such a crucial game. I'm lost for words. “We should never have conceded such a goal. It was a lack of concentration in the dying minutes of the game. Like I said that was an easy goal to concede. I'm disappointed. I think as a club you know we did this to ourselves. The star, who was named man of the match, has not lost hope just yet though and is hoping Golden Arrows do them a favour when the lock horns with Downs on Tuesday. "We can't give up, we have to soldier on. We'll take this point and hopefully it will mean something at the end of the season," he added.
