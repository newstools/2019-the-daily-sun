IT WAS meant to be a peaceful meeting about electricity. But things got ugly as residents became violent. Residents of Atteridgeville, Tshwane, blocked roads with rocks and logs on Friday. They were promised a municipal official would address them on Monday and the situation went back to normal. But on Monday police said at least 4 000 residents of the Jeffsville and Phomolong squatter camps marched to demand they be addressed by the infrastructure MMC. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said protesters started getting impatient and violent when they realised the MMC wasn’t coming. “The protesters started to be unruly and threw stones and bottles at the police,” he told Daily Sun. Makhubele said public order police warned the crowd to calm down. “The crowd continued throwing stones at the police and broke the municipal fence. “They forcibly entered municipal offices, burned them, and damaged 16 municipal vehicles.”. He said two councillors were among seven people arrested for public violence. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela condemned the violence. Makhubele said the suspects would appear in court soon.
