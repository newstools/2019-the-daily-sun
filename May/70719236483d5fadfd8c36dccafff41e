FOR years they worked hard to save money for their dad’s tombstone! But all their hard work has been reduced to rubble. The Mathes visited the grave at Kgabalatsane Cemetery in Ga-Rankuwa View, Tshwane, last week and found it had been vandalised. Motsei Mathe (47), the daughter of the late Tommy Nkutu, said they were heartbroken after discovering the tombstone had been stolen and the grave damaged. “It was so bad I wasn’t even sure if it was my father’s grave,” Motsei told Daily Sun. “It was hard to put the money together, and now it’s all gone.” Motsei said all they wanted to do was to honour their dad and make sure his resting place was clean. “Now my father will never find peace,” she said. Motsei said after discovering the grave had been vandalised, the family approached the cemetery caretakers. “They told us it was not their problem the tombstone was stolen,” said Motsei. Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi advised the family to report the incident to a cop shop.
