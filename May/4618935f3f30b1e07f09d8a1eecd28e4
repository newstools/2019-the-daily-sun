WHEN contractors arrived with crushed stones to fix their gravel road, villagers in Mndini were quite relieved. But nothing else has happened, more than a year later. Disappointed residents of the village in KwaBhaca told Daily Sun they hoped their cars would finally be safe from the huge potholes on their gravel road. But the gravel stones have been lying untouched on the road since January last year. Villager Mthuthuzeli Zililo said: “We have been to the municipality and they know about this.” He said the villagers were not told why the construction project was stopped. “People can’t go to clinics when it rains. The municipality never gives us satisfactory answers.” Another resident, Zelpha Mbixane, said sometimes she has to drive off the road in her bakkie to get home. “My car has dents all over it. It’s especially bad when it’s raining,” she said. Bonisile Mathontsi of the Mandileni Royal House said: “We only found out about this after the stones were delivered. People come to us for answers but the municipality fails to engage us.” Umzimvubu municipal spokeswoman Nokhanyo Zembe said the delay was caused by a contractor’s grader breaking down. “The contractor will return to the site over the coming weekend and start work on Monday,” she said. She said the contractor would be penalised for not following the contract signed with the municipality.
