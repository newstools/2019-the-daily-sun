WHEN Roshnee Secondary School pupils took the long way home on Monday, an unknown man attacked them. The four pupils were raped, while one was kidnapped and repeatedly raped before being released the next day. Now Vaal residents are angry. They searched for the alleged rapist, who was seen entering a house in De Deur. But all they found was overgrown grass, broken windows and a rundown building. The residents vandalised the house in frustration. Cops appealed to locals to help find the man. Sibusiso Songiwe (35) told Daily Sun they were tired of thugs who hid at unused plots. “There are several plots with old houses used as crime dens. No one knows the owners. “We’ll find this man and make sure justice is served. We’re not going to rest until we find him. We hope he’s skipped the country.” Zimbali Mthombeni (49) said all they wanted was justice for the families. “We hope cops do their job and arrest the rapist,” she said. The mum of one of the victims said they were devastated.“These kids are traumatised. They can’t even eat. We plead with cops to put this monster behind bars.” Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said cases of rape were opened at De Deur Police Station. “We are investigating four cases of rape but no one has been arrested. We appeal to residents to help us with information on the suspect’s whereabouts,” he said.
