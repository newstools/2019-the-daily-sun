JOZI FM staff remembered their late fellow DJ, Mandla Hlatshwayo. They laid flowers at Meli Lounge in Pimville, Soweto, yesterday. Mandla was shot at the venue two years ago and the flowers were laid at the exact spot where he died. There was a big banner with Mandla’s photo on it. Pimville residents stopped and took photos. The DJ and actor was trying to help a woman who was being robbed when he was shot. It was reported four armed men entered the pub and tried to rob two women. His family told Daily Sun they were happy Mandla’s memory lived on. But they were still battling to accept he’s no more. “Mandla was not just a brother but our pillar of strength,” said his younger brother Lucky. He said he wanted to see his brother’s killers locked up. He said the suspects were bust but released due to lack of evidence. Lucky said Mandla loved and cared for women. The stations’s CEO, Mpho Mhlongo, said Mandla was a hero. “Like a solder, he died defending someone.” He said Mandla left a legacy. “If a man like him died for what he did, it means it’s possible for us as men to fight for the rights of women,” she said. “We can’t just fold our arms and keep quiet when there’s a man who showed us what should be done.” He said they were disappointed in the justice system. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun that investigations were continuing.
