BECAUSE of her ancestral calling she had to miss some school and when she came back the teachers allegedly chased her away. Today she is lying in hospital after trying to take her own life. Grade 12 pupil Nosisekelo Gumede (19) from Zamakahle High School at Adams Mission, KZN fell ill in March because she had to accept her calling to be a sangoma. When she returned in April she was told her name was no longer on the school register. Nosisekelo’s cousin, Nobuhle Ncube (26), said Nosisekelo didn’t take the news well and two weeks ago she tried to kill herself. She took an overdose of pain tablets. She was taken to hospital and her life was saved. “Nosisekelo lives with our grandparents who are both sick. She had no one to go to school to take care of the problem,” said Nobuhle. “She felt as if her dream of finishing grade 12 and becoming a lawyer was ruined.” “Being chased from school is destroying her. And she won’t be accepted by any other school at this time of the year,” said Nobuhle. Department of Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they weren’t aware of the matter.
