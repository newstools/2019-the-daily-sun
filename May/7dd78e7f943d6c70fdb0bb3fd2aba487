FUMING parents of 128 pupils are demanding answers from the Mpumalanga Department of Education. This after their children were admitted to hospital last Wednesday. The pupils allegedly got sick after drinking milk supplied by feeding scheme contractors. The grade 4 and 7 pupils from Ndimande Primary School in Merry Pebble Stream Village, outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga were rushed to various clinics, as well as Mapulaneng Hospital. The pupils allegedly started complaining of stomach cramps and vomiting. Angry mum Thembi Nyembe (28) said she was at work when she received a call. “We send our kids to learn, not to die due to the department’s corruption, which gives tenders to people who don’t care about the health of our kids,” said Thembi. She said the department should send inspectors to check the food first. “This must be a wake-up call. We had to camp at the school waiting for our children to come back from hospital.” Mpumalanga Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they were investigating the incident. “All pupils were treated and discharged. “The department is monitoring the developments and will offer the required counselling to families.”
