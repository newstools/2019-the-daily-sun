THE supermarket for fake documents was like no other. The little shop in the Joburg CBD could make everything from passports to drivers’ licences. But yesterday, the owners’ luck ran out when Metro cops pounced and closed its doors. When the SunTeam visited it during the raid, number plates and fake passports were being made. Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said officers acting on a tipoff bust four suspects and charged them with fraud. “They received tipoffs about the shop and went to purchase a permit for R300 before making the bust.” “Documents like IDs were sold for R300, while others like change of ownership certificates for vehicles went for R1 500. “These are services you have to go to the government departments for, but they were doing them in a very short period of time.” Minnaar praised the Metro cops, saying they made a number of arrests in the city recently. “These young men and women are working tirelessly and doing a very good job in reducing crime,” he said. Meanwhile, the new unit of 80 Metro cops created to deal with crime picked up by CCTV cameras has made 42 arrests.
