A FAMILY from Molweni in Durban rejoiced when they got an RDP house in the early 90s. What they didn’t know, though, was that their joy would be shortlived and soon they would start to suffer. Their RDP house was built on land that once had a stream underneath it, and now water keeps seeping up from underneath the house. All of a sudden their yard becomes muddy and slippery, and the water damages their furniture.also gets damaged. Scelo Dlamini (32), said when they got the RDP house in 1995 they extended it using their money. But now they feel that their money has gone down the drain. “The problem began in 2003 when we suddenly saw water emerging from the ground. We thought it was because it had just rained,” Scelo said. “But the water kept oozing out and started creating mud in the yard. We thought it will eventually disappear when the sun comes out but it never did. “When the problem continued we went to the councillor to ask him to assist us and he promised to intervene.” He said they have been waiting for the councillor’s help ever since. For years now, as the wait continues, they have had they’ve been forced to place concrete blocks on the muddy ground so they can walk in and out of the yard. “All these years we hoped the councillor would help us, but the only thing we got from him were empty promises.” He said if they’d known this was going to happen they wouldn’t have agreed to accepted take the RDP house. “We don’t understand why they built houses where there were streams. Now it’s too late as the house in Clermont where we were living was sold and we can’t buy it back. The councillor must speak to the municipality so they can move us to a better place.” said Scelo. Councillor Siphiwe Mncube said he wasn’t  he’s not too sure if he knew had been to the house in question but said there were many lots of  families with similar problems. He said the department of housing was putting negotiating a plan together to move people to another area.
