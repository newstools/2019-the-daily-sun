Mpumalanga police in Acornhoek have launched a hunt for a group of thugs who bombed a cash-in-transit vehicle. They also attacked petrol stations in Casteel and Belfast villages. The vehicle bombing happened on Thursday on the R40 road between Acornhoek and Bushbuckridge. A group of armed thugs bombed a G4s money truck and fled the scene with the cash. Christmas came early for villagers who helped themselves to left-over cash at the scene. At Belfast Village, outside Kruger National Park, near Mkhuhlu, 15 armed suspects bombed the safe in a petrol station on Friday morning. A petrol attendant told police the suspects damaged the wall and gained entry through the door of the garage shop. The attendant said the thugs then took employees outside the garage building and assaulted them. After that they blew up the cash safe with explosives and fled with the money. Acornhoek police spokeswoman Captain Mpho Nonyane said investigations are under way but no arrests have been made yet. Anyone with information should contact Lieutenant-Colonel Dudu Shabangu on 082 4692 569.
