THE SACP is calling on the KZN premier-elect Sihle Zikalala to set up a state capture commission. It wants the provincial government and municipalities probed. Provincial secretary Themba Mthembu said even the R250 million allocated for the drought disappeared before it could reach his department’s account. Mthembu is the MEC for Agriculture in KZN. He said the burning of eThekwini municipal water tankers was allegedly deliberate. He said the SACP has heard that officials working with private companies had deliberately cut the water supply in Ugu and Ndwedwe municipalities. ANC provincial spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said at last week’s legkotla it was agreed that the water and sanitation issue must be probed. She didn’t think a state capture commission was necessary.
