ESIKHALENI has been a no go area since Friday. Residents of the northern KZN kasi have vowed to make the area ungovernable until construction companies hire them. They’ve called on the Umhlathuze Municipality to make sure their demands are met. Protest leader Chicco Langa said most companies hire people from outside. “We have a high number of unemployed people in the area. We can’t have people coming here and taking jobs.” Municipal spokesman Mdu Ncalane said protesters did not hand over an memorandum of demands. They said their taps had been dry for several months. Thulile Mabika (43) said: “How can we live without water when it’s a basic need?” Umkhanyakude municipal spokesman Mdu Dlamini said illegal connections were causing water supply problems. “We supply the area with water, but people make illegal connections so they can get water into their homes. This leads to water cuts.” Dlamini said municipal officials had met residents and warned them the problem was caused by illegal connections. He said water tankers were being sent to areas experiencing problems.
