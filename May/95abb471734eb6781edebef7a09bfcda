PRIMARY school pupils in 2018 Idols SA winner Yanga Sobetwa’s home town made their parents glow and teachers proud. This was after the school, Gateway Primary in Delft, Cape Town, won an inter-primary school choir competition at Abedare Primary School on Saturday. Proud principal Mlindeli Ngqobane could not hide his joy after the school was announced the winner of the competition. He said his pupils showed a lot of promise and potential. “We’re proud of our kids for this achievement,” said Ngqobane. His wish is to see children in the kasi follow in Yanga’s footsteps. “We want the best for our children. This is why we coach them to sing from a young age. “Our desire is to see them on shows like Idols SA. From there they can follow their own individual musical journeys,” said Ngqobane. Music teacher Malibongwe Gaduna said: “I enjoy seeing young kids singing so well at such a tender age. I would like to believe they have the potential to develop into great musicians,” he said. One of the pupils, Buhle Ntozini, (13) said: “I was happy we won. I like singing and wish to be a singer when I grow up. Zahara is my role model.”
