CHAOS erupted inside a school as a fight ensued Mzuvele
High School in KwaMashu north of Durban. This is after about ten boys allegedly entered the
Mzuvele High School through the fence and fought with pupils from the school. This resulted into one boy sustaining stab wounds
while others sustained minor injuries. It is alleged that one of the pupils from the school
was beaten by seven of his school mates during break time ON Thursday, after
they accused him of stealing a bag. Seemingly after he was beaten, he went out of the
school and called his friends to beat his school mates. One of the pupils (17) who asked not to be named told Daily Sun that when the ten boys entered
the school premises chaos erupted. “I was in my classroom when I heard other pupils
screaming and I saw others running in different directions. “I went to see, and the boys were fighting with pupils
from our school, they were waving knives at each other,” said the pupil. The pupil said some of the boys escaped and then the pupils
held one of the boys and they beat him up. “The boy was stabbed, teachers then intervened and
took the boy who was bleeding into one of the classrooms,” the pupil said. Another pupil (15) said then cops were called to the
school to calm the situation down. “The teachers then told us to go home. They were also
terrified after the incident,” said the pupil. The Department of Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi
said it is wrong for pupils to take the law into their own hands. “They should report such matters to the teachers to
prevent fights and stabbings,” Mahlambi said. The KZN police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele
confirmed that a 16-year-old boy was stabbed on the right shoulder after an
argument.
