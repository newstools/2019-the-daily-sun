HE went to an EFF rally in Durban last Tuesday but never came back! Siphiwe Ncube (24) from Otimati in Maphumalo, northern KZN, is slightly mentally disturbed. His family is worried about his safety. Relative Themba Cele (58) said after arriving in Durban Siphiwe apparently got off the bus, saying he wanted to cool off at the beach. “That’s when they last saw him,” he said. “When they came back they noticed he wasn’t among them.” During the day they kept hoping Siphiwe was going to show up but he didn’t. So they boarded the bus without him. “We don’t know where to look for him,” said Themba. “We went to the cops and lifeguards to ask questions. “The lifeguards said there was no drowning on the day Siphiwe went missing. “That’s when we went to the cop shop to open a case.” Cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A missing person’s case is being investigated by Durban Central police.”
