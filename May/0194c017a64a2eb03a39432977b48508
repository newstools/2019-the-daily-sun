FOR three years Nelson Mandela Bay won the prize for the cleanest municipality in the country. But in the past few months, it has become a pigsty. Residents told Daily Sun the closure of a dumping site between Young Park and Algoa Park had caused huge problems for them. They said Missionvale and Govan Mbeki kasi had become dirty as people continued to dump rubbish in an open field. Mamgwevu Ngalo (62) from Govan Mbeki said: “Every day I have to bear the smell of dead dogs and other rotten stuff.” Sindile Stuurman (58) said the smell of rubbish is bad. “Rubbish is blown by the wind into our homes. “We sometimes find dead dogs near the road. Rubbish ruins our lives. “What’s even worse is that municipal officials, who often drive on Old Uitenhage Road, see what’s going on and do nothing.” Marta Willem (56) said their kids sometimes play in the rubbish. “This needs to stop. We can’t live like this. The municipality must help to resolve this matter,” said Marta. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Waste management has been informed of these incidents and rangers will be sent to the area so the culprits can be caught in the act and fined.”
