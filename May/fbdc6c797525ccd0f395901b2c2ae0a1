LAMONTVILLE Golden Arrows were crowned 2018-19 MultiChoice Diski Shield champions after defeating Mamelodi Sundowns 2-1 in the final at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium yesterday. The two time MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) champions have added the Diski Shield to their impressive cabinet, succeeding outgoing champions Kaizer Chiefs. Arrows, who are the only team to have won both the MDC and the Diski Shield, highlighted their status as the best reserve team in the country. Abafana Bes’thende mentor, Vusi Vilakazi was pleased to get sweet revenge over Downs who knocked them out in the semi-finals last season. “We are happy to win the title this season, it’s nice that we did it against Sundowns,” said Vilakazi. The Downs reserve team could not emulate their senior team that won a record ninth Absa Premiership title a day earlier. They were playing in their second consecutive final, but will have to wait another season to clinch their maiden Diski Shield title. Khomotjo Rachoene put Downs in the lead as early as the third minute before Arrows equalised through Siboniso Conco, just five minute later. Conco, though, was not going to be denied the title as he popped up to score the winner from the penalty spot in the 90th minute to break Downs’ hearts. The winners, Arrows walked away with a R150 000 cheque while Downs received R70 000 to donate to a community initiative. Felix Noge’s brace was enough to earn the young Matsatsantsa a third place finish in this season’s MultiChoice Diski Shield.
