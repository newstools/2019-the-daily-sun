Three shacks were broken down in Zwelihle, Hermanus in an apparent post-election quarrel, police said on Saturday. Brigadier Donovan Heilbron said police went to investigate immediately and are hoping to get parties to talk it out. His understanding at present is that it was over people who were accused of not voting for a particular party. "But at this stage it is difficult to tell," he said. The shacks were in the Marikana section of Zwelihle. Last year saw uprisings in the area after a large group of people started pegging out plots of land for themselves, with the intention of building their own houses. They asked the Overstrand Municipality to supply utility lines. Instead, evictions and unrest followed. One of those arrested was former EFF member Gcobani Ndzongana who became the leader of the hastily formed Land Party which contested the elections held this week. It came 12th in Western Cape with 5347 votes and in Overstrand where Hermanus is situated, it came third with 4624 votes.Â The DA led there with 25274, followed by the ANC second at 8820. The EFF got 619 votes in Overstrand, based on preliminary results. The official outcome of the elections is expected to be declared tonight.
