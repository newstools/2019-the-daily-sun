WILLIAM Mawete loves reading, especially sports stories. And because the 25-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, loves Daily Sun stories so much, he keeps those he loves the most. He pastes them on the walls of his room for everyone to see. William proudly showed the SunTeam his Daily Sun wall of fame. “The stories are everywhere inmy house. I enjoy nothing more than seeing them when I open my eyes.” William said he likes the stories written by sports editor Matthews Mpete and his deputy, Kgomotso Mokoena. “I love the way they write. They motivate me. “And because I read these stories, I’ve become a better person. I now can write and read fluently.” William also writes poems and plays. “I’m so grateful. The paper must carry on doing the great work it’s doing.” “I’ve been pasting articles I like on the wall since 2015. “I want my kids to grow up reading these stories. Surely, they will also be inspired.”
