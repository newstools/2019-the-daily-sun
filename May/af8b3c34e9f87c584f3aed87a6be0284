NURSES at a new clinic in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, have been urged to follow in the footsteps of Cecilia Makiwane, the first black nurse in Mzansi. The clinic was officially opened by Premier Refilwe Mtshweni and Health MEC Sasekani Manzini on Friday. “My office receives complaints daily about the quality of treatment from nurses,” said Mtshweni. “We know the majority of our healthcare workers are driven by compassion and love for their work.” Mtshweni said Makiwane lived, walked and breathed the Batho Pele principle as far back as 1908. Mtshweni said Makiwane provided healthcare with compassion and professionalism because she knew that people were the nation’s most important asset. “We therefore call on that tiny minority that has a tendency of not caring for our people to think of the oath they took the day they became healthcare workers,” she told the People’s Paper. Mtshweni encouraged patients to report ill-treatment at the hands of nurses. Goromane Clinic, previously a mobile clinic that opened twice a week and treated about 360 patients a month, will now be open eight hours a day, five days a week.  The new clinic will be manned by five professional nurses. “We urge healthcare professionals who’re already appointed to serve at this institution, as well as those that are yet to be appointed, to conduct their work in line with the Batho Pele principles,” she said.
