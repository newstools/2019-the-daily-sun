MALCOLM X, also known as ‘Business’ has done it again. Social Media users have applauded the businessman for doing what he does best, blessing people. On Saturday during President Cyril Ramaphosa’s inauguration, Malcolm handed out R10,000 to women lying on the grass as part of a Domba Dance (Python Dance). The dance required several women to lie down on the field at the inauguration until they were given money to rise. Malcolm said when he heard an announcement that someone must donate to the women he volunteered. “I raised my hand from the VIP stands, and loudly said. “Thuma Mina” (Send me) Mrs Baleka Mbete invited me to the lawn, and I was escorted to the women, and I did what I’m familiar with, donating money,” he said. He said he wanted to donate more. “I wanted to donate another R10 000,00 to the dancing men who were part of the women’s group, but I quickly remembered that their culture only requires money to be donated to the women who were laying on the ground only,” he said He slammed those who had not donated to the women, claiming they were "eating their nails, picking their noses and squeezing their pimples" while he went to work. "I wouldn’t let those women spend another minute in the scorching sun while rich men were eating their nails, picking their noses and squeezing their pimples instead of donating some cash,” he said He said he has received two invites to Makhado and Thohoyandou in Venda where similar dances will be held. Social Media users said they were proud of him. Mr_Khos wrote: “I can proudly say you are my brother’s keeper, please don’t allow any devil of haters to stand on your way.
