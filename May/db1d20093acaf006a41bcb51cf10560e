Rape
incidents have hit hard on various villages and towns in the Eastern Cape. Gogos aged
between the ages of 70 and 95 years are also targets. This has
been revealed by the South African Police Service management in the Eastern
Cape Province. The cops
said they were shocked and concerned about the increasing levels of rape
incidents in the province. The
Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga said the situation
needed urgent intervention. She said
she was also concerned about social intervention measures such as emotional and
health conditions of those affected by these crimes. Areas most
affected included Lusikisiki, Mthatha, Ngqeleni, East London and Mbizana. “Although
other areas are not immune from this pandemic, they are however a cause for concern
as young and old people are affected by this problem. Crime analysis and trends
indicate that young children up to the age of 18, fall victim of rape either at
home or in the taverns. Saddening, is
the fact that the culprits do not only end with young people, but are also
targeting the elderly women,” said the cops. According
to the cops most of these crimes take place behind closed doors as well as
during nighttime. “This poses
serious challenges for police investigations as some of the suspects manage to
conceal their identities and disappear without trace. Such situations leave the
victims severely traumatised and desperate for help,” said the cops. The police
management said it will be calling for an urgent engagement session among the
stakeholders in the Justice Crime Prevention and Security Cluster to find a
lasting mechanism in dealing with this. Ntshinga
said: “I wish to emphasise that parents have their parental duty to ensure that
young children are not left to travel long distances alone from school without
a caregiver. Equally, elderly women are not left to fend for themselves in
isolation of their homes without any proper guardians.”
