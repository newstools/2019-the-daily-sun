THOUSANDS of Mzansi social media active employees block or decline friend requests from the bosses. According to a recently published Global Privacy Report from Kaspersky Lab, one in two or about 59% workers choose to hide social media activity from their boss. The Kaspersky Lab report states that this secretive stance at work also extends to colleagues. “The average employee spends an astonishing 13 years and two months at work during their lifetime. Interestingly though, not all this time is directly related to solving work tasks or earning a promotion: almost two thirds 64% of consumers admit visiting non-work-related websites every day from their desk,” the report says. About 29% of employees are against their employer knowing which websites they visit.  However, more interestingly, one-in-two 52% are even against their colleagues knowing about their online activities. The report states that this means colleagues constitute an even greater threat to future perspectives of an office slouch or maybe the relationships with colleagues are more informal and therefore, more valuable. “On the contrary, social media activity appears to be a less private domain for many and therefore, more suitable for sharing with colleagues but not the boss. This is probably because workers fear harming the public image of a company or interest in decreased staff productivity motivates companies to monitor employees’ social networks and make career-changing decisions based on that,” it further states. 59% of people say they don’t want to reveal their social media activities to their boss and 54% even don’t want to disclose this information to their colleagues. A further 34% are against showing the content of their messages and emails to their employer.
