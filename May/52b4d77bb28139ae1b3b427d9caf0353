COLDS and flu are facts of life around this time of the year, especially for kids. All of us are born with an inexperienced immune system, and battle various germs and viruses as we grow and develop better immunity. This is why children doctors (paediatricians) consider six to eight colds per year quite normal. And it is in a school environment that germs spread more. This is not only because school going children are in close contact with each other, but also because a child’s immune system is less mature than that of an adult, so they are naturally more susceptible to germs. As Mzansi already feels the winter chill, people will spend more time indoors and in close proximity to each other. The viruses that cause the common cold spread easily in cold, dry air. According to iNova Pharmaceuticals, our nasal passages also get dry, allowing cold viruses to make us more sick than they do during warm summer months. Créche Guard is the best children’s multivitamin and mineral and has a range of products that can increase immunity and help to keep colds and flu at bay.
