Q: When did you buy this car? A: 2017. Q: Is this your first car? A: Yes. Q: Why do you like this one? A: It saves on petrol, is easy to drive and comfortable. Q: Which feature would you like to change? A: The rims and tyres, might as well drop it a little bit. Q: What features do you like most? A: The sound system is good. Q: Why did you choose thecolour? A: I had no choice but to take silver, which is not bad. Q: Have you driven long distance in it yet? A: I went as far as Zeerust, North West. Q: Do you get traffic fines? A: No, not that I know of. Q: Would you borrow your car to anyone? A: Yes, I wouldnâ€™t mind as long as I trust the driver. Q: What do you think of other road users? A: As a driver, I know when driving one has to think of other road users. However, there are those who think they own the road. There are also those who like to speed, which is why some motorists end up in accidents that could have been avoided. We should think of others and avoid speed to reduce accidents or even death at times.
