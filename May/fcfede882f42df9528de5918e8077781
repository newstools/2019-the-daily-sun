Residents with special needs were over the moon when they received the keys to their new houses in Delft, Cape Town on Wednesday. They told the SunTeam they had waited many years to own their own homes. Gogo Nompumelelo Sakhe (75) said: “I’m happy to finally get a home to live in safely with my daughter. “At first I thought I was dreaming but it was actually a dream come true. “I once lived with my late friend Landelwa Ntsoko. Two days ago I dreamt I was telling her I finally had a house. This has been my dream for a long time.” The houses were officially handed over by Human Settlements MMC Councillor Malusi Booi. He said the houses were designed with special facilities such as grab rails in the bathroom, sliding doors to the bathrooms and lowered light switches easily reached by people in wheelchairs. “Owning a home gives beneficiaries security and signifies the restoration of their dignity. “This is certainly a memorable moment for the beneficiaries. “Going forward, we remind our new property owners they are responsible for their homes,” said Booi. He encouraged them to make responsible decisions regarding their homes, which included maintenance and security. He advised the new home owners to draw up wills so their assets were proteced and handed over to the right people when they died. Booi said more qualifying residents would get houses in the coming months.
