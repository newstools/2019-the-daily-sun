A woman, who filmed her colleague allegedly abusing minor children at a Carletonville nursery school is expected to appear in court next week, following her arrest.  Police have not yet confirmed when the arrest took place.  The woman is expected to appear together with her colleague in the Oberholzer Magistrates Court on May 7. Assault charges The woman's 40-year-old colleague, who has not been named, was arrested on March 26 and appeared in court on charges of assault two days later.   "We have decided to close down this early childhood development centre. I ... learnt about this situation today. I was sent a clip during a meeting and I was deeply disturbed by what I saw and that is why I decided to come here," said Mayathula-Khoza said at the time. In one of the videos, the caregiver can be seen repeatedly slapping a toddler. The motive for the slapping is not known. In another video, a young girl is forced to clean up after having vomited. The child is slapped on her buttocks. In a third video, a toddler is slapped for what appears to be a refusal to sleep, News24 earlier reported. Mayathula-Khoza complained that the second woman failed to protect the minors when she saw her colleague allegedly assaulting the children and chose instead to film the incidents. The MEC said that the crèche in question was operating on an expired licence. "This is an illegal entity in operation. When I asked for the crèche's certificate, I looked at it and it is a 2016 certificate. The principal should have complied and applied for a new certificate, but she did not do that," the MEC explained. She earlier promised to charge the principal with neglect as the children were under her care when the abuse took place.
