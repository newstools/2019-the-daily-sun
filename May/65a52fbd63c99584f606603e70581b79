NEW channel Newzroom Afrika got off to a bad start on Wednesday. Ebenhaezer Keun of Breinstorm Brand Architects claimed on Twitter that the channel might have stolen its logo from Senegalese company SpeakUpAfrica. Channel head of marketing Zamahlasela Gabela yesterday said the channel was aware of the claim. “While there are visual similarities, Newzroom Afrika was not aware of SpeakUpAfrica or its logo before the Twitter complaint and your inquiry,” she told Daily Sun. “Given a similar brief, it may happen that two designers reach a similar visual representation of an idea. No official complaint has been made at this stage.” SpeakUpAfrica had not responded at the time of going to print.
