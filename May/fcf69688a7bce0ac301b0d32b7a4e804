THE National Freedom Party is at war with itself. Its leader, Zanele Magwaza-Msibi, says she does not recognise Vikizitha Mlotshwa. This is despite him having been sworn in as a member of the KZN legislature on Monday to represent the party. Mlotshwa, who was the NFP’s KZN premier candidate in the 8 May polls, was sworn in on Monday morning. He missed last week’s swearing in ceremony after the party served him with a letter of his dismal. NFP spokesman Simo Mkhwanazi said the party was not a “banana party”. He said the party did not recognise Mlotshwa’s swearing in. “He doesn’t represent the NFP but the court that he claims approved his swearing in,” he said. Mkhwanazi added that the party had filed papers challenging the decision. “As the NFP we noted with grave concern the latest developments where Mlotshwa was sworn in as NFP MPL in the KZN legislature. As far as the party is concerned, Mlotshwa is not a member of the party anymore. So we don’t understand how the legislature could swear him in without consulting us,” he said. Mkhwanazi said Mlotshwa was fired when he refused to step aside and allow Happy Khuzwayo to take the party’s only seat in the legislature. Wonder Hlongwa, spokesman for the Office of the Speaker, said Mlotshwa was sworn in after he produced a court order as proof that he could take up his seat. Bonga Nzuza, a senior NFP member in KZN, said he was happy Mlotshwa had finally been sworn in. He warned Magwaza-Msibi that what she was trying to do was illegal.
