A grandson of the "architect of apartheid", Dr HF Verwoerd, is reportedly making his way to Parliament on a Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) ticket. Netwerk24 reported that Dr Wynand Boshoff, son of Orania founder Prof. Carel Boshoff and FF Plus leader in the Northern Cape, has scored a seat in the National Assembly owing to the party's phenomenal growth in last week's general elections. In 2014, the FF Plus received 165 715 national votes. This time around, 414 864 people voted for the party. This is the party's best performance in a general election, News24 reported. It has grown its national support base from 0.90% in 2014 to 2.38%. Boshoff's mother, Anna, was the daughter of Verwoerd who served as prime minister of South Africa from 1958 to 1966. His brother, also Carel, is the "president" of Orania, a whites-only town in the Northern Cape. According to Netwerk24, Boshoff said he wanted to be judged on his own merits and not on those of his granddad. In the past years Orania, where he has lived since 1993, was his "weekend home" as he served as a councillor in the Sol Plaatje Municipality in Kimberley. Boshoff reportedly said he would be representing minority groups in Parliament, not only those of Afrikaners, but also those of coloured communities. SOURCE: News24
