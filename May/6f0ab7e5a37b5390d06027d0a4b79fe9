PARENTS heard rumours of gangs with knives at the school and decided to take action. Parents at Solomon Mahlangu Primary School in Cornubia, Durban said they heard one of the groups which carry knives wait for teachers and pupils to leave the school and then meet at the back of the school. On Wednesday afternoon, parents stormed the school after most pupils had gone home and found 10 boys smoking cigarettes and carrying knives. “Apparently the pupils, mostly in grade six and seven, have been carrying knives to school and threatening each another,” a parent said. “When we got there, they were shocked to see us. “We searched them and found four knives. “We asked them why they had formed the group and they said it was to protect themselves. But they didn’t say what they were fighting about.” Another parent said if there was a security guard, this could have been prevented. SGB chairman Bhekisisa Buthelezi said they wanted the department to intervene. “There’s never been security since the school was opened. I sit at the gate every day. I’m doing this alone and I need assistance,” he said. He said he found cigarettes and knives when he cut the grass. “The department must intervene before these pupils start stabbing and killing each other,” Bhekisisa said. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “This is a matter for the police. This is not about security guards. “Where is the society and community leadership here?”
