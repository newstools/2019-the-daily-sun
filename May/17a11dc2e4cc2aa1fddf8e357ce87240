YESTERDAY, Saray Khumalo became the first black woman from Africa to get to the top of the Mount Everest in Nepal. The Summits with a Purpose Facebook page said: “Saray is safely down below the south summit but still in the death zone.” An update on her progress was uploaded as she made her way back to base camp that read: “This is when all mental and physical endurance from the training and other mountain experience kicks in. She has been going for over 13 hours now. It will be two days before she arrives at base camp. “She shares her awesome achievement with everyone.” This is the fourth attempt by the Zambian-born businesswoman from Joburg. “In 2014, an avalanche killed 16 people and in 2015 there was an earthquake, while in 2017, strong winds and frostbite ended her climb and she was taken off the mountain by helicopter. In 2012, she climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and raised funds for the Lunchbox Fund. On her website, Saray said: “My dream is to pave a way for my children, so we may realise and accept that ordinary people like us can achieve extraordinary heights.” Fewer than 5 000 people have managed to get to the top of Everest since Edmund Hillary first reached it on 29 May, 1953. About 800 people try to climb Mount Everest every year and roughly 300 people have died on the mountain.
