 The DA has publicly quelled any notion that party leader Mmusi Maimane was in its crosshairs after a disappointing showing at the polls. Maimane is to remain leader of the party until its federal congress in 2021, the party leadership announced on Monday. "We would like to state that Mr Maimane remains our leader until Federal Congress, scheduled for 2021," said DA Federal Deputy Chairperson, Athol Trollip during a press briefing at the DA headquarters in Bruma, Johannesburg. Maimane was not present at the briefing. "Any talk of a change of leadership before a Federal Congress must be dispelled," said Trollip. This comes after a Federal Executive meeting post-elections as well as much speculation around Maimane's future after the DA lost support nationally and in some provinces in the May 8 elections. The DA's national support declined, with 470 396 fewer people voting for the party in this year's elections than in 2009. However, the drop in votes wasn't significant enough to shift it from its position as the official opposition in the National Assembly.
