VICKSON Mabunda has accused Mpho Nematandzela of taking desperate residents for a ride. Vickson, from Solly Msimanga Small Village in Nellmapius, Tshwane, said Mpho stole a circuit breaker from a community office. He said Mpho then sold the piece of equipment to residents. “He’s not an electrician. He can’t even change a light bulb. How does he get to have electrical equipment? “That man told residents he had a circuit breaker he could sell to us for R5 000.” Vickson said residents bought the circuit breaker when a transformer from which they had illegally connected electricity caught fire recently. He said the circuit breaker, some handcuffs and stamps, disappeared from the community office. “We looked for the circuit breaker until eventually we gave up. Community leaders were pointing fingers at each other.” Daily Sun contacted Mpho, who said Vickson was lying. “He should look for a job. He’s turned me into his project and is spreading lies about me,” said Mpho. “Other newspapers are tired of him and Daily Sun will soon realise he’s crazy and stop taking him seriously.” He said he’d take his circuit breaker back if residents didn’t want to pay him.
