A video of a shootout between a Cash-In-Transit security guard and criminals has surfaced on social media. In the video, the guard can be seen carrying a cash box, going towards the exit door of what looks like a shopping centre. As he nears the exit, two men begin walking towards him and a shootout ensues. The guard manages to protect the money and shot one of the tsotsis who was wearing a red jacket on the leg. The second man also fell during the shootout but managed to stand up and run away from the security guard. It is not clear where and when the incident took place. However, people on social media praised the security guard for protecting the money and giving the thugs a run for their lives.
