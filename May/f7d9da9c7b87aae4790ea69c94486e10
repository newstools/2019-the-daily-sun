ACTRESS Marietjie Bothma, known as Kasi Mlungu, has found another reason to love kasi life. She told Daily Sun she has found love and believes black men are the best as they are caring and know how to treat women. She said after she left an abusive mlungu in 2013, she vowed never to date a white man again. When Marietjie recently told the SunTeam who her new lover was, it turned out to be a man known to TV fans. It was none other than Ashby Barden, who appeared on Mzansi Magic’s Date My Family last year. The couple, who live in Alexandra in Joburg, even got engaged recently. Marietjie said after she met Ashby a year ago, she realised she’d found the man of her dreams. “My fiance is amazing. He’s not abusive. Despite being a hunk, he’s very supportive.” However, the two sometimes face challenges. Marietjie said mlungus asked her why she was with a black man and black women sometimes accused her of taking their man. Ashby told Daily Sun his heart melted on their first date. “It did feel strange though because she spoke Zulu while her skin is white and her eyes are blue,” said Ashby. He said he had always wished for a white woman because he believed they were honest, caring and warm-hearted. “I love Marietjie and she is my soulmate. There is no space for anyone else.”
