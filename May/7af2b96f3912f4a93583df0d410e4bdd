MUNICIPAL manager Sipho Ndabandaba has been suspended for allegedly attempting to use muthi against the mayor. Ndabandaba was suspended last week by mayor Petros Ngubane of Umzinyathi, near Dundee, KZN. Ndabandaba told Daily Sun on Sunday that he decided to go to court because the mayor refused to give him good reasons for his suspension. “It’s public knowledge that the mayor has accused me and other officials of using muthi against him, but I know it is just an excuse,” said Ndabandaba. “I know why he is targeting me, which I’m going to reveal in court.” A source at the municipality said the mayor and municipal manager started having problems after the mayor accused Ndabandaba of using muthi against him. Another source said the municipal manager refused to release funds for the mayor to campaign for the position of secretary at the IFP’s elective conference in July. Ngubane said he hasn’t consulted an inyanga or sangoma and had never accused anyone of muthi practice. He also denied that he demanded funds from the municipal manager to fund his campaign. He refused to give Daily Sun reasons for suspending the municipal manager, saying it was an internal matter. The municipality was placed under administration last year after allegations of mismanagement.
