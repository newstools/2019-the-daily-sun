ALTHOUGH Polokwane City boss Johnny Mogaladi insists his coach Jozef Vukusic is going nowhere, SunSport has it on good authority that the Slovakian has been linked to PSL newcomers Stellenbosch FC. Vukusic wants out after helping the team finish in an impressive fifth spot. Vukusic has already told the media this week that he has resigned as City coach, but Mogaladi is adamant that the coach is going nowhere. Mogaladi mentioned that Vukusic is expected back with the team next month for pre-season. But a source told SunSport Vukusic is keen to return to the Mother City. He had a stint with FC Cape Town in 2010. “Vukusic stayed in Cape Town for years and wants to go back there,” said the source. “Anything is possible. Even his family loves it in Cape Town and they are happy to relocate to the Mother City. But it won’t be easy for Vukusic to leave the club. Steve Barker led Stellies to the top flight of local football and if this story are anything to be believed, the former Pretoria University’s coach job could be on the line. “It won’t be easy for Vukusic to join Stellenbosch as he still has two years left in his contract with Rise and Shine. Vukusic is still my coach,” Mogaladi said. “I’m expecting him in camp next month for the pre-season. You know, the funny part is that I had an end-of-the-season farewell function with my staff and the coach was there with his family. Everyone was happy. “The first time I heard about this ‘I’m leaving’ thing was through the media. What I see written in the media can’t actually be coming from my coach.”
