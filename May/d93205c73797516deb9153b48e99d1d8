BLACK Leopards striker Mwape Musonda has commented on transfer rumours linking him with a move to Kaizer Chiefs, saying he would be willing to listen to their offer. The 28-year-old Zambian enjoyed a successful campaign, netting an impressive 16 goals to claim the Absa Premiership Golden Boot and help his side avoid relegation. This after firing in 15 goals in the 2017/18 season as Leopards earned promotion from the National First Division. His goalscoring exploits have not gone unnoticed, with the likes of Chiefs, Pirates and Sundowns credited with an interest in the player back in April. And with many players now preparing for some well earned rest during the off-season break, Musonda admits it would be hard to turn down an offer from Chiefs, should they come calling.When asked for his thoughts on the reported interest from Chiefs During the PSL Awards in Durban on Sunday evening, Musonda told reporters that he doesn't think anyone ca turn down an offer from Chiefs. "Yeah, obviously as a player you want to grow and I don't think anyone can turn down an offer like that."But then, it's not up to me, someone must call. You can't take yourself there [to Chiefs] and say 'I will play for you'."If they call you have to pick up the phone and hear what they are saying."Musonda was also asked for comment on his goal tally in the 2018/19 season, and he admitted his disappointment at missing out on the 20-goal mark."I think for me it's more of being surprised if I don't score," he explained. "I have challenged myself because I am not happy with the 16 goals that I have scored."If you look back you'll see that I missed a lot of goal scoring opportunities, where only if I had composed myself I would have gone to 20 goals, which is the tally the league has been crying about, that we don't reach."It's a challenge for me to do it next season."
