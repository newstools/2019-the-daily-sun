THE Witbank Magistrates Court heard how a mum spent days with her four kids’ bodies in her rented room in Klarinet, Emalahleni. Zinhle Maditla was appearing in court on Thursday to apply for bail. She’s accused of killing her four kids, aged four, eight, seven and 11 months. Giving out her statement of what transpired between 26 to 29 December, Investigating officer Lucia Mathenjwa revealed shocking details of what allegedly happened between 26 and 29 December last year. She has been in custody since December last year and wants to be released on bail while awaiting her trial. Mathenjwa suggested Zinhle had visited her ex-lover, with whom she had two kids. She’s said to have had an argument with him after finding him with another woman. On her way home on that day, Zinhle allegedly bought rat poison, put it in her kids’ meal, and laced her breast with it before feeding her 11-month-old baby. Two of the children began complaining about headaches and stomach cramps, moments later they were dead. Zinhle allegedly cleaned up the children and them and laid them on the bed after they were dead. Zinhle allegedly kept the bodies wrapped in a blanket in her room for days. The bodies, which had started to rot, were discovered by her landlord. The case was postponed to 5 June for continuation of the bail application.
