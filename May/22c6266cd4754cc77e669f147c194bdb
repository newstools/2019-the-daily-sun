CHIEF Khoisan SA has been crowned president and king of the Khoisan nation. King Khoisan SA was ordained at the Union Buildings grounds in Tshwane yesterday by national Khoisan spiritual leader Bishop Victor Gelderbloem. Khoisan SA had said he would not vote as he felt the political system made a lot of promises but did not fulfil them. He told Daily Sun that the Khoisan will work with any race and will not chase anyone from the country. “We have declared our sovereignty today... We are a peaceful nation, but we will claim everything in the country,” he said. “I’m very overwhelmed and was not expecting to be chosen as Khoisan leader. “I want to steer the process towards first-nation recognition and rights, and I will also talk about the land issue.” Gelderbloem said this was a symbolic inauguration of the first indigenous nation of southern Africa. “We did the ordination on voting day because President Cyril Ramaphosa didn’t know 8 May is the sign of a new beginning for the Khoisan.” Gelderbloem. The spiritual leader carried out some protection rituals for the newly appointed king. “We protected him against opposition and from evil spirits,” he said. The Khoisan arrived at the Union Buildings grounds on 30 November last year and vowed not to leave until they spoke to Ramaphosa. Government said the Khoisan grievances were being considered.
