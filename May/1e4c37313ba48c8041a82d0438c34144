Caster Semenya has taken to Twitter for a second time following Wednesday's confirmation that she lost her appeal against rules designed to decrease naturally high testosterone levels in some female runners. The decision by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) means that women with elevated testosterone will have to take suppressive treatment if they wish to compete against women in certain events. In a 2-1 decision, CAS judges dismissed Semenya's appeal against the measures imposed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) that compel "hyperandrogenic" athletes - or those with "differences of sexual development" (DSD) - to artificially lower their testosterone levels. The judges said that although the rules are "discriminatory... such discrimination is a necessary, reasonable and proportionate means of achieving the IAAF's aim of preserving the integrity of female athletics in the Restricted Events." Immediately following the ruling, Semenya tweeted, ""Sometimes it's better to react with no reaction".  Hours later, Semenya took to social media once again to draw comparisons to renowned Days of Our Lives villain Stefano DiMera who, according to the soap opera storyline, survived no fewer than 13 attempts on his life. Semenya wrote: "monate mpolaye.?? My vibes are so cool. Call me Stefano dimera if you want to. I'm a die hard that's a fact..??"
