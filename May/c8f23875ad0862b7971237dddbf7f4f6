RESIDENTS of uMsinga, outside Greytown in the KZN Midlands, will now be able to contribute to the province’s economy. This follows the launch of the uMsinga Clothing Factory in Keates Drift. The factory, formerly known as Bata Shoes, stopped operating 25 years ago as Bata Shoes , leaving many people without jobs. Zikalala said the closure affected many families as the factory was the only source of income for many residents. “We strongly believe that the number of residents that were previously employed here can be doubled if the factory grows and expands its operations,” he said. He said the new factory is 100% owned by women. He praised Lelly Mntungwa, who left asteady job at a bank to uplift locals after she learned the area was one of the poorest in the country. Zikalala said Lelly used her own money to refurbish one section of the old factory structure which had been vandalised. “We are grateful for her vision and wish to thank her for all her hard work. “We are also proud that it employs women.” The factory is now a bustling hive of activity and employs 137 locals. “It doesn’t end there, tThe factory also employs 50 youths who will produce sanitary pads to alleviate the problem of young girls in this rural area missing school when they have their periods,” Zikalala told Daily Sun. He added that they will continue supporting initiatives like these as they become the engine of the economic development. The factory is funded through the department’s Women Economic Empowerment programme. About R4 million was injected into this factory. Zikalala has also opened a new Ithala bank cashless ATM at a shop owned by local businessman, Khwezi Majola. He said the ATM will mainly benefit Sassa grant beneficiaries, who’ll now be able to access money in their own neighbourhood. The MEC said the cashless ATM will also benefit the general public.
