THE Mgenges are asking for a Good Samaritan to help them rebuild their house after they were allegedly turned away by their councillor. They told Daily Sun their four-roomed house in Molweni, west of Durban, collapsed in March. They said when they approached the councillor, they were told to return after the election. Gogo Gladys Mgenge (71) said: “When there was that heavy rain, half of the house collapsed. This forced to us live in the two rooms that were still intact.” She said they were unable to rebuild their house as no one in the family was employed. “Since half of the house collapsed, the remaining two rooms are no longer stable. We fear it might collapse at any time and bury us alive,” she said. “We don’t know where to turn to as the councillor told us he would only be able to help us after the election.” Gladys’ daughter, Nozipho (34), said they were shocked by the councillor’s response. “We’ve been sleeping in this unstable house. We rely on prayers that the house doesn’t bury us in our sleep. When it’s rainy and windy, we’re scared to stay inside and often go to our neighbour’s house,” she said. Councillor Siphiwe Mncube denied telling the family he would only help them after the election but confirmed he was aware of the situation. “I know their problem. They are on the list being sent to the disaster and housing department for help,” Mncube said.
