ANC deputy president David Mabuza won't be sworn in as a member of the National Assembly on 22 May. The ANC said it has received and agreed to a request by the ANC Deputy President to postpone his swearing in, scheduled for 22 May. Mabuza made the request in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute. He has indicated that he would like to have an opportunity to address the Integrity Commission on these allegations. "In the meantime, he has decided nevertheless to follow the dictates of his conscience and postpone his swearing in as a member of the National Assembly out of respect for the ANCâ€™s institutions and processes. "The Deputy President believes that the ANC as a governing party should advance the electoral mandate in an environment of public trust. "The ANC commends Deputy President Mabuza for the stance he has taken and I personally applaud his resolve to put the interests of the ANC first," said president Cyril Ramaphosa.
