JOHANNESBURG Roads Agency employees are gatvol of the constant sewage spills and rubbish piling up outside their offices. They are also upset with their bosses for not taking their complaints seriously. “We’re basically compromising our health by coming to work,” said one of the five employees who contacted Daily Sun. He said what made matters worse was that dozens of vagrants and homeless people lived on the streets near their offices, and made the place dirty and unliveable. “We have to chase them away every morning before we start work. “We have complained numerous times about this issue but nothing is being done,” he said. Another employee said a sewerage pipe burst every two to three weeks, creating a health hazard and an unbearable situation. “It’s really bad. But we have no choice as we have to feed our families.” Daily Sun sent questions to the agency’s spokeswoman, Zoleka Jika, three days ago. But she had not responded at the time of going to print yesterday.
