SA under-20 national men’s team coach Thabo Senong is pleased with how their preparations for the fast approaching Fifa U-20 World Cup are going. Amajita are stepping up their performances as they gear up for the showpiece set to be staged in Poland from 25 May until 16 June. They have played three friendly games so far and Senong is getting closer to his final 21 man squad for the tournament. They edged Qatar 1-0 in their latest friendly match at the X-Bionic sporting grounds in Samarin, Slovakia on Sunday. Although Senong has been pleased with his side’s progress leading up to their fourth World Cup, he believes they still need to improve a few aspects of their game. “We have to go back to the drawing board and work on our finishing and creating more chances,” said Senong. “We need to remain humble and work on a few aspects of our game before the tournament starts. “The boys did well to win against Qatar, who are a difficult opponent to break down, they are very organised and compact and they have good attackers on the wide positions. “But we dealt with them, we were compact and disciplined but we should have score more goals.” Senong, who is the first South African coach to have qualify for back-to-back U20 World Cup tournaments, is looking forward to the big test lying in wait. Amajita are in a difficult Group F which also includes the likes of Argentina, Korea Republic and Portugal. Senong, though, is confident that his charges, who are the underdogs in their group, can compete and hold their own if they play as a team. "In our tactics, we encourage collective play in defence, in transition and in attack. Total football in all phases of the game can be key in helping our players enjoy their football and most importantly, get results and help our team perform better at the World Cup,” added Senong. Amajita will next play Uruguay (15 May) and Ukraine (18 May) to continue their preparations.
