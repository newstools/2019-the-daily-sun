POLOKWANE City coach Jozef Vukusic will go back home in Slovakia a happy man! Following his team’s performance in his first season at the club where they finished with a record number of points attained this season, Vukusic must be feeling proud. Rise and Shine, despite losing 3-0 to Orlando Pirates in the last game of the season at Orlando Stadium on Saturday, finished the season fifth on the log with 44 points, which is 11 more than the past season, 2017-18, when they finished 12th. In the 2016-17 season, under the tutelage of former coach, Luc Eymael, they completed the season in sixth place with 43. Eymael, who resigned in March 2017, was replaced by Bernard Molekwa, who is currently Vukusic.’s assistant coach. This season City were a marvel to watch. Their classy skipper, Jabulani Maluleka has been the heartbeat of the team and it will come as no surprise if he is nominated in the Midfielder of the Season category for the PSL Awards scheduled for Durban’s ICC on Sunday. The nominees will be announced in Durban today. Said Vukusic: “My players showed they are really talented. We broke the records. “I thank them (players) for the whole season’s performance and that for me was very important.” City are better known for picking up players on free transfers, and you hardly see clearly a plan in place from management. That same style of signing players is unlikely to change when the 2019-20 season kicks off. In terms of reinforcing the squad ahead of next season to go one better, Vukusic said he will add two quality players to improve his team. “When I came here at the club I couldn’t work on transfers, but I selected what I have within this team,” he said. “I’m sure the majority of the players will stay. We are not like those clubs who would release and sign 15 to 20 players in a season.”
