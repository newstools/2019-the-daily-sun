 Millions of
South Africans cast their votes on Wednesday, but not before they got their daily
dose of amagwinya. At some
point during the process of queuing to vote, the queue to buy amagwinya was
longer than the queue for voting. But after queuing
for them, they soon joined the voting queue – some of the youth that was there
said they want access to education for their children. They said: “Akekho
umntwana ozohlala ekhaya abheme inyaope.” Loosely translated as “no child of
ours will smoke nyaope.
