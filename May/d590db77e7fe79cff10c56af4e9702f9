HELP the Skhosana family find their missing son Tiro! Tiro Skosana (23) from Orchards in Tshwane went missing on 20 April this year. According to his mum Gladys Skosana (52), Tiro left home at about 2pm, driving a 2007 grey VW Polo 1.6. “My son left to buy car parts at Midas in Gezina and that was the last time we saw him,” she said. Gladys said Tiro was wearing blue denim shorts, red Levi sneakers and a white T-shirt. “He has a beard,” she said. She said Tiro is a motor mechanic in Pretoria West and told Daily Sun he never used to leave home without letting them know. She said the car he was driving also disappeared. “His phone was off at the time that he disappeared. We have tried his friends and relatives and he isn’t with them.” Gladys said a colleague said he last saw Tiro at his flat on the day of his disappearance, and he told him he was going home. She said they opened a case on 22 April at Pretoria North Police Station. “We can’t sleep as we are very worried.” Police spokeswoman Captain Riana van Aarde said: “A missing person’s case was registered and is being investigated by Akasia police.” Anyone with information must please call 012 564 0700.
