A MUM is devastated after the death of her son. She believes he would still be alive if an ambulance had arrived. She now wants answers from Ekurhuleni Emergency Services, even though she has already buried her son. Mavis Cheonyane (49), from Duduza in Ekurhuleni, said the incident happened on 12 May. She said she received a call from her niece, who told her that her son Themba (35) had allegedly overdosed on pills. She said they called for an ambulance when she got home and her neighbours helped. But their numerous calls kept being put on hold. She said she tried to organise transport to take her son to hospital while continuing to get hold of the ambulance service. They finally found transport and her son finally got to hospital at 8pm and was admitted. Mavis said he was stable when they spoke on the phone. But she received a call from the hospital the next day to say he had died. “My son would still be alive if the ambulance had come. I’m sad and disappointed with Ekurhuleni Emergency Services. I’m actually still waiting for them to call me back as they said they would.” Ekurhuleni Emergency Services spokesman William Ntladi told Daily Sun the matter is being investigated. “We will find out exactly what happened and the family will get answers,” said Ntladi.
