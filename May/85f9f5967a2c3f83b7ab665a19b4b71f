EVENT organisers claim amapiano DJ Papers 707 takes money for performances but doesn’t show up. Three Gauteng organisers told Daily Sun the DJ, whose real name is Vusi Mabuza, took their money. Lethu Rasegwete, Johnny Mahlangu and Thabile Zihlangu said they paid R1 000 but he didn’t pitch. Lethu said: “A day before the event at the beginning of the month, I heard he never pitches. “I tried calling him but his phone was off. He didn’t pitch in the end.” Rasegwete said the next day, Papers said he didn’t have time for small gigs. Mahlangu said the DJ only arrived at his event last month after it ended. “He didn’t want to pay the deposit back. He finally paid me when I threatened to expose him.” Zihlangu said Papers didn’t pitch at his event last month. “He said he had a R40 000 gig. We never got our money.” DJ Papers 707 said: “I try to speak to them but my battery dies. I become busy and come late, but it’s not on purpose.”
