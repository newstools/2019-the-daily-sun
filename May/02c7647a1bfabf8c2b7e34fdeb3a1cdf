A BARBERTON warder was suspended after allegedly smuggling 4kg of dagga into prison on Sunday. Bhekithemba Thwala (33) was suspended after chief operations commissioner Mandla Mkabela’s surprise visit to check on operations at the centre. Ehlanzeni Correctional Centre spokesman Messiah Hlungwani said as officials started to report for duty, the commissioner gave the instruction that everyone entering the correctional centre must be searched. “The emergency support team started to search all officials as they reported for work. “During the search, they noticed a container in one of the cars, in which there were two officials. “The owner of the container, who works at Medium B, pleaded with them not to open it, saying it had food in it.” Hlungwani said the team insisted on opening the container and found dagga in it. “Thwala tried to escape from the scene by running to the nearest bush. “A chase ensued and he was arrested,” he said. Thwala was handed over to Barberton police. He was charged with dealing in dagga and smuggling illegal goods to offenders. He appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Monday and was granted R500 bail. His case was postponed to 21 June for investigation. Hlungwani said the department had appointed an internal investigator to investigate.
