SINCE the murder of her father three weeks ago, Nonhlanhla Maphalala has been living in fear. Speaking to Daily Sun, the 31-year-old from Zola, in Soweto, alleged her stepmum wanted to kill her. Nonhlanhla said whenher father was killed in Orange Farm at the beginning of the month, she rushed to the scene. “He was found dead in the car but the killer didn’t take anything. “His wallet and cellphone were still on him. It showed the person only wanted him dead,” she said. Nonhlanhla said her issue with her stepmum started when police took the stepmum’s cellphones. Her stepmother accused her of being behind their action. “She told me I was the one who made the police take her cellphones and said I would follow my father,” she said. Nonhlanhla said she went to open a case of intimidation but the police advised her to rather apply for a protection order. “I don’t know what this woman wants from me. I’m still grieving for my father, who was buried last weekend, and now this happens,” she said. “We believe our father would still be alive if he hadn’t taken her back.” The two were divorced. When the SunTeam spoke to the stepmum, she said Nonhlanhla was the one harassing her. A case of murder was opened at Orange Farm Police Station. Nonhlanhla has applied for a protection order.
