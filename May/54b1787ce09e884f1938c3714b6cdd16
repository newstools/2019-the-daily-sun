DRIVING on the Old Uitenhage Road in Port Elizabeth is a nightmare for motorists. The road is full of potholes and a drain overflows onto it. The road is also busy as it is being used as an alternative route to the Uitenhage freeway, which is under construction. Motorist Lindelwa Vusani (38) told Daily Sun: “We drive in zig zag lines here because we have to avoid potholes and now this drain is causing more headaches. “During peak hour, this road is very congested. Some of the motorists speed and this sewage spills into our vehicles. “This drain’s been overflowing for a week and municipal vehicles pass by all the time, yet nothing’s done. My car’s dirty and stinks.” Taxi driver Ryaan van Rooyen (36) said the road between Khayamnandi and Smartie Town was full of potholes. “Driving over this kak is disgusting. Passengers complain about our taxis smelling like kak. We’re constantly forced to change tyres as the road damages them,” he said. Daily Sun tried to get comment from Nelson Mandela Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki. His phone rang unanswered. He had not responded to SMSes at the time of going to print.
