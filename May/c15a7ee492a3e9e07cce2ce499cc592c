TWO Eastern Cape women are doing everything they can to preserve intonjane,  a rite of passage for Xhosa women. Nokhwezi Rala (53) and Nokwanda Ngqobotyi (53) of Kwa-Nonqubela in Alexandria, near Port Alfred, recently formed the Umngqungqo cultural group to keep the tradition alive. Nokhwezi told Daily Sun said: “The taverns are full because we have lost our identity.” She said she and Nokwanda had been practising and preaching intonjaneand its importance for more than 30 years. “The custom is performed when a girl reaches puberty. It symbolises the move from being a child to being a woman. “All the girls who take part in this ritual are virgins,” she said. “Wherever there is intonjanewe go, even if we are not invited, because it is our responsibility to celebrate with the initiate,” Nokwanda said. She said they were not paid because they viewed it as their responsibility to teach girls about morals and the value of being a Xhosa woman. “We go as far as Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth with these kids, performing intonjane,” Nokwanda said. She said the custom would lead to problems if ignored. “When it is ignored it can lead to bed wetting. Others complain about body pains that can’t even be cured until the ritual is done,” she added.
