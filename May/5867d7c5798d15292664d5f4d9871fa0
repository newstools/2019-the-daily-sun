AL THOUGH she’s only 11 years old, Naledi Mphahlana has won a number of beauty pageants. Naledi, from Bloemanda in Mangaung, started competing in pageants when she was only five years old. Since then, the grade 6 pupil at Brebner Primary School has made her parents and teachers proud. Her mum, Mamickey Nkabi-Nhlapo (42) said she started sending Naledi to modelling classes at @Models and Finishing Academy last year when she realised she had talent. Naledi was a finalist in the Miss Environmental SA pageant last month, where she became first princess and won the Public Choice Award. Last week, she was chosen as a finalist in the Miss Pre-Teen Free State Arts Festival pageant, which will take place in July. Mamickey said: “My child is very active. She likes swimming, dancing and modelling. She also plays soccer at school.” Naledi said her dream was to one day become Miss Universe or Miss World, before opening her own modelling agency. She said her role models were Bonang Matheba and Nigerian model Idia Aisien. Mamickey said: “She was also chosen as ambassador for the OneChildOnePack project, which gives sanitary towels to disadvantaged girls. “As her mum, I support her. Her family is always with her.”
