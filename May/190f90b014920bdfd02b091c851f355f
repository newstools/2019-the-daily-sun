OVER 13 people have lost their lives after a bus lost control and crashed on the N1 North in Louis Trichardt, Limpopo. The MEC of Transport and Community Safety, in Limpopo Makoma Makhurupetjie expressed her heartfelt condolences to the families of the thirteen Zimbabwean nationals. Makhurupetjie also wished a speedy recovery to thirteen others who were injured during the crash. She said at this stage no conclusive evidence has been found which points out to the exact cause of the accident although reckless driving is not ruled out as the possible cause. “We are deeply concerned about accidents involving buses as they lead to more loss of lives compared to ordinary motor vehicles. The driver and vehicle fitness of long-distance cross border buses is also a matter of deep concern to us, as this is almost the third time now that we are losing lives because of long distance buses," she said. Makhurupetjie added that it is about time that law enforcement officers step up their routine checks on buses to prevent this kind of accidents from happening. “I also call upon drivers of buses and other public transport to take rest in between trips, as the lives of passengers remain in their hands,” added Makhurupetje.
