TRANSPORT Minister Blade Nzimande has announced the government’s plan to transform the minibus taxi industry. Nzimande said in Hatfield, Pretoria, that the government had decided to revise the taxi recapitalisation programme to meet the current and future needs of commuters and to stimulate the economic potential of the industry. He said the recapitalisation programme started in March. “As part of our commitment to support the taxi industry, government has decided to increase the taxi scrapping allowance from R91 100 to R124 000 per old scrapped taxi,” he said. He said a total of 72 653 old taxis had been scrapped and R4.4 billion paid in scrapping allowances by the end of September. “Commercial enterprises include the affordable supply of new taxi vehicles, finance, short-term insurance, spare parts, repairs, fuel, lubricants, electronic fare collection and property management.” He said 2 353 converted Toyota panel vans were identified as illegal. Of these, 436 were retrofitted. The 1 917 illegally converted Toyota panel vans will have to be scrapped and the owners paid an allowance. The taxi industry transports an estimated 15 million passengers a day.
