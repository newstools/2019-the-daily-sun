Mamelodi 	Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has heaped praise on his players for their resilience in what has been a taxing season so far. Downs, who were recently knocked out of the CAF Champions League in the semi-finals by Wydad Casablanca, were back to winning ways in the league on Tuesday. The Tshwane giants brushed aside Golden Arrows in their catch up fixture at Loftus Stadium to return to the top of the Absa Premiership standings. Downs head into the final day of the season in the ideal position with the title race firmly in their hands. They could defend their title with victory over Free State Stars at Goble Park on Saturday (3.pm). Mosimane has been mightily impressed by the determination his charges have shown this season, despite having to contend with a hectic schedule. "These boys, they have the passion hey,” Mosimane told SuperSport TV. “They just keep on going. But you can see they are not there in the final 20 minutes. We need to kill the game earlier. It's good for them, the supporters. "If they can match last year's record it will be unbelievable. For me it is the best season we have played. We just have the passion. I'm hoping this car doesn't stop at the end. "You know when you are running with the reserve tank and you get stuck just before the garage? I just hope that doesn't happen.
