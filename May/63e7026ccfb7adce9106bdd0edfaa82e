Lindiwe Ndiniso’s living with a disability because, she claims, a clinic failed to help her. The 32-year-old from Port St Johns said she visited Qandu Clinic after her left foot started bothering her four years ago. But she was allegedly told to go home and return another time. “They didn’t even check what was wrong with me and I believe if this problem had been attended to, it would have been fine.” Lindiwe said she couldn’t support her kids because no one wanted to give her piece jobs now because she can’t walk properly. Lindiwe said the problem started when she woke up one day with cramps in her leg and foot. “I thought I would be fine if I visited the clinic.” Health department spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said Lindiwe should have gone to the customer care unit. “That is where complaints are processed and people are allocated reference numbers to check their progress.” Sicwetsha forwarded Lindiwe’s complaint to the district to attend to them.
