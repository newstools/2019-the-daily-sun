IT’S believed the cabinet is to be pruned. Apparently, nine ministries and 15 deputy minister positions are to be done away with. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga told Daily Sun: “The point is delivery, whether the cabinet is big or small. It shouldn’t be too much about the cost. “The main driver must be delivery. As long as the ministries are aligned well, it will be the right way to do it.” President Cyril Ramaphosa has long been under pressure to clean up the government and get rid of those associated with scandals. At present, there are 34 ministers and 36 deputy ministers in 34 departments. “If that’s the political will, Ramaphosa will be forced to do away with some ministers. There are those who will not be happy, but this is going to happen,” said Mathekga. “The cabinet has been growing for some time and there was no explanation for it.” Some departments were split in the past and given new names, while others were created when former president Jacob Zuma first came to power in 2009. The president will appoint his cabinet next Sunday.
