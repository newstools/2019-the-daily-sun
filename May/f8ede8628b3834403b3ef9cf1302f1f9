A LATE strike Tendai Ndoro secured a hard-fought 1-0 win for Highlands Park over Bloemfontein Celtic in the Premiership on Saturday at Makhulong Stadium. The Lions of the North started more confidently of the two sides and created a few half chances early on, by the visitors defence was able to hold firm. Celtic battled their way into the game and almost stole the lead against the run of play midway through the first half, but Ndumiso Mabena blew his chance well over the bar. The hosts then seized the initiative once again but both Peter Shalulile and Mothobi Mvala were wayward in front of goal and the sides went into half time at 0-0. In contrast to the first period, Celtic were by far the better side after the break, dominating possession but were not able to do much with it. Their passing in the final third of the pitch was atrocious and, despite threatening for most of the half, didn't create any chances of note. Things started to look even better for the visitors when Mvela was sent off in the 71st minute for committing his second yellow card offense. Unfortunately for Celtic's fans it would be Highlands Park who would have the last laugh. A momentary lapse in concentration by the visitors defence was all it took for Ndoro to burst into space behind them, pick up a deft through ball and slot it past Patrick Tignyemb to secure the victory in the 86th minute. The win had the double effect of giving the Lions of the North an outside shot at a top eight finish while in turn putting a huge dent in Celtics own hopes of a top-half finish.
