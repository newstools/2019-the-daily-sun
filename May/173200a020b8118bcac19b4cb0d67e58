It is fairly common to see babies of a few days old out and about at the mall, lovingly cradled in mom’s or dad’s arms. Perhaps you have noticed, though, that these newborns are mostly white and that you seldom see black babies out in public at such a young age? What’s going on here? Dr Tiny Mhinga from Fourways jokes that “black parents must just have an extra layer of overprotectiveness...” before saying that it is a fallacy that newborns can’t go out within days of birth. “All babies, irrespective of their skin colour, are born with some natural protection. They have yellow fat known as adipose tissue. This fat is there to help cushion and insulate the body and as the child grows older it disappears and becomes thinner and thinner,” explains Dr Mhinga. He adds the reason babies are inoculated immediately after birth is to help strengthen their immune system in order for them to be able to fight germs. However, retired cultural expert Professor Jabulani Maphalala from the University of Zululand holds a different view about when a baby can go out in the world.Duke of Sussex gifted newborn booties and bonnet There are cultural reasons why many new black moms stay home with their little ones for up to three months. He wishes for people to understand why some cultures require things be done in a certain way, before just dismissing it out of hand.        Many a paediatrician will advise new moms that fresh air is great for both baby and mom, and that going for a walk can be good for your circulation. But attempting this on day two of being home might be overdoing it. If you’ve been home for a few days and are yearning to get out, stroll around the garden and if the weather is fine, your baby can join you. But don’t go on a fitness walk just yet. Generally, the medical consensus is that for the first six to eight weeks of the baby’s arrival new parents should exercise caution about taking their newborn to crowded places like malls and supermarkets, or other siblings’ schools, or even church, as the chance of exposure to many germs increases the more people there are around. If you minimise your child’s exposure, you give his immune system a chance to get up and running. "I took my new baby out for the first time when she was four weeks old. I just didn’t feel comfortable taking her anywhere before that – she seemed too vulnerable to me. Besides, I had leaky breasts and didn’t feel like facing strangers. I did go for short walks in a quiet park. I didn’t really enjoy our first outing to the supermarket and couldn’t wait to get home to safety and where everything is sanitary!" "I am not Zulu but I did follow the cultural way of doing things, as per my mother’s advice. I moved in with her for a month and breastfed exclusively. Not once did I go out in public with him before the month was over and no outside guests were welcomed except for family and my close friends." "I did none of the traditional things, but chose to hold back on exposing my baby to many people. I started feeling comfortable after a month and since it was December I attended a Christmas party with her at a friend’s place. I did, however, take her out for walks around the neighbourhood for my sanity as well." "As a Christian, I believe God will look after my child. So, I was out and about on his first visit to the doctor. My husband and I went to a restaurant when he was only two months old. I made sure though to avoid crowded places like the church, but visitors were welcomed."
