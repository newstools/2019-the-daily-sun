ON SUNDAY Zodwa got down on her bended knee and asked her long-time lover Ntokozo Linda to be her husband. “I’m the one who proposed to him,” she said. “AND I’M THE ONE WHO WILL SEND UNCLES TO PAY LOBOLA FOR HIM!” She said when she asked him she was ready for anything. “We have been together for six years. When I proposed to him, I was ready for any response. I would have accepted it if he’d said no. But I am happy to say he said yes,” said Zodwa. She said she knows there are women who take loans and borrow money so their men can pay lobola. “Stop giving your men money for lobola and hiding the truth,” said Zodwa after slipping the ring on his finger. Videos of the big moment went viral on social media after she slipped the ring on Ntokozo’s finger at the Eyadini Lounge in Umlazi, KZN. Zodwa told Daily Sun they’ll be getting married this year, and they will have both a traditional and a white wedding. Zodwa said she is proud to be paying lobola but is worried about being rejected by his family. “There are people who judge me but they don’t worry me,” she said. “I don’t know if his family will be okay with me, as the woman, paying the lobola.” Zodwa said she loved her man and he realised that she is getting older. In the video, Zodwa is heard saying, “Le ring ngiyithenge ngemali yendunu,” which means: I bought this ring with the money from my bum. “People are always saying I am selling my bum but I’m just an entertainer who makes money being naked. “I know what I am doing,” she said.
