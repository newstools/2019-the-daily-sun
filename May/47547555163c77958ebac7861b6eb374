 Two men died and three others are fighting for their lives in
hospital. This comes after the car they were travelling in rolled several
times off the N12 outside of Fochville last night around 7pm. The ER24 spokesperson, Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived
on the scene at to find a car on the side of the road on a small embankment. Meiring said five men were found lying trapped inside the
vehicle. “Paramedics quickly assessed the patients and found that two
men had sustained numerous fatal injuries,” he said. Meiring said nothing could be done for them and they were
later declared dead. “The three remaining men were assessed and found to have
sustained minor to moderate injuries. Fire services freed the three injured, as
well as the two fatalities from the vehicle using the jaws-of-life equipment,”
said Meiring. “Once freed, paramedics treated the men and thereafter
transported them to Carletonville Provincial Hospital for further care,” he
added.
