AS COUGHING patients waited to see the doctor, six officials suddenly stormed in. People sitting in the waiting room in Motherwell NU7, Nelson Mandela Bay, said the officials produced ID cards and demanded to see Nigerian doctors. But the doctors refused to come out. Patient Nomawethu Sangqa told Daily Sun: “The cops were wearing normal clothes and asked the receptionist to call the doctors. “She came back 10 minutes later and said the doctor was not there. When she was asked why she took so long, she couldn’t answer. “One doctor came out and pretended to be a patient who had just been examined. He got into his car and sped off. The second doctor tried to run away but was caught in the street behind the surgery. “The surgery manager was caught trying to hide at a local creche.” Nomawethu said she only trusted one doctor at the surgery. A patient (52) said: “I became suspicious of these doctors when they injected my son who had TB symptoms and didn’t remove the injection. They have surgeries all over. They must rot in jail. They’re gambling with our lives.” Captain Andre Beetge had no information about this incident. Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said: “These are private doctors. Call the Health Professions Council of SA.” The council’s Fezile Sifunda said’’: We have to speak to the inspectorate officers to provide information.”
