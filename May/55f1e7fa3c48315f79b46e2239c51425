SIYABONGA Sgwebela from KwaMancinza, north of Durban, went missing last Saturday. The 27-year-old’s family said a resident came to tell them on Sunday Siyabonga was caught in a warehouse in Lindelani trying to steal and was beaten to death. His mother-in-law Nozipho Mchunu (41) said they went to the warehouse but Siyabonga wasn’t there. “Residents told us they heard he was beaten in the warehouse.” They heard people saw a car parking inside the warehouse and workers loading something into the boot. “Maybe they were loading Siyabonga to dump him somewhere.” “We told cops everything residents told us but they’re failing to find those who did this, even though they live in the area.” She said Siyabonga smoked drugs but didn’t bother them. They’re worried as he hasn’t been found yet. “We want the suspects to show where they dumped him so he can be buried. They can be bust and we can close this chapter,” Nozipho said. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the missing person’s cases officer wasn’t available on weekends.
