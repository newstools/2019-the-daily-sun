THE first edition of the reality show Uyajola 9/9 on Sunday night was an instant hit. Especially because it featured a man who was worried his wife, an atchar trader, was delivering a lot more than the bottled pickle! And while she was caught only three houses away, her broken-hearted husband was in for the nastiest surprise of all. The husband, known as Bra Voice saw his hot wife in action – and it wasn’t selling atchar! His wife revealed their first born son was the neighbour’s child, not his!  And then son Themba arrived – and he looked just like the woman’s lover! The show which premiered on Moja Love is about busting cheaters and it’s hosted by rapper and TV presenter Jub Jub, who’s real name is Molemo Maarohanye (39). It immediately got the approval of social media users, while some expressed fears of appearing on the show. Lindiwe Mbonami, Moja Love’s head of marketing, told Daily Sun they didn’t realise how much people would love the show.  “We work on bringing shows with human interest, but this is fantastic,” she said. Here are some reaction from Twitter users @ThulaniWrite: “I think it’s the country’s duty to report that Jub Jub is violating his parole conditions.”? @YoliHeaven wrote: “Themba really looks like the neighbour.
