AT the tender age of five, this young girl witnessed both
her parents die in a hail of bullets. This was after the couple was allegedly cornered and shot in
Extension 28, Vosloorus on Wednesday. After hearing 15 to 20 shots, William Songezi who lives
nearby, peeped out to see what had happened, but when got there the shooters
were gone. The couple in the front seats, lied motionless in the car
while the child was crying in the back seat and struggling to speak. The bodies of her parents were riddled with bullets. He said that he didn’t believe the sight of a young girl
bleeding from what looked like bullet wounds. “The child was crying until the ambulance came,” he said. “What I’ve seen here it is the saddest thing I’ve seen since
I’ve started living here.” Based on what he saw, he said the mother looks like she took
a lot of bullets and looks like she was shot in the head and the child was shot
on the leg. William said they have a problem with the bush that is in
front of their yards. He alleges that the bush harbours criminals because of
people who are going to work and school kids who cross the open field to work
and school respectively. He added that the bush is a platform for petty crimes, such
as muggings and other crimes. Police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw, confirmed that that a
double murder case and attempted murder were registered at the Vosloorus SAPS. “The minor is in hospital and out of danger. He added that the motive of the shooting is still unknown at
this stage.
