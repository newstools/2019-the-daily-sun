T he line-up for this year’s Standard Bank Joy of Jazz has been announced. The 22nd annual showcase of African and international jazz musicians has a vibrant line-up this year and includes seasoned musicians from all over the continent. Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Siphokazi, The Soil, Sipho “HotStix” Mabuse and Stimela will set the stage on fire from 26–28 September at Sandton Convention Centre in Joburg. Founder Peter Tladi said every year, they strive to attract new audiences and develop the festival. He said: “This is not possible without showing jazz’s ability to grow. “It was important to mark 25 years of our South African democracy with a collaboration between Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center organisatiom in the US. “It gives us a global footprint. This is important for the role the festival plays in cultural exchange.” The performers include Nomfundo Xaluva, who will be collaborating with Zoe Modiga on the event called Ladies Unite in Jazz. Nofundo said she was excited to be part of the Joy of Jazz family. She said jazz is like a tradition that people pass on and it was great to pay tribute to those who came before them. “I have been part of the festival for eight years now. It is always a great feeling to be linked to such a quality event. “I am looking forward to our performance. “It means a lot because jazz has always been dominated by men and it will be a great pleasure to be the voice for women. “We are assuming our rightful place, following in the footsteps of Miriam Makeba, Abigail Kubheka and Dorothy Masuku, and carrying on their legacy.”
