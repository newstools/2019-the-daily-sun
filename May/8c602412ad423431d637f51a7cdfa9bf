Rugby player Tendai 'Beast' Mtawarira got big surprise while being interviewed on Supersport. Beast was being interviewed by Lalla Hirayama and being congratulated for reaching 157 caps. Hirayama told beast that “we also want to kind of get into the mood of congratulating you...we also hear that you a fan of standup comedy....so in light of that we decided to reach out to the most funniest and the most famous person we all know and he has a couple of words that he want to share with you.” And then a video message from Mzansi’s funniest comedian stared playing on the screen. "Yo Tendai…congratulations on the 157 caps man…To say you are a beast is an understatement. I don't even know what you call a beast with stamina my friend because a beast has power but a beast with stamina is something new," said Noah.
