SIBONISO Gaxa has threatened to spill the beans about his former club Kaizer Chiefs. The 35-year-old former Chiefs player says he has a "bomb" for the way his contract was terminated by the Soweto giants. The former Bafana Bafana defender, who joined Chiefs in 2012 after he ended his short spell at Lierse SK in Belgium, left the club in 2016 under a dark cloud. Gaxa claims that he was released unfairly while he still had an existing contract with Amakhosi. The case was lodged to Safa's arbitration but it has been dragging for a long time with no resolution. But Gaxa is still baffled of the way he was shown the door despite helping the club win two league titles, MTN8, and Nedbank Cup. He said one day he will reveal everything, and it will be mind-blowing. Said Gaxa: "I'm going to drop one of the biggest bombs ever in this country. We need to change how football is run in South Africa, it can't be run like this. "Obviously, I still have a case against them (Chiefs) and it's still existence. “But I don't want to dwell too much on that at the moment. I am going to drop a bomb one day and  that bomb will be a sign of a change."
