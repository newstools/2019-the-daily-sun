“LEAVE your husband and you’ll live in peace!” This was one of many SMSes Fihliwe Mahlangu received from a stalker. The 46-year-old from Devon, outside Springs in Ekurhuleni, said she had been receiving threatening messages for two weeks. “In some of the messages, she claims she’s dating my husband. “And in others she threatens the lives of my family members. She’s also threatening to kidnap my daughter.” One of the messages, seen by the SunTeam, reads: “The lives of your family members are in your hands.” Fihliwe’s sister Anna (56) said she also received messages from the stalker. Fihilwe said the problem started in December when the stalker offered her husband buscuits at a funeral. Her husband Andries Maaboi said he knew the stalker as she lives in the area. “I know her but we’re not dating and we never dated,” he said. Andries said he had to get a protection order. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed the woman was served with a protection order.
