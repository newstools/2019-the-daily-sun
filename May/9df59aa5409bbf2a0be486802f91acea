HE SAID neighbours are sick and tired of his prayers! They have accused him of making a lot of noise and of insulting them. But Joseph Tsholotse (39) from Tshepisong, west of Joburg, said all his neighbours want is his stand. Joseph claimed they even stole his title deeds. That’s why, he said, he has resorted to prayers – he believes only God will fight for him. “They have my papers, and I’m afraid they’ll sell my property. “When I pray out loud, people say I’m making a noise. I praise and worship God the way I see fit.” Joseph said he’s afraid of leaving his house for more than a day as he fears finding himself homeless. He said his neighbours once stole his belongings while he was out looking for a job. But one of the neighbours said no one is trying to sell his property or wants him out. She said the papers were given to a neighbour by Joseph’s family after his sister died. “This property belonged to his late sister, and the family were afraid he’d sell it,” the neighbour told Daily Sun. She said Joseph had once called the neighbourhood committee to ask for the papers, and the neighbour who had them gave them back to him. “He adds insults when he prays and makes so much noise,” said the neighbour.
