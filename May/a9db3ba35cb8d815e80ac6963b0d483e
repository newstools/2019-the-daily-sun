ACCORDING to Simphiwe Tetani, God gave him the power to help troubled people. The security guard from Siyanyanzela squatter camp in Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun he used to be a security guard but quit his job due to an injury. “I think I was injured because I wasn’t taking the calling from God and my ancestors seriously. I decided to follow my calling and now I help sick people and those with marital problems. This is the gift I got from God and the ancestors and I learned to respect it.” Simphiwe said he didn’t use muthi but only anointing water. When the SunTeam arrived at his house, the long queue of people waiting to see him included a 32-year-old from Gauteng, who said: “My ancestors showed me baba Tetani. I saw a man who wears spectacles. “I got his number from the dream and when I called him, he gave me directions. ” The man said after three days of visiting Simphiwe, he started seeing results. “I developed a problem with my 4-5 last year. Nothing helped. After only three days of being here, it started looking strong again,” he said. He said someone used muthi to weaken his 4-5 but he was happy it was working again.
