THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) transfer window only officially opens on 1 July‚ but there have already been some intriguing moves that are on the cards ahead of the new season. SunSport can confirm that Orlando Pirates have acquired the services of Chippa United left-back Tebogo "Messi" Tlolane. Tlolane, who joined The Chilli Boys at the begging of the season from National First Division (NFD) side Jomo Cosmos, signed a three-year deal with the Buccaneers. The deal could see Linda Mtambo, who joined Bucs at the start of 2018-19 campaign, returning to Chippa on a loan basis. The indication from informants close to these two PSL clubs suggests that the Port Elizabeth outfit is likely to get more players from the Soweto giants, as part of the relationship between the two clubs. They have been working as a unit during the PSL transfer window and are  expected to continue their good working relationship seen in recent seasons, with more deals likely to take place when the window period opens in July. Said the informant: “Pirate and Chippa are continuing with their relationship that we have seen in the past transfer period. Messi (Tlolane) has joined Pirates on a three-year deal. "He is not going back to Port Elizabeth. “His move will see Figo, (Mntambo) returning to The Chilli Boys on loan." The 24-year-old Tlolane joined Chippa from Cosmos as a midfielder, but was converted to a left back by then coach Eric Tinkler as his preferred left wing position was star studded with the likes of Thabo Rakhale and Mark Mayambela. Tlolane was also targeted by SuperSport United. He will be joining Bucs next month when they start with pre-season alongside Fortune Makaringe who will be joining from Maritzburg United once they are done with the promotional/relegation play-offs. Meanwhile, Mamelodi Sundowns are also believed to be in negotiations with Kaizer Chiefs as they are eyeing Kabelo Mahlasela in a swap deal which will see Jeremy Brockie joining Amakhosi.
