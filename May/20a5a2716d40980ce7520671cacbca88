POPULAR painter Rasta wants Mzansi to know he has nothing to do with a terrible painting of President Cyril Ramaphosa. The painting in Taung, North West, has made the rounds on social media. Rasta took to Twitter yesterday, denying it was his. He said: “Guys, this has nothing do with me.” But Rasta, who’s known for his controversial paintings, didn’t convince his followers. Many said they knew a Rasta original when they saw one. - @AndiMakhana tweeted: “If ayinguwe lo, then you have multiplied Mhlekazi.” - @Emmanuel_Tsebe said: “Rasta, are you sure this is not your handwriting?” - @mis_tourist said the painting had Rasta painted all over it. “He might as well admit it, even if he says it’s not his. The painting is him and he’s the painting.” Rasta also teaches people how to paint, so many people thought whoever painted the mural was one of his students. - @Kabza_the_1st tweeted: “One of your students then. I mean an apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.” - @rmgmonene said: “If it is not you, it is your apprentice. You taught him well.” People thought instead of distancing himself from the piece, Rasta should be proud that his style was inspiring others. - @Vutomy said: “You’re multiplying, Ras.”
