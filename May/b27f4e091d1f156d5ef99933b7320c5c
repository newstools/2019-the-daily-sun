 A fire broke out on Monday at the Bheki Mlangeni Hospital in
Jabulani Soweto, forcing patients to be relocated to nearby hospitals. Gauteng Health spokesperson, Lesemang Matuka said that a staff
member observed the appearance of smoke, they then alerted security to check
where the smoke was emerging. This was when the fire department was called and they responded
immediately and managed to extinguish the fire. “The smoke that was spreading throughout the hospital led to the
immediate evacuation of patients and all staff members” Matuka said.  According to Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson Robert
Mulaudzi early on Monday morning there was a fire incident reported at the
hospital. Malaudzi said that the fire affected the hospital's HR
administration block. “No injuries were reported during the fire incident,” Mulaudzi
said Matuka said as a precautionary measure, the Gauteng Department of
Health moved patients from the Bheki Mlangeni District Hospital in Soweto. Matuka said that the fire was under control around 8:00 AM one and
a half hour after it was first reported. "All patients in the hospital were safely evacuated and some

Academic Hospital, Southrand Hospital, Rahima Mother and Child, Sterkforntein
and Lenasia South District Hospital," Matuka said. A total of 86 patients were relocated including, 13 psychiatric
patients, 2 antenatal patients and 6 neonatal patients.  "Bheki Mlangeni hospital is currently on divert and we would
to like appeal to the health users to utilise surrounding healthcare facilities
till further notice. The hospital has paused all duties and the building can’t be
occupied by patients and staff members until the smoke has completely
cleared," Matuka said. Matuka explained that the cause of the fire was unknown.
