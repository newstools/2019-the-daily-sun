THE Gauteng police are making life difficult for thugs in the province. Yesterday the police pounced on three different areas of Joburg to bust those breaking the law. They went to Cleveland, Kensington and the CBD. In the city centre, they found fong kong goods worth more than R1 million in a Jeppe Street flat. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun they found four people in unroadworthy vehicles. “They were also found to be in the country illegally.” He said they entered Denver hostel and found many dangerous weapons. “We want to clean Joburg and we have faith that we will win that battle,” said Makhubele. He said the raids were part of the O Kae Molau operation which started last year. “The operation continues to yield positive results. “With this operation, we want to make the space very small for criminals.” He said the operation was led by community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane and provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela. When cops confiscated the fake goods in the CBD, shop owners were seen watching from the street. Makhubele said all their operations were intelligence’ driven. “When we come for illegal goods, we know exactly what to look for. When we find the doors locked, we gain entry and confiscate all the counterfeit goods.” He said they monitored the shops to make sure the people who fled didn’t return to continue operating.
