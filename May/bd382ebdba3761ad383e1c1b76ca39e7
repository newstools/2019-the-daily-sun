NAMIBIAN Helalia Johannes is on track to winning 2019 edition of the Spar Grand Prix after collecting her second 30 points in a row when she won the Cape Town 10km Women’s race in a credible time on Sunday. The flat Mother City route course made her running easier where the 38-year-old from Oshana Region, recorded another best time by showing her competitors a clean pair of heels, leading from start at the Greenpoint Stadium until the finish line. The Nedbank Running Club athlete, who crossed the line in 31 minutes 45 second – five seconds better than her Port Elizabeth time, opened up an eight seconds distance gap between herself and Sofia Chegen who was breathing heavily behind her neck towards the eighth kilometre mark. Chegen, who hails from Ethiopia, finished the race in 32:02 while Johannes’ team mate Tadu Teshome Nare was third to cross the line in 32:56. Helalia, the reigning 2019 Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon women’s champion in 1:10:29, registered her biggest achievement last year when she won the Gold Coast Marathon during the Commonwealth Games in Australia where she finished in 2:32:40. Johannes said her next big race is the IAAF World Championships in Doha in  September, but she will back at the Spar on 23 June.Sunday's race attracted about 27 000 enthusiastic runners but only 20 000 could be registered, with the rest turned away. The race start was delayed by 15 minutes due to a road accident on the race route, and logistics could not allow for a new route to be changed.
