THE community is still searching for the body of a 24-year-old man who drowned in Hombe Dam in Lusikisiki last Tuesday. They’ve been visiting the dam as early as 6am to search for the body. Nokonwaba Gwiji (45) told Daily Sun they were losing hope. “He drowned at about 12pm, but the rescue team only came at night and couldn’t do anything,” she said. She said the man was swimming with his friend when he drowned. “We didn’t know it would take this long for his body to be found,” said Nokonwaba. “We had faith the body will be found when the rescue team came with dogs, but it was not to be.” One of the community members said he believes there are evil spirits in the dam. He said it wouldn’t have taken this long for the body to be found if it had been a normal drowning. “We’ve never seen anything like this before and are still shocked.” Daily Sun recently published a story about the community asking for the local dam to be fenced. When the SunTeam contacted the ward councillor about residents’ request, he said they were trying their best to get the dam fenced in. Zilungile Ngcamu (56) said: “We were concerned about kids, but the victim is old enough to know how to swim.” Ward 20 councillor Sihle Ndarane joined the community in searching for the body.
