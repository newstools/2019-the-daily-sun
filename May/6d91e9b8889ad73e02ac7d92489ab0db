MZANSI will be heading for the polls tomorrow. Celebrities are saying voting is important as it gives people a voice. TV personality Bonang Matheba said she would be up at 6am to go and vote.“I encourage everyone to do the same. This is your opportunity to also have your say.” Durban house and gqom music tycoon DJ Tira said: “I will be voting tomorrow. This is our chance to choose who we want to lead us.”  He said young people who said they wouldn’t vote should have a re-think.“Voting does help. It brings change. Sometimes change comes slowly but it comes. If it hasn’t reached you, have faith.” But he wouldn’t reveal who he would vote for. Zahara, whose real name is Bulelwa Mkutukana, said: “I am certainly voting. It is my right to do so.” She said people should do the same as it was the right thing to do.  Rapper Kwesta, whose real name is Mfundo Vilakazi, said he too would vote. “If you don’t vote, you will always cry for change, which you never even tried to contribute towards.” Gospel star Deborah Fraser said: “It’s a sure thing that I am voting.” She said people should use this opportunity to put those their trust in place. Activist and businessman Thami Kotlolo said he voted yesterday. For him, it meant exercising his rights.
