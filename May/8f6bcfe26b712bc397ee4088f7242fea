IT was a happy day for about 200 RDP houses owners from Siyathuthuka in Emakhazeni. They finally received title deeds for their houses. Mayor Thomas Ngwenya, from Emakhazeni Municipality, handed over the documents. The ceremony was held recently at Entokozweni Community Hall. The mayor urged people to be patient with government. He said government was trying its level best to give dignity to the citizens of the country. “We have a long road ahead of us as we strive for full realisation of the hopes of the Freedom Charter. Government is determined and committed to see everyone owning a property. Patience becomes virtue. “House owners will now live in peace knowing the houses belong to them legally and no one can ever chase them out. These special papers must be kept safe,” he said. Gogos Eva Zondi (71) and Josephine Mgwenya (65) said: “These papers make us to be complete human beings. We now believe the houses indeed belong to us.” The municipality is on an issuing drive. It hopes to issue about 15 000 title deeds in the province during this financial year.
