ALTHOUGH the municipality recently started moving them to permanent stands, the shack dwellers are not happy about the long wait. Residents of Lethabong in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, have been living on a wetland since 2010 and are gatvol. Although some of them were moved on Tuesday when the reallocation process started, many were unhappy. Resident Oupa Mahlangu (45) said they started getting notices on their shacks on Saturday. “We’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time, but the allocation process is too slow,” he said. Oupa said the problem was that the area they were moved to was not clean at all. “We’re tired of suffering. We’ve lived on wetlands without electricity or clean water for a long time.” Oupa said they were tired of getting water from JoJo tanks. Residents said their lives had been difficult since they moved in 2010. Councillor Rebone Maleka confirmed residents were being moved to permanent stands. “But the process is too slow as they’re moving 10 people at a time,” said Maleka. Maleka said residents had been made to live on the wetland for far too long. She said 184 households would be moved to new stands.
