After Babes Wodumo went live on Instagram while being beaten
by her boyfriend Mampintsha, questions arose about why Babes was still with
him. Daily Sun spoke to
relationship expert Tamara Sosa about why it is difficult to leave an abusive
relationship. Tamara said that abusive relationships are extremely complex
in nature, where there is a cycle of abuse. “Abusive relationships often start with an idyllic and
honeymoon stage which set the stage for future expectations,” she said. “Often in the cycle of abuse, the abuser will return to
glimpses of this idyllic phase keeping the other partner engaged and in hope
that the abuse will end. “This often occurs when the abused person detaches or begins
to leave the relationship or attachment in some way. “The abuser then promises to change or things will be
different but it is usually short lived.” Tamara also said that abusive relationships lead to various
forms of psychological and emotional problems. “The effects of abusive relationships are far reaching
spanning from depression and anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, traumatic
stress, fear, hopelessness, guilt and shame, mood disturbances, eating and
sleeping problems, nightmare disturbances, social withdrawal, isolation and
relationship problems outside of the abusive relationship,” she said.
