SLEEP is critical, not only to our basic survival but to our overall health and wellbeing. An ongoing lack of sleep will lead to short and long-term health problems. The best defence is to find a sleep solution that works for you. Dr Erik St Louis, co-director of the Mayo Centre for Sleep Medicine in Rochester, New York, in the United States, said that getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night is an important factor for a healthy body and mind. “Research shows that the brain needs enough sleep to wash away toxins that accumulate while we are awake – toxins that can potentially damage older brains.” Good quality sleep contributes to aging well – physically and mentally. Good sleep during youth and middle age reduces the risk of obesity and hypertension. It also protects against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease later in life. Regular sleep has even been attributed to fewer signs of aging in facial skin and better tissue tone – the idea of beauty sleep is not a myt.! Sleep hygiene Sleep hygiene is a routine people can adopt to improve their sleep quality. It should be adapted to the needs of the individual but here are some basics. - Have a fixed bedtime and waking time. - Keep your daytime naps to 45 minutes or fewer. - Avoid alcohol and smoking at least four hours before bed. - Avoid caffeine –even in tea and cold drinks – six hours before bed. - Avoid heavy, spicy and sugary foods four hours before bed. - Use a quality mattress and pillow. - Keep the room ventilated and at a comfortable temperature. - Block out all distracting noise and as much light as possible. Sleep needs a quality mattress. Cheap mattresses cost less but you will pay the difference in the sleep you lose.
