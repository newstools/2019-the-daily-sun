COPS are looking for a missing mum and her two-year-old son! They have been missing since the beginning of February. Police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said cops have opened missing persons cases. She said Prudence Mohlala (28) and her son Phethego Mohlala (2) lived at 120 Berggrass Street in Westview, Tshwane, at the time of their disappearance. The two were last seen by a neighbour on 2 February at about 3.30pm. Prudence’s mother Betty (56) said Prudence was wearing a floral skirt and brown top, while Phethego was wearing a red tracksuit. “We’re very stressed as we don’t know where they are,” said Betty. She told police her daughter was leaving for Limpopo. Betty even contacted family in Limpopo, but no one saw them. Vuma said her boyfriend said he did not see them and they were not with him. Police are appealing to anyone with information to contact Vuma on 082 822 8316 or Betty on 082 212 5055 or 072 178 8269.
