THE two men pretended to be shopping. But they ended up shooting the shopkeepers. The thugs entered a store in extension 3, Nellmapius, near Mamelodi at 7pm on Tuesday. Onlookers said the men demanded money. A scuffle broke out and bullets started flying. A resident who was at the shop said she was lucky to be alive. She said the scuffle started as she was paying for bread. “I thought it would be sorted out, but I knew it was serious when guns came out,” she said. She said people fled when they heard gunshots, but regrouped after a few minutes. Another resident, Mathews Mokoena, said the two shopkeepers were not moving when they went to check on them. “After the thugs fled, we rushed to the shop. It was clear they were dead. “We called the police,” he said. Silverton police spokesman, Captain Jan Sepato, said two Somali men, aged 24 and 25, were shot and killed. He said no goods or money was taken from the spaza shop. “We are investigating cases of murder and appeal to anyone who might have information regarding the two suspects to contact their nearest police station.”
