Durban Specialised Commercial Crime Court has sentenced 47-year-old
Mex Dhladhla to twelve years in jail for fraud. Dhladhla was arrested by the Hawks in 2015 along with
accomplices, Nokwazi Chule (32), Hlengiwe Hlela (34), after investigations
revealed that they defrauded the Department of Corporate Governance and
Traditional Affairs (COGTA) of R7.5 million. They reportedly illegally transfered R7.5 million into a
bank account held by Imvusa Trading, where Dhladhla was a sole signatory. These funds were meant for development at a local community
centre in Bulwer which falls under Ingwe Municipality, but ended up in
Dhladhlaâ€™s account where a series of withdrawals took place within a two weeks
period. Investigations further revealed that some of the money was
transferred to Chule and Hlela who were working for the department at that time. Police spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovhasays the case
against Chule and Hlela, who remain out on bail has been postponed to the 10th
of April 2019.
