RESIDENTS of Freedom Park, Soweto, want to be free from the plague of crime. They marched to Eldorado Park Police Station and demanded that officers take action. Their memorandum of grievances was accepted by an official from the office of the Community Safety MEC, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane. Residents claimed officers at the police station were not solving crimes in the area. One of the worst crimes the police were accused of not solving was the murder of former councillor Mbuyiseni Dokolwane. He was shot outside his home three years ago. Community leader Cuthbert Sigaqa claimed the officers did not patrol at night. He also accused them of using patrol vehicles to visit their girlfriends. “The streets are dangerous at night. Shop owners are attacked and when the crimes are reported, nothing is done,” he said. Sigaqa said the officers needed to increase their visibility in the neighbourhood. “When you call the police they arrive five hours later,” he said. Resident Thobile Zondo said the situation was extremely frustrating. “We don’t know who killed the councillor and we need answers,” said Thobile. One resident said: “Cops visit the gym while people are dying. They don’t seem to be interested in our safety.” Another resident said if the police did not play their part in the fight against crime, they would close down the cop shop. He said: “If the police station is not doing anything, then we might as well close it.”
