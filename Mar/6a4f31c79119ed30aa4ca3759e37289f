AS the 21-year-old stood on the edge of the building
threatening to jump, a crowd gathered. But instead of trying to save him, people in the crowd
whipped out their cellphones and encouraged him to “Jump! Jump!”. Seconds later, the crowd’s laughter turned to screams as
horror as the student jumped to his death. According to Coconuts, this shocking incident happened
last Friday at a four-storey mall in indonesia’s Lampung province. An eyewitness known only as Heni told Kompas that most in
the crowd were only interested in getting footage of the drama on their cellphones
instead of rushing to his rescue. “I even saw up there on the rooftop a man who was wearing
black. I thought he was negotiating with the victim so he wouldn’t commit
suicide, but he was actually among those who took pictures,” Heni said. Photos and videos posted online of the suicide have
caused outrage about the crowd’s apparent lack of humanity. They may also as evidence against the witnesses. Knowingly
not helping a person in danger is punishable by three months in prison in
Indonesia. So far, there are no reports that local cops have taken
any action.
