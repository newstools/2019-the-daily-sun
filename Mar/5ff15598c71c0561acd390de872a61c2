A couple from Florida in the US decided to lose weight together before their wedding and they lost 90 KGS combined. Mary Jane and husband Alex O’ Toole from Florida, US, embarked on their weight loss journey after a trip to Disney’s Animal Kingdom two years ago, Pop Sugar reports. The couple used their upcoming wedding as motivation to lose weight and tracked everything they ate. Alex reportedly lost 75 pounds (around 34 kg) in his first year and Mary Jane, whose main motivation was to fit in her wedding dress, lost 135 pounds (61 kg) in two years. The newlywed told WKMG News6 that she manages her diet by focusing on the number of portions she eats daily. "I just make sure to log what I'm eating, whether it's rice cakes or Rice Krispy treats, into the Lose It app to help keep my portion sizes under control and help me stay on track to achieve my goals," she said. ?? #lover #sunday #dinerdate A post shared by  Mary Jane (@maryjaneotoole) on Sep 6, 2015 at 8:41am PDT  Last Saturday ?????? #funkybuddah #boyfriend #vacation A post shared by  Mary Jane (@maryjaneotoole) on Aug 1, 2016 at 5:35pm PDT  I’m back!! Took a bit of time off leading up to the wedding but here it is! I’m in a dress I NEVER thought I would be able to wear. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• I must have tried on at least 20 dresses before I decided on this one. At first, I thought I wanted a dress with a bigger skirt to conceal what I’m the most insecure about. Shopping 8 months out from the wedding meant I needed a dress that could be easily altered. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• This dress, although so tight in places my rubs felt bruised the next day, gave me so much confidence. I have along way to go in the self esteem department, but I have to say - this dress helped push me. I was going to wear 3 types of spandex to hold me in and flatten out all my loose skin. I had some with butt pads and at one point considered a corset. In the end - I wore @spanx that were 2 sizes too big just so I could be smoothed out and not squished. That’s it. Always going to try to love myself more. (My groom, who I did @loseitapp with is down 75lbs and met his goal summer 2017). •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• #instadaily #transformation #fitnessgirl #fitness #motivation #postworkout #glow #girlswhoworkout #eatwhatyouwant #lifechanges #ilovefood #blogger #instafit #wedding #weddingdress #lifestyle #biggirl #fitgirl #thennowtomorrow #brideandgroom #OOTD #yoga #inspiration #26 #seventhanniversary #lifelongjourney #wine #married A post shared by  Mary Jane (@then_now_tomorrow) on Nov 21, 2018 at 2:08pm PST  We did a thing ?? #charleston #destinationwedding #married A post shared by  Mary Jane (@maryjaneotoole) on Nov 20, 2018 at 10:31am PST
