THE 27-year-old man who allegedly raped women in Pinetown, west of Durban, after promising them jobs is likely to face more rape charges. The accused appeared briefly yesterday in the Pinetown Magistrates Court on a rape charge. He was arrested at work on 14 February after it was reported that he raped a 25-year-old woman on the M19 highway in January and robbed her of her belongings. The defence team asked the court to give them time to consult with their client. Prosecutor Veraysha Moodley said more charges are likely to be added when the case continues. Moodley said the matter has been postponed to 8 March to give the defence team time to consult their client. It’s not clear when the man raped the women, but there are a number of cases dating from 2017 until this year. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the victim that was raped on 20 January was tied up. After she was untied by residents, she reported the matter to the cops. “It’s possible he might be involved in other rape cases committed along the highway,” said Mbele. She said the accused promised women jobs and asked them to meet him at a certain location where he would then rape them. “We’re pleading with all the victims in this case to come forward and report to the investigating officer,” said Mbele.
