A SERVICE delivery protest in Umzimkhulu, southern KZN, claimed the life of a resident on Thursday. Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda announced this on Friday. Two residents were shot at, allegedly by people in a passing minibus taxi. The protesting residents said their grievances included water shortages and escalating crime. “We want to offer our heartfelt condolences. “Our prayers are with the family during this time of bereavement,” said Kaunda. He said provincial government would tackle residents’ service delivery concerns. Kaunda said a team of government officials was busy consolidating responses to all the issues raised by residents. He said they would receive feedback before the end of the week. “While we are attending to the genuine service delivery challenges raised by the community, I have asked the police to conduct a thorough investigation into the murder of a community member and arrest all those implicated in the damage of property.”
