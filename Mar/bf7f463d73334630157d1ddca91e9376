BOITUMELO Moholo (34) from Dryharts, near Taung in North West, said he was almost killed by his boss’ dogs. Boitumelo said on 11 February he was about to open the gate at work when the dogs attacked him. “They went for my throat, but I made sure they didn’t get me. “The boss’ wife screamed from the car but didn’t get out.” Boitumelo said he was already covered in blood when the boss finally managed to call off the dogs. His legs, elbows, back, cheeks and 4-5 were bleeding. “The boss took me to the doctor, where I got stitches. I don’t have an ID so I can’t get another job,” said Boitumelo. “He pays my salary in cash. When my colleagues and I are sick, he offers to treat us at his home. “A woman had her breast bitten off by the dog and he didn’t seem to care.” When the SunTeam contacted the boss for a comment, he said: “No, man. Don’t talk sh*t!” Police spokesman Sam Tselanyane said: “Nothing indicates that he intentionally set the dogs on the complainant, so we can’t arrest him. “After getting the farmer’s statement, we will send the docket to the prosecutor for a decision.”
