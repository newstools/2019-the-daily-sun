IZIMPOHLWA ezincane (young bachelors) is the label which is causing chaos at Isibonelo High School in KwaMashu, KZN. There’s been violence at the school since January, allegedly involving pupils called izimpohlwa ezincane from the kasi and KwaMashu Hostel. Worried parents said the name was allegedly used to belittle young men. “They calmed down for a while, but then continued.” He said they were now calling for the education department to intervene, and for more security guards and police to patrol around the school.“Otherwise our kids will be killed.” KZN Education spokesman Scelo Khuzwayo said: “We signed a memorandum with police to say when a school is troubled by violence, they will offer security services. “We request the school to call its nearest cop shop.” In 2015 Daily Sun ran a story about Nhlakanipho Ncanana, who was allegedly stabbed to death by a pupil from the hostel, while Lungani Mbatha (20) was hit with a brick.
