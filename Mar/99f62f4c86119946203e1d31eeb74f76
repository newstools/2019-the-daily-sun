THE OUTCRY by local residents of Polokwane to the Limpopo
police about the gruesome murder of Thorisho Themane (28) who was allegedly
attacked and killed by a gang has yielded positive results. Residents of Polokwane marched to the police station on
Friday to demand more arrests in the murder and an end to gangsterism. They screamed with
joy when Limpopo Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba announced
to them that two more boys and a girl, who are also under age, were arrested in
the early hours of Friday adding the number to nine suspects. “With the information we are getting from the community,
more arrests are expected linked to the alleged crime committed. And the three
that was arrested will appear before the court within 48 hours.  We have done our job and thankful to the community for
giving the police intelligence the valuable information” said Ledwaba. Ledwaba further confirmed that the arrested nine suspects
are behind bars and not kept at any place of safety. Murdered Thabiso will be laid to rest on Saturday at his
home in Flora-Park, Polokwane. Leader of the march Tony Rachuene said that the nine
suspects arrested is not enough. “In our memorandum we have mentioned that people who are
selling sweets on the street corners of the suburbs and townships must also
operate with a license because they are pretending to be selling sweets while
they supplying drugs to their children. “Our outcry had an impact since the death. We have been
complaining to the police that the suspects are incomplete and we are glad with
the recent arrest made. We have hope that within seven days our memorandum will
positively replied” he said. The protesters were also joined by a group of bikers from
SAPA YOPA on their arrival at the Polokwane police station.
