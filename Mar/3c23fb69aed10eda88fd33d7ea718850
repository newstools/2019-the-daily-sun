LUNGELO Gumede (32) told Daily Sun the sculpture of former mother of the nation Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is only one of many he’s made. “The plan is to open the first wax museum in the country,” said the artist from Ndwedwe, near Inanda, KZN. He said he has made about 100 sculptures so far, including some of politicians, religious leaders, kings and queens, soccer players and musicians. “I am working at getting a building and then the museum will be up and running.” Lungelo said his passion for art started when he was at school. “I always had a pencil in my hand.” He said in 2004, he was given a bursary to study fine art at Durban University of Technology. He said when he visited Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in New York in the US, he got the idea of creating wax sculptures. Once he started making them, the response was encouraging. He has made sculptures of Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and many others. “My sculptures are meant to educate while entertaining people. It is important to educate our kids. When they are near the statues, they can feel the presence of those people.” He said he also teaches people sculpture. “Some have even started to do their own projects.” Lungelo said it took him three to four weeks to finish a sculpture. Mongezi Zwane (49) got a chance to see Lungelo’s sculpture of Mama Winnie. “When you are near it, you feel like you are standing next to her,” Mongezi said.
