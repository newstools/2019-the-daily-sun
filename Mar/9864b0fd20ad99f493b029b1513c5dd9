SOUTH African-born Lovemore “The Black Panther” Ndou will be inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame in Melbourne on Saturday. Ndou, who was born in Mesina in Limpopo, left Mzansi more than two decades ago to pursue his boxing career on foreign soil. In 1995, he went to Australia to fight the local unbeaten prospect Cliff Sarmardin and lost on points. The following year, the hard-hitting warrior packed his bags and headed for a permanent stay in Australia. In his illustrious boxing career, he has won the IBF junior-welterweight title and the IBO and WBF welterweight world titles. Other minor belts he has won include the IBF Pan Pacific, OPBF junior-welterweight, and IBF Pan Pacific welterweight titles until he retired in 2012. In an outstanding career, he compiled a record of 49-13-2 (31 KO’s). For his contribution to the Australian sport, he will be inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame together with a local hero Shannan Taylor at the Pullman hotel in Melbourne, Victoria. He will be inducted on international category, while Taylor would be on Modern category. The retired fighter, who is a practising lawyer in Sydney, New South Wales, has shared the ring with world class fighters such as Sharmba Mitchell, Miguel Cotto, Junior Witter, and Naoufel Ben Rahbah. He also gave Cotto one of his toughest fights and battled Saul Alvarez and Kell Brook in 12 round championship bouts. Phillip “Time Bomb” Ndou said he is pleased that his former opponent has been recognised for his contribution. “I’m pleased that his contribution in sport has been acknowledged. The sad part though is that his country of birth, South Africa, didn’t honour him. In South Africa they only honour a person when he is no more.”
