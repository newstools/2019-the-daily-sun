Hawks have arrested six suspects linked to
the heroine bust worth R10 million. This was after the Hawks found R10-million
worth of suspected heroine on Saturday. Hawks member captain Matimba
Maleke, said they found heroine in a house that looked like any other in the
quiet neighborhood. Matimba said this normal looking home in
Birchleigh North turned out to be a suspected drug warehouse. According to Matimba, the bust on the
corner of Oscar Street and Shirley Road was the result of an operation aimed at
solving the surge of drugs across the country. “We have arrested six suspects between the
ages of 22 and 42,” he said. Matimba said these arrests took place
across the Kempton Park and Edenvale areas. He said some took place in houses, while
other suspects were arrested on the street for dealing drugs. “I encourage residents to inform the police
of such crimes so that we can put a stop to it,” said Matimba.
