NONE of us want to poke when we’re groaning with tummy
ache, but there’s more to the relationship between your gut and your sex life
than that. Here are three other ways that things going on in your
tummy influences your desire whether or not you poke, according to Bustle: 1. It’s where serotonin
is made Many people think that serotonin is produced in the
brain, because it’s a body chemical related to mood and depression. Too little
of it and you’ll really feel blue. But serotonin is also produced in your tummy and
regulates bowel movements and feelings of nausea. Serotonin also has a role to play in how much sex we
have. According to Scientific American: "Generally speaking, high levels
of serotonin inhibit sexual behavior. This means that antidepressants which
increase serotonin cause problems like longer time to ejaculate in men.” 2. Gut bacteria can
cause infections A urinary tract infection (UTI) can make sex really
painful, and this has a very direct link to what’s going on in your tummy.
According to Washington University School of Medicine: "Most UTIs are
caused by E. coli that live in the gut and spread to the urinary tract." E.coli also does a lot of positive things for the body,
but when it gets to the wrong place, all hell breaks loose. 3. What’s going on
in our tummy makes us sexy All the tiny organisms – or microbes – living in your gut
are vital for your health. In fact, microbiologist Susan Erdman, told the New
York Times that evidence of health like the glow of skin and hair depends on happy
organisms in your tummy. This is the “attraction factor”. Some scientists also have a theory that attraction
between people also depends on whether the microbe population in the two people’s
guts match or not. If they do, it’s more likely the two will enjoy a positive
attraction.
