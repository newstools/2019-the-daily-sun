GATVOL community members in Eldorado and surrounding areas outside Bochum, Limpopo removed nurses from Ratshaatshaa Community Health Centre and closed it down on Monday. Patients were not allowed to enter the centre and according to community members, the situation will continue until the MEC listens to them. They used burning tyres to barricade the road leading to the main gate of the centre. Residents say there’s a shortage of staff at the centre. They say there are no doctors, no accommodation for nurses, no laundry facilities and no mortuary. They are angry that no one from top management in the district is willing to address their challenges. Clinic committee member Dinah Mpashi said they are tired of empty promises. “We have reported the challenges experienced at this centre but since 2013 promises have been made but no action taken. We can’t continue like this. “As the committee and members of the community, we approached a mining company to assist us with funds but the department refused to give us the greenlight,” said Dinah. Limpopo Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana condemned the action, saying people had no right to close down the institution. “It is wrong to close down the clinic because they have grievances. They should direct their grievances to the relevant people. Our job is to ensure that people are assisted at all times at our health facilities.”
