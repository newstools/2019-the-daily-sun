IF THERE is one match that Eric Tinkler would want to win with Maritzburg United this season, then it must be against AmaZulu in their KZN derby, scheduled for Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night (8pm). He is aware that defeat or draw would see the train drift away from his charges, leaving them to dry at the foot of the PSL table, ultimately subjecting them to relegation. The Team of Choice are grappling for every point to quickly turn things around. They are on 14 points from 21 games played – five points behind 15th placed Free State Stars, with nine league games to go. Said Tinkler: “We have to be at our best against AmaZulu.” An area of concern for Tinkler is his players’ temper and has urged them to resist provocation.
