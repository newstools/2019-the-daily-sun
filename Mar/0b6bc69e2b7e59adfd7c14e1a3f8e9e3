THE operation to recover the remaining bodies trapped at Gloria Coal Mine in Koornfontein near Middleburg, Mpumalanga, was halted again on Wednesday. According to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, the operation was suspended due to the volatility of the areas being searched. “Apparently there are big rocks falling and the area is flooded with water. “We call on those who were in the mine prior to the tragedy to come forth and share some light so we can know where these bodies might be.” The operation resumed on Monday with officials hoping to find the remaining bodies that are still unaccounted for. The Gupta-owned mine was rocked by an underground gas explosion on 6 February, allegedly after a group of illegal miners entered it to strip copper cables. The rescue team managed to recover 12 bodies, and one live person, in the past weeks. Thirteen bodies were discovered in the early hours of last Friday morning, bringing the death toll to 25. The team had on several occasions been forced to suspend the mission after methane gas continued to build up in the mine shafts. Ventilation appliances were installed to clear the area of methane and the flammable gases underground were brought down to manageable levels.
