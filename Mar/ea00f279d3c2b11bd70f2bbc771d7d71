BLACKHILL Primary teacher (30) Fikile Nkambule from eMalahleni, Mpumalanga was granted bail of R2 000 by the Magistrates Court in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga on Monday. She was suspended and arrested for allegedly locking a six -year-old grade one pupil in the school’s strong room for the night and forgetting him there till the next day. The incident was reported to have happened last Wednesday, when the boy was locked in the store room for almost 17 hours. After his parents spent a sleepless night, they went to the school the next day to report the missing boy. It was then revealed that the teacher had left him in the storeroom. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane told Daily Sun: “His parents got worried when he didn’t arrive home at the usual time. “They searched in vain and reported the matter to the police. “The next morning, they went to the school to report it, only to be told the teacher had forgotten him in the strong room.” Zwane said the department has launched an investigation to probe the circumstances that led to the incident and will arrange for counselling for the pupil and his family. He said they condemn the incident and will do everything possible to ensure justice is served. Waya Waya movement leader Lucas Mtsweni said on Thursday afternoon a resident informed him of the incident. He called it irresponsible and reckless. “She should have punished him in a different way. We will monitor the progress in this matter to ensure the wellbeing of this child is not compromised.”
