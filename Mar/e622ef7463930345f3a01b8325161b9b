THERE were smiles and celebrations when 54 girls from Impendulo Primary School in Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, received sanitary pads on Friday. Thandi Ngobeni (24), the founder of Yellow Lemon Juice, told Daily Sun their organisation aims to make a positive contribution. She said the organisation, which was formed last year, donates necessities such as sanitary pads, food, uniform, cosmetics and stationery. “We know that most girls struggle to go to school during their periods,” said Thandi. “It’s our duty to ensure these girls are always in school. “Education is the key to their success.” Thandi said she knew how difficult it was to lack pads or attend school on an empty stomach. “It was so rewarding to see the happy faces when we handed out the pads. “I’m very happy to make a difference in the community.” Impendulo principal Doreen Mampuru said they were grateful for the donation. “This means so much to our pupils,” she said.
