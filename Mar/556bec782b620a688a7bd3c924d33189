The Kardashian / Jenner family have been hit with fresh cheating allegations – this time Kylie is reportedly accusing her baby daddy Travis Scott. According to TMZ, Travis cancelled a performance scheduled in Buffalo on Thursday night due to illness. But sources claim it’s more than that. The allegations are reported to have been made by Kylie after Travis arrived home to surprise the 21-year-old and their 1-year-old daughter, Stormi on Wednesday night. Kylie claims to have found evidence that proves the rapper cheated on her. Shortly before news of the alleged affair broke, Travis tweeted that he would not be able to make his show. SEE THE TWEET HERE:  Travis has strongly denied the rumours with the Sicko Mode rapper’s rep telling E! News: “The reason he stayed home from his show tonight was very much because of illness.” The allegations come days after Khloé ended her relationship with Tristan Thompson after he was allegedly seen hooking up with Kylie’s best friend, Jordyn Woods. Jordyn is scheduled to share her side of the story in a tell-all interview on Jada Pinkett Smith’s Facebook show, Red Table Talk, on Friday. https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/kylie-jenner-accuses-travis-scott-of-cheating-20190301
