 The Springbok Sevens’ run at the Las Vegas Sevens came
to an unceremonious end, going down 29-10to the hosts, the USA, in
the early hours of Sunday morning (SA time). The Blitzboks were stunned as the Americans had their number with an
impressive performance by Danny Barrett and conceded three first half tries and
were down 29-0 halfway through the second half before two late tries gave some
respectability to the scoreline. But it was a very disappointing performance from the two time World Series
defending champs as their season continues to struggle after the departure of
several players. Barrett, Stephen Tomasin and Martin Iosefo scored in the first half and
then Carlin Isles and Matai Leuta who scored without reply as the USA kept up
their dream run in this year’s series. JC Pretorius and Stedman Gans scored late tries for the Blitzboks
to get them into double figures but it was never close to being enough. The Blitzboks will lose valuable points as they can only challenge
for fifth place in Vegas, and will be disappointed with their own performance. They will face their nemesis Fiji, who lost to New Zealand in
their next match while New Zealand will face the USA in the first Cup
semi-final and Samoa will face Argentina in the other semi-final. The Blitzboks will face Fiji at 22:28 on Sunday. Should they win that match, they will face the winner of the
Australia v England clash in the playoff for 5th/6th spot at 01:35 on Monday. RESULTS: USA World Rugby Sevens Series on Saturday: Pool A Canada
