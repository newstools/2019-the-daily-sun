DOROTHY Masuka’s legacy will live forever. These were the words of speakers who attended the singer’s funeral yesterday. Dozens of friends, relatives, musicians and public figures such as former president Thabo Mbeki gathered at the University of Joburg’s Soweto campus to bid farewell to the jazz star. Singer Thandiswa Mazwai said: “Mama Dorothy sang songs which took me back home.” National Arts Council of Zimbabwe director Nicholas Moyo said he had come not to mourn, but to celebrate. “Her work will continue to speak to us even though she has left.” Gauteng Arts and Culture MEC Faith Mazibuko lashed previous speakers such as former SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng, who accused the government of not assisting artists while they were still alive. “The government makes sure heroes are recognised and their legacy lives forever. “When they pass on, they are buried in a dignified manner. “Those who don’t know what to say must just keep quiet,” she said. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said Dorothy was no longer around but her legacy would live forever. “We pay our last respects and shed a tear for an iconic artist who told stories through music. A great artist has left our midst, but we won’t forget her,” he said.
