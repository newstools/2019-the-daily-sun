Church leaders gathered outside pastor Alph Lukau's church on ThursdayÂ  to condemn his actions. This is after a video of him claiming to raise a dead man went viral on social media. Council of African Independent Churches's Bishop Thami Ngcana said foreign pastors must be registered to operate in Mzani. Asked if he was jealous because they make more money than them he said he was not.
