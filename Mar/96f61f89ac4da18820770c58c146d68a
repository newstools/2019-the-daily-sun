TWO doctors from Tokyo in Japan have been arrested on
suspicion of lacing the drinks of two women with drugs before raping them. According to Asahi, the doctors, both in their 20s, are
accused of taking two women out to a Japanese-style pub in the early evening of
18 January. The four had all gone on a date together some months
before. The women say they were encouraged to drink freely, and
believe that the drinks were spiked because of the extreme effect the drinks had
on them. “They forced me to drink. I lost consciousness at the
karaoke parlor and woke up at the man’s apartment,” said one of the women. CCTV footage show them unable to walk without help, being
taken to one of the suspect’s apartment. Following the cop investigation after the women reported
it, one of the suspects claims he had consensual sex with one of the women. The
other doctor admitted he had sexually assaulted the woman while she was drunk. Cops found traces of a drug in both women’s blood that is
not available over the counter. Investigations are continuing.
