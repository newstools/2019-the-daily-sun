THE Umzimvubu Municipality on Tuesday confirmed that R2 million had gone missing. Officials were responding to a petition delivered by local contractors at a meeting in KwaBhaca Town Hall. In the petition, the Umzimvubu Business Forum alleges that contracts were given to big companies from outside and tenders awarded to friends and family of officials. Acting mayor Florida Ngonyolo said: “In October our chief financial officer got a call from a person claiming to be the director of a company that was due to be paid. “The person was in a hurry to change bank accounts and told our officials he couldn’t meet in person. He emailed the required documents and money was paid. “Less than a month later, the person called again claiming to be the director of a company that had not been paid. “The matter was brought to our attention and the account was frozen. The money will be recovered.” Portfolio head of budget Happy Ngqasa said R800 000 of the money had already been spent when they managed to track it down. Forum member Ayanda Mageusha was disappointed by the municipality’s response.
