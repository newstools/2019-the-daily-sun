KAIZER Chiefs coach, Ernst Middendorp, says goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi needs to show the mental toughness in order to bounce back to his game when Amakhosi host Highlands Park in an Absa Premiership encounter at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Last weekend Akpeyi added to Chiefs’ woes when he made a blunder, allowing Walter Musona’s shot from distance to creep underneath his hands to concede a soft goal, which saw Amakhosi draw 1-1 with Polokwane City at Peter Mokaba Stadium. This was one of many Chiefs’ mistakes from the goalkeeping department since their number one stopper Itumeleng Khune sustained a shoulder injury. But to regain your confidence as a goalkeeper after a big blunder is always a big challenge. The Nigerian stopper was signed from Chippa United in January to add stability to the team since Virgil Vries, who stood in for Khune, was conceding through silly mistakes. However, it seems the crisis is getting worse for Chiefs. Middendorp is now hoping for a positive response tomorrow when they tackle the Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba. “I only hope that Akpeyi has the right mentality to bounce back and not get affected by that setback,” Middendorp advised. “As a professional player you expect that there’s a possibility to make a mistake, it is normal, nothing unusual. “That was my first approach with Vries too‚ where I said‚ ‘absolutely‚ that can happen’. “Nothing wrong with it. And then in the next games‚ one or two were good‚ and then we have seen that against Cape Town City he had another (error). “And that should not happen. We must accept it at the moment, he will start (against Highlands) and I’m hopeful he’s mentally strong.” Chiefs have not won a league match in their last three outings. After 21 league matches they have accumulated 29 points, which is three points above their visitors Highlands and 10 adrift of log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns.
