POLOKWANE City claimed the bragging rights and the all-important three points in the Limpopo Derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. A brace by Mohammed Anas and a goal by Salulani Phiri saw City thump Baroka FC 3-1 in the Absa Premiership to solidify their spot in the top eight. Rise and Shine came into the clash in confident mood following solid draws against log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns and Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs. Jozef Vukusic’s charges, however, were eying all three points this time around against their neighbours. The Slovakian tactician made one change to the team that ran out against Amakhosi last time out with Anas preferred upfront to Charlton Mashumba. And that change proved to be a stroke of genius as the Ghanaian put in a man of the match performance. Baroka on the other hand, were hoping to move further clear of the relegation zone with the teams below them starting to gain ground. Bakgaga fancied their chances against Rise and Shine, especially after their morale boosting 2-1 win over SuperSport United in their last game. But Wedson Nyirenda’s men could not repeat that result as they went behind as early as the 18th minute through Anas. Zambian midfielder Phiri doubled City’s lead in the second half with an easy tap in. Bakgaga, who had defender Bonginkosi Makume sent off earlier, did manage to pull a goal back via Collins Makgaka in the 63rd minute. Pushing for an equaliser with ten men, Baroka were caught on the counter late in the game as Anas sealed his brace with a well taken goal. It does not get any easier for Bakgaga as they next travel to Tembisa to face Highlands Park in what will be another tough encounter on Saturday.
