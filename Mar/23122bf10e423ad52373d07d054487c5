MZANSI celebs are fed up with Mampintsha. Since a video of him hitting Babes Wodumo surfaced on Monday morning, local celebs took to social media to tell it like it is. Sizwe Dhlomo tweeted: “First off, fuck Mampintsha! I said it then & I’ll say it now. He needs to be arrested & I hope it happens today. For those that keep asking though, this doesn’t change a damn thing about how Masechaba handled that situation. That sh!t was wrong too.”   Reason tweeted “Actually... Fuck Mampintsha!”  Even the ever so nice Maps Maponyane was not having it, he tweeted “F*ck Mampintsha! Surely there's NO defending him and his abusive ways. If he is not made an example of, the system will be blatantly failing victims of abuse. I just hope Babes uses the same courage she had to take the video, to press charges against him this time around.”  Rapper Rouge tweeted “Fuck Mampintsha.... Complete trash.”
