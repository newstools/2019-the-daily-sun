ESKOM didn’t follow proper processes when it accepted a R28 billion loan from a Chinese company. Eskom’s corporate specialist for funding, Sincedile Shweni, said at the Zondo Commission yesterday that Huarong’s proposal for the loan agreement was not sent to Eskom’s asset and liability committee for approval. In 2016 Eskom received a loan from Huarong for a financing solution to build or refurbish its power stations. Shweni said instead of following approved procedure, former Eskom chief financial officer Anoj Singh told treasurer Andre Pillay they needed to submit the proposal to a higher committee. He said he believed if the Huarong proposal had gone through the committee, it would not have succeeded. Shweni said shortly after the signing of the term sheets, a trip to China was planned. Huarong’s parent company, Ideva Holdings, had no trading record and their financial statements had a zero balance. Shweni said he did not raise his concerns about Ideva with the South African Reserve Bank and admitted that if he had, the bank would probably have come to a different conclusion about the transaction. Shweni said there was a lot of pressure from Eskom strategic projects general manager, Poobie Govender, and Huarong’s Rajeev Thomas.
