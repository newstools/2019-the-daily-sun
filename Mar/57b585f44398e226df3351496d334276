Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa has encouraged Gqom star Babes Wodumo to lay charges against Mampintsha. Mthethwa  said: “We're absolutely horrified by the actions of Musician Mampintsha caught on video, where he brutally abuses the Internationally celebrated Artist.” The minster condemned the actions of Mampintsha and he said gender-based violence should never be tolerated.  “It is informed by a twisted logic of patriarchal power relations in society. We call on all South Africans to isolate the perpetrators and to fight and defeat gender-based violence with the same zeal as when we fought racism,” He said.
