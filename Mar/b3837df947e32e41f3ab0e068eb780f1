MOLETJIE Basic Education circuit manager Joe Mahomole said pastors should be involved at schools to pray for pupils. Speaking on Friday at a local community hall, he told Daily Sun Satanism has taken over schools, putting teachers and pupils’ lives in danger. Mahomole told Daily Sun they have had enough of gangster pupils killing teachers and fellow pupils. “It is shocking that many of our pupils and teachers have been killed and it is affecting our work.” Mahomole said dedicated teachers who work hard for their communities are at risk. “We will never win this battle as long as parents continue being blind to the situation. What we see at our schools is disgraceful and needs attention,” he said. “Education is being robbed by gangsters and crime, and affecting performance.” Mahomole said it was a pity that schools were becoming shebeens and battlefields. “Our pupils have chosen drugs and a gang lifestyle over education.” He said because many parents had given up on their children, it made it difficult for teachers to make pupils behave. “We urge all innocent pupils to follow in the footsteps of those who have made it in life so they can also be successful in life.”
