THEY have tried everything to fight crime. And now the cops have turned to God! “We believe God, the master of everything, will hear us so we can fight the scourge of crime,” said Brigadier Themba Denge of Ekurhuleni police. Yesterday cops invited churches and community members to pray with them so they could catch the most wanted criminals. The prayer was held at Vosloorus Stadium in Ekurhuleni. Denge said there had been a spike in housebreakings, serious and violent crime, and assaults in the area since last October. “We tried everything in our power to fight, but we’re not winning the battle,” Denge told the People’s Paper. “We sat down at the office of public safety in Ekurhuleni and decided that turning to God would help us win the battle. We pray for the safety of police and the public.” He said they will call anti-crime and prayer meetings in hot spots in Vosloorus and neighbouring areas. Special prayers will be held every month.
