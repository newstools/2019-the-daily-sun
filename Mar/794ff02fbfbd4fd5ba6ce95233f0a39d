EVERY Sunday, residents saw the man leave the house with his Bible, heading for church. They never suspected the pastor of doing anything wrong. But residents of Braamfischerville in Soweto were shocked over the weekend when police cars surrounded the pastor’s home. And the cops did not find Bibles in his house – they found drugs! A resident told Daily Sun: “He looked too good and trustworthy for the things that were found in his yard.” Police told the People’s Paper that four suspects will appear in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court today on charges of manufacturing and dealing in drugs. They said the four suspects, aged between 35 and 58, were bust on Friday in an operation involving the Hawks’ South African narcotics bureau, crime intelligence counter narcotics, and the Gauteng K9 unit. “The multi-disciplinary team searched the house and found a lab suspected of being used to produce mandrax,” Hawks spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said. “The drug lab was allegedly in operation when the team swooped in, seizing a large amount of mandrax buttons and other chemicals and equipment. “The entire cargo is suspected to run into millions. The correct figures will be released at a later stage.” Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya said secret drug labs posed a danger to the public. He urged anyone with info about the manufacture of illicit drugs to report it to the authorities.
