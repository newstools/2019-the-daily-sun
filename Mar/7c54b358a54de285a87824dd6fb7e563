HER love for the ramp has pushed Refilwe Malatji to reach her full potential since joining the modelling world in 2013. The 14-year-old from Sterpark in Polokwane, Limpopo, started modelling when she was nine and has enjoyed every moment. “ It’s something I love and am passionate about. I’ll do everything I can to succeed.” The grade 9 pupil from Pepps College near Dalmada told Daily Sun: “I won Miss Galaxy International 2016 and was crowned Miss Toddler and Tween Pre-teen 2016 queen, Queen of the North 2016, Miss Polokwane Observer Teen 2017, Miss Hope Teen 2018, and have won many other titles”. Refilwe also won the Miss Junior Face of Beauty 2018. “I competed against eight contestants, who were awesome. We were judged and given points on ramp style, technique, eye contact, smile, stage personality and self-confidence,” she said. The Miss Junior Face of Beauty 2018 title will give Refilwe a chance to fulfill her dream. She will go to Dubai in September for a week to compete for the Miss Junior Model International title. “I want to prove to other countries that South Africa has lots of talent.” She still needs R50 000 for travel, accommodation, food and costumes. “I need the money because this competition is very important to me,” she pleaded.
