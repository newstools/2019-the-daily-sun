NEW Tshwane mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has condemned the vandalism of municipal property. During a visit to Bronkhorstspruit earlier this week, the mayor highlighted the importance of involving the community in protecting property. Speaking about Zithobeni Stadium, he said: “The stadium is an eyesore and has suffered serious vandalism at the hands of some residents.” He said the stadium, which was completed in 2017, needed a further R10 million to be fixed. “That amount could have been used to provide better services to the masses but now it will have to go towards fixing what was intentionally broken.” Mokgalapa said the city would make funding available in the next budget to put the facility to good use. He said they would not give up on the stadium as it could provide young people with activities to keep them off the streets. “My task is to promote a culture of ownership among residents and to encourage them to guard our scarce resources,” he said. “All residents should stand against crime and report bad elements in their community so law enforcement can intervene and defend against the further destruction of assets meant to serve the whole community.” During his visit, the mayor also visited Zithobeni Clinic to check that staff were behaving professionally. He said his party’s manifesto was focused on promoting residents’ health. Mokgalapa said his administration recognised the difficulties faced by many residents in accessing healthcare and dealing with substance abuse. “We are committed to addressing these challenges. Our emphasis for this term of office is to put people first,” he said.
