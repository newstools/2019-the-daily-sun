Banyana Banyana were thumped 4-1 by Korea DPR in the second match of the 2019 Cyprus Women’s Cup on Friday in Cyprus. The Koreans who are ranked number 11 in the world easily defeated Banyana scoring four goals in the first half of the match. Korea grabbed an early lead when Kim Yun-Mi pounced on poor defending from the South Africans in the seventh minute.Banyana attempted a come back, but a move involving Linda Motlhalo and Thembi Kgatlana failed to produce a goal moments later. The Asian nation doubled their advantage through Ri Hyang-Sim from lackluster defending once again after 13 minutes. Yun-Mi made it three shortly after the halfway stage in the first half following an assist from Ri PomHyang.Ten minutes to halftime, Wi Jong-Sim rubbed further salt in Banyana’s wounds with a good finish from close range.Desiree Ellis made a double switch at the start of the second half when Kholosa Biyana and Jermaine Seoposenwe came in for Nompumelelo Nyandeni and Karabo Dhlamini.Lebohang Ramalepe reduced the deficit early in the second period, but there will be much for coach Des Ellis to ponder as her near full-strength side crumbled in a performance that fell well short of their recent high standards. Ellis made six changes from the side that drew 2-2 with Finland in their opener on Wednesday, restoring Thembi Kgatlana and Linda Motlhalo to the starting line-up, along with Kaylin Swart, Bambanani Mbane, Mamello Makhabane and Nompumelelo Nyandeni.
