The player was among a list of 13 players that were released by Chilli Boys early this year. The 28-year-old Shongwe is well travelled, having played for Mamelodi Sundowns and Wits â€“ where he won the Absa Premiership title in 2017. He also played for Golden Arrows at the beginning of the season before joining Chippa United.
