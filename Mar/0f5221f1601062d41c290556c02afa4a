THIS cop will think twice before asking for a cooldrink again to make a case disappear. On Tuesday, he received the beating of his life at a shopping centre in Durban! A 56-second video of the incident has gone viral on social media, showing the cop in full uniform being punched by two men as a rowdy crowd watches. As the two men roughly pull the cop out of the shopping centre, someone can be heard saying “beat him” in Zulu, while another voice says, “Give him to us. We’ll bring him back”. A man who looks like a security guard is seen talking to the cop and the two men in what seems to be a negotiation. A woman’s voice is heard saying “he must be beaten”, while the men pull him out of the shopping centre. The cop apparently bust a woman and called her family to get a bribe. “He apparently organised to meet the family at the shopping centre and was beaten for failing to answer the questions the woman’s relatives asked him.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a cop was attacked at business premises. “A case of assault was opened at Durban Central Police Station.”
