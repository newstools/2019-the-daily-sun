THE family of a farm worker who died on Sunday while waiting for an ambulance to take her to hospital said the woman would still be alive if there were hospitals closer to their area. They said this shock not only left them in pain, but they had to raise money to bury their daughter too. Dineo Nkuna (31), who used to work at the forest plantation on Waterhoutboom farm near Graskop in Mpumalanga, died while being transported in a truck on Sunday. Her mum, Sarah Nkuna (54), said if the hospital was closer, her daughter could have survived. She said they had no option but to use a truck as they could see an ambulance was not coming after three hours. “I’m in pain after losing my daughter who was working hard trying to help her family. “Now I don’t even know where to start so I can bury her with dignity.” Councillor Sandile Shongwe said he wasn’t aware of the problem, but he promised to contact the family to see if he could assist with funeral arrangements. “We have a problem because ambulances take too long to respond during an emergency but I believe it’s a challenge affecting the whole province,” he said. Provincial health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “Expansion in terms of operating ambulances requires additional staff to man those vehicles. The the department will be expanding the capacity as time goes on.”
