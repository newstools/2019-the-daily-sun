WHEN detective Shadrack Mthalane is not maintaining law and order, he’s uplifting the community’s spirit with music. The 41-year-old from Khalanyoni in Harrismith, Free State, is the founder of Amadodana Ase African Presbyterian Bafolisi Church music group. The all-male group has 13 members aged between 27 and 85. Shadrack said he grew up in the church and music has always been his passion. “Our oldest member is Bishop Edward Maduna. He is 85,” said Shadrack. They have already released five albums. The most popular are Rea u boka Morena, Ndikhangele Ngobubele and Modimo o re ratile. Shadrack said they won an award at the Mpumalanga Gospel Music Awards in the category of best Amadodana. “This year we are planning to release two albums – Ntate ya Mosa and Kristu Mkhululi we thu.”
