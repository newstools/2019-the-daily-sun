Pastor Paseka 'Mboro' Motsoeneng says Alph Lukau should stop lying in the name God. Mboro was spitting fire outside Lekau's church on Thursday. He went there to ask Lukau to repent but Lukau lock Mboro and other pastors outside. He says Lukau performed the 'dead man' miracle to compete with Bushiri, whom people died at his church. "He was trying to say that he is better than Bushiri. He wanted people to leave Bushiri and go to his church. "If God didn't give you the power to perform miracles, just preach and leave those with the gift to do so," said Mboro.
