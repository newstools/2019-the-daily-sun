SOUTH African motorist can expect a large petrol price
increase this month. The Automobile Association says rising international
petroleum prices are the reason Mzansi is facing higher fuel prices in March. Central Energy Fund unaudited month-end fuel price data states
that the price of petrol is forecast to increase by around 73 cents a litre,
diesel by 92 cents and illuminating paraffin by 74 cents. The AA says the Rand/US dollar exchange rate worked slightly
in South Africa's favour during February. This reportedly resulted in a giving a savings of up to nine
cents a litre. “These price hikes come as toll fees across the country
increase, while additional increases to the General Fuel and Road Accident Fund
levies will apply in April.” “An additional tax to the fuel price the carbon tax will
come into force in June when an additional nine cents will be added to the
price of petrol and an additional ten cents will be added to the price of
diesel,” the AA said.
