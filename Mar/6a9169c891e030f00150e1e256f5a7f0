As smart technology takes a greater role in shaping lives it’s become a common sight to see computerisation and digitalisation in the workplace. A 2017 study by the McKinsey Global Institute hypothesized that, by 2030, up to 800 million jobs all around the world could be handled by robots instead of people. That’s one-fifth of the entire planet’s workforce. Leading fast food restaurants, notably McDonald’s, have already replaced some human cashiers with sleek machines, as diners increasingly choose to order their food through a kiosk or app, rather than talking to another person. Other jobs often listed as ‘at risk’ include telemarketers, which anyone who’s ever been placed ‘on hold’ can probably relate to.     So, jobs like therapists, nurses and any kind of caregivers aren’t likely to disappear any time soon, as they require compassion, consideration, instinct and relationship skills. Another distinctly human strength is strategic and critical thinking. While advanced robots have already shown themselves to be talented at trivia, or to be able to file sample taxes and crunch sometimes quite complex numbers, their abilities largely amount to data processing. While the less personable telemarketers will be – and often already have been – replaced, most other sales roles look set to stay as they are. Particularly those focused on selling unique, expensive or luxury items, and including roles as either a manager or agent of another person (perhaps an athlete or musician).   So, if you’re a mathematician, engineer or computer programmer, you could soon be styling yourself as an artist as well.
