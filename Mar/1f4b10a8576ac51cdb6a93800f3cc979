THEY planned to have a happy outing, but their plans ended in tragedy. Four boys from Ockley Trust, outside Mkhuhlu near Bushbuckridge, went swimming on Wednesday after school. According to the dead pupil’s friends, Alex Chauke (19) was in the water when an unknown man approached them. The man dragged Alex to the river’s deep end and left him there. They found Alex floating in the water. After they called for help, the villagers alerted the police. Shocked villagers told Daily Sun they rushed to the teenager’s rescue, but it took hours to pull the body out of the river. “Something could be wrong with this river because two people recently died at the same spot where this boy drowned,” said a resident. Calcutta police spokeswoman Sergeant Zanele Sibuyi said Alex was declared dead at the scene by paramedics. “We’ve opened an inquest docket for further investigation,” said Sibuyi. “We appeal to members of the community to stay away from rivers, especially during the rainy season.”
