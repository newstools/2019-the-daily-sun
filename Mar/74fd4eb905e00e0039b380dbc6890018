VIDEOS and images of bullying keep going viral, but parents wonder what happens to bullies after they’re exposed. Bullying allegedly led a 13-year-old pupil at Doornpoort Primary School in Tshwane to committ suicide last Monday. The grade 6 pupil took her life after a grade 7 pupil allegedly threatened to distribute a video of her naked. SafeSchool CEO Megan Harrington-Johnson said kids under the age of 10 can’t be prosecuted. According to the Child Justice Act, children older than 10 but younger than 14 are presumed to be incapable of forming criminal intention. But if it is found beyond reasonable doubt that the child had the necessary criminal capacity, he or she could be held criminally liable for an offence. “Bullying happens daily,” Harrington-Johnson told the People’s Paper. “It can happen remotely by smartphone and often on platforms where children hide their identity.” She said although bullying has not been classified as a crime, there are many behaviours that could be classified as illegal in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act. These include crimen injuria, assault, extortion and attempted murder. Harrington-Johnson said prison sentences are meant to rehabilitate rather than punish children. She said the Protection from Harassment Act can also give relief to victims of bullying by giving them the option to file protection orders.
