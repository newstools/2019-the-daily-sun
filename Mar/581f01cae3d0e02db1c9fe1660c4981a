SHE was a diva, so let’s celebrate her! These were some of the words from people who attended jazz legend Dorothy Masuka’s memorial service. The service was held at Bethesda Methodist Mission in Houghton, Joburg, yesterday. Masuka died on Saturday, aged 83. According to her family, she spent her last moments at home, surrounded by those close to her. Masuka suffered from complications related to hypertension after she had a mild stroke last year. Her daughter Biantar said it was an honour to celebrate her mum. “To some of you she was a musician, but to us she was a mum, aunt and grandmother. “We remember her as a strong woman.” Laconqeur, Masuka’s great-grandchild, said the singer was larger than life. “She came from an era where it was impossible to make it, but she kept going until she did,” she said. She said Masuka inspired her to be strong. “Dorothy taught me to come out of my comfort zone,” she said. Some of Masuka’s grandchildren turned the sad memorial service into a joyous occasion when they went to the pulpit. Richman and Stanley said they would keep their gogo’s legacy alive. “The only thing gogo always remembered about me was that I always made breakfast for her,” said Stanley. Another memorial will be held at the Joburg Theatre today. Masuka will be buried on Sunday.
