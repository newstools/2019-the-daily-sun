COPS on Tuesday hosted a tournament to choose this year’s junior national police commissioner. Brigadier Vish Naidoo said 63 pupils took part in the competition in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. Junior commissioners from various high schools across the country gathered to debate social ills and to come up with solutions. Naidoo said one of the aims of the project was to nurture and mentor young people and to help build their leadership skills. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole said there had been a growing trend for pupils to become involved in crime. He said the project was focused on combating crime at schools. “The secondary focus of the project intends to complement the police service’s safer schools programme,” he said. The basic education department’s schools safety director, Paseka Njobe, said working with cops made it easier to deal with problems. “We do not have intelligence and investigative capacity, so it is critical our relationship with the police is understood in this context.” Naidoo said a junior commissioner and four deputies would soon be announced and inaugurated. “They will be subjected to an intensive induction programme after an appointment that will provide them with an in-depth knowledge and information about the police.”
