A taxi driver has been sentenced to 17 years behind bars. This is after he kidnapped and robbed a female passenger. Police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the 35-year-old named Zama Zulu from Durban, KZN, was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for kidnapping and five years for theft in the Durban Regional Court on Friday, the 1st of March 2019. Thembeka said the sentences would run consecutively. “It is alleged on February 20 2018‚ at 10.30pm‚ a 21-year-old woman took a taxi from South Beach to Smith Street and when she asked the driver to jump off at Smith Street‚ the taxi did not stop. Instead the driver locked the door and was assisted by the other man who was in the taxi,” said Thembeka. Thembeka said the accused’s accomplice threatened the victim and took her bag with her belongings. Thembeka said the woman suffered injuries after jumping out of the moving taxi. “She was taken to hospital for treatment. She opened charges of kidnapping and theft. Four days after the incident police arrested Zulu in the Point area,” she said. Thembeka said the accused he made several court appearances and his bail was denied until his sentence. “His accomplice is still at large and being sought by police‚” said Thembeka.
