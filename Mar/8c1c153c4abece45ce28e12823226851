EFF Commander In Chief Julius Malema celebrated his birthday at the Entokozweni Creche in Orange Farm. Juju who is 38 years old, helped renovate the crèche after learning of its poor state. Malema was accompanied by his wife, and EFF leadership including EFF National Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and National Chairperson Dali Mpofu. Mme Sweetness Marubela (56) the Principal at the crèche was overjoyed to have the EFF leader in her grounds. “It is amazing to have people who still care about the needs of the people on the grounds. We started the crèche in 1990. The crèche cater for 40 kids between 1-6 years old. We have been applying for the title deed for the land it stands since we started. All we’ve had were promises, but now with the EFF on the case we hope to have issues solved like they helped renovate the crèche,” Marubela said. The crèche cater for 40 kids between 1-6 years old. Juju said when they heard about the state of the crèche they knew that they had to do something. He said that they could not allow kids to be attending a crèche that leaked and did not have proper toilets. “We heard the cries of mama Marubela and we knew that we had to do something. Young kids are very important to the EFF and ECD’s, in particular, are of importance. We want to make it clear that even though we helped renovate this crèche it still belongs to the people. We don’t expect anything from the staff or the parents of the children for this crèche. It the community’s and not the EFF’s,” Malema said. Malema said that the EFF wants township ECDs to be on the same level as the ones in the suburbs. To do that he said that they need to be provided with all the help the government can provide. He said that owners of ECDs should get title deeds they need to get title deeds to the land in which they operate. He said the government should train staff in township ECDs so they can provide the education the kids need.
