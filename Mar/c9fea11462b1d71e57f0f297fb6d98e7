BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis is hoping to see improvement from her side as they continue their preparations for the Fifa Women’s World Cup. Banyana came from behind twice to force a 2-2 draw in their opening Cyprus Women’s Cup Group A match against Finland on Wednesday. Ellis is using the invitational women’s football tournament to fine tune her outfit ahead of their maiden appearance at the World Cup, set to take place in France in June. The former Banyana captain was happy with the character shown by her side, but insists they need to work on a few weak points that were exposed against the Pearl Owls. “We didn’t get the result we wanted but I felt the character we showed helped us a lot,” Ellis said. “At times we could have done a few things better, but we are open for improvement in the next game. I feel we’re on the right track but against such quality opponents, we have to do much better.” Banyana’s next game is against Korea DPR at AEK Arena, Larnaca o Friday (6pm SA time). Korea DPR are the highest ranked team in the tournament (11), and will most likely pose a serious threat than Finland. However, Ellis believes they have enough quality to hurt the Asians, who saw off Czech Republic 4-2 in their opening match. “The games are now coming thick and fast,” said Ellis. “Now we have to mentally switch on and be mentally ready. We have to show character again because we’re playing a much higher ranked team. “But we’ve played them before and I don’t think they would have changed much. We just need to get our game plan right and execute on the field.” Ellis has stressed the importance of giving her entire squad a run in the tournament as she would like to see what each player has to offer against top-class opposition. She is hopeful that the match situation in the rest of the games will allow her to make more substitutions. “We will probably make a couple of changes because we want to play more players,” Ellis added.
