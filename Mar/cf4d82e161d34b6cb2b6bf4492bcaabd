RESIDENTS of the village said they are exhausted from battling floods for nearly a year. The people of Ramotse Village in Hammanskraal, Tshwane said on Monday, they had to sleep on their feet during heavy rainfall because the water is not taken away by the storm drains. Selina Manala said the rising water has damaged all her furniture. Whenever she sees storm clouds gathering, she knows she’s in for another struggle. She said Councillor Betty Sebothoma has been told about the problem a number of times but their cries fall on deaf ears. “She takes some pictures with her fancy phone and then leaves. We don’t hear from her until we ask again what’s happening.” Selina said local kids had to miss school when the water soaked their uniforms. Johanna Mlambo, another resident, said she was not going to replace her damaged furniture because the next rain would flood her house again. She said that many residents were tired of the situation and if their councillor didn’t help them, they would not vote for them in the next election. “We can’t keep voting for the same politicians but we don’t get any help from them. We are suffering and none of them does anything about it,” Johanna said. Councillor Sebothoma told the SunTeam that she reported the matter to the municipality but she had no control over how or when they operate. “I showed the pictures I took to the people at the municipality but I can’t tell them how to allocate funds or when to do it. “I have to wait for them to get back to me.”
