PREMIER Willies Mchunu (70) is not retiring because of ill health. While he said it was time to join people his own age, he denied he was retiring because of his health. Mchunu, the current KZN premier, made the announcement on Wednesday evening at a media briefing he called after his discharged from Grey’s Hospital. The announcement came after he fainted while delivering his state of the province address on Wednesday at the Pietermaritzburg Show grounds. He said he suddenly blacked out and didn’t know what was happening. He said his illness started in 2004 where a doctor found he had a gallstone. “I have decided to leave active politics because it causes stress to people of my age, but I will continue working in lower structures of the ANC,” he said. He attended the debate of his speech in the legislature and was expected to officially inform the legislature of his retirement. His spokesman Thami Ngidi said he doubted Mchunu would wait until the election, because of the incident on Wednesday. “The legislature will have to call a special sitting between now and 8 May where the premier will make his farewell speech if he didn’t do it yesterday,” said Ngidi. Mchunu, who turns 71 this year, became a member of legislature in 1994 and the speaker in 2004. In 2009 he was appointed Transport MEC. He became premier in 2016.
