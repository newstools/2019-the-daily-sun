 YESTERDAY, EFF leader Julius Malema celebrated his birthday with some little ones. Juju, who turned 38, helped to renovate Entokozweni Creche in Orange Farm, south of Joburg. He was accompanied by his wife Mantwa Matlala-Malema, the party’s national spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and national chairman Dali Mpofu. The creche’s principal, Sweetness Marubela (56) was overjoyed at the visit and thanked the leaders. “It is amazing to have people who still care about the needs of others. We have been applying for the title deed since we started. All we’ve had are promises but now with the EFF on the case, we hope the issue will be solved,” she said. Juju said they knew they had to do something when they heard about conditions at the centre. He said creche children should not have to endure a leaky roof and lack of proper toilets. “Young kids are very important to the party, as well as early childhood development centres. Even though we helped renovate this creche, it still belongs to the people. We don’t expect anything from the staff or parents. “All the renovations were done in a week. Imagine what we could achieve if we were in government,” he said.
