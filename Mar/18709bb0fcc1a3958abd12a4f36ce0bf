Police Minister Bheki Cele spoke tough against Prophet Alph Lukau today at Thorisho Themane (28) funeral in Polokwane, Limpopo. Cele said that they are aware that churches give them problems and that Government needs to step in. "Things we see are shocking, people are being resurrected and we are told it's a miracle. These pastors hire people to come and do nonsense here. We have pastors who carry R17 Million in private jets and when we ask where did they get the money, they fail to answer. Cele said. He added that most of these pastors who are performing miracles are coming from nowhere. "Why can't they grow their churches where they come from? They must also raise their mothers and fathers first where they come from . Even you people must stop following these churches." Minister said. He pleaded that people of South Africa must give the police space to do their work by Government in churches. He said, "There's a lot of work to be done in churches. Don't blame us when we start to arrest pastors. Our people are being made to eat grass, some were sprayed with doom, some even eat snakes."
