 Cultural experts have joined the public in condemning
Mampintsha. One cultural expert flat-out called Mampintsha a coward. This is after a video of him beating up superstar Babes
Wodumo was shown while Babes went live on Instagram. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya told Daily Sun that what Mampintsha did was seen culturally as
cowardice. “In culture a woman is not hit,” he said. “No matter how wrong a woman is, we believe that a man has
strength and under no circumstance can he use his strength against her.” Ngwenya strongly condemned Mampintsha. “He is no man, and he doesn’t deserve to live in society. “If he feels the need to beat a women up he must go live
elsewhere with men like him.” Ngwenya noted that women are weak and vulnerable and men are
aware of this. “That video shows that what Mampintsha did has become a norm
to him,” he said. “There is no point of justification traditionally and
culturally. “If a woman angers you, it is always best to leave the room. “Women by nature are provocative but as a man you need to
uphold your values that you will never raise their hand to a woman,” he also
said.
