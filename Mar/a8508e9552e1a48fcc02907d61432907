THANKS to SunPower, gogo’s dignity has been restored! Gogo and her family finally have a toilet. On 19 February, Daily Sun reported that gogo Suzan Kgosiemang (73) from Huhudi in Vryburg, North West, used buckets to relieve herself. It didn’t take long for the story to catch the attention of a private company, which immediately visited gogo and promised her a toilet. But it wasn’t the empty promises gogo Suzan had been getting for over 14 years. Amalooloo, a company that specialises in sanitation services, delivered a fully functional toilet on Tuesday. However, the toilet could not be flushed as the area is experiencing serious water cuts. The company’s project manager Wimpie Strydom said the company was all about helping the community. “Seeing that our government is stretched, we assist where we can. We’re here to restore the old lady’s dignity,” he said. Ward councillor Lotta Moholo said he was happy as the family had waited for a long time. Gogo Suzan said: “I’m very happy. I thank my neighbour Gaoretelwe Molebalwa for bringing this to Daily Sun’s attention. And I thank Amalooloo for keeping its promise to help people.”
