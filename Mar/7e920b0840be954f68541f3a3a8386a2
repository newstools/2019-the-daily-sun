AT LEAST three people on a pavement were injured when a taxi came flying at them out of nowhere. The crash happened at 5pm on Tuesday in Symphony Way, Thabo Mbeki squatter camp. Honjiswa Mjikilana (41), who was standing next to her stall, can’t believe she’s still alive. “I just saw a taxi coming out of nowhere and tried to run but it hit me in my legs.” Honjiswa is thankful to her ancestors because if it weren’t for their protection, she would’ve been dead. “That taxi was sent to kill us but with God’s grace and the ancestors’ protection, I am still here,” said the seller of chicken feet and intestines. “Who would take care of my kids if this taxi had killed me? “I will forever praise the Lord.” Nomzamo Makhabela (23), who was in the taxi, said: “I don’t know how we survived because death was in front of us. “God works in strange ways.” Zukhanye Gwibana (43) said the taxi destroyed the hawkers’ things. “It was sent to kill them. If I were them, I’d visit a sangoma to find out what’s really happening.” She said luckily, the owner of the salon where it happened was not there. “She was lucky because she would’ve been dead.” Questioned by police, the taxi driver later said he’d lost control of the vehicle.
