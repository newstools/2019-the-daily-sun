PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has accused President Cyril Ramaphosa and a number of other leaders of ignoring her remedial actions. At a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday, Mkhwebane said she asked Ramaphosa last year to act against Police Minister Bheki Cele. This was for failing to protect two whistleblowers in KZN, but nothing was done. She complained that among those who ignored her findings was the Tshwane Municipality, in relation to the irregular awarding of a smart meter tender. “Despite numerous follow-ups, letters and meetings from our side, they have not done anything. Our pleas have fallen on deaf ears,” she said. “I tried to find other means to get them to implement my remedial actions and now this is my last resort. But I will continue to fight.”
