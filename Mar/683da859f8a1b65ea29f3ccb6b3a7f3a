A 72-YEAR-OLD gogo who escaped death by seconds is grateful to her ancestors. Thoko Mkhize from KwaDabeka, north of Durban, got the shock of her life when a truck crashed into her house on Monday. The driver allegedly lost control, veered off the road, and crashed into her house. Ntokozo Nkomo (33), a passenger, died. Thoko escaped unharmed. She said she was sitting in her dining room when she heard a strange noise coming towards her house. Seconds after she went out to investigate, the truck crashed into the house and destroyed four rooms. “I believe I was saved by my ancestors because the nearest door that would have led me to the yard was the front door,” said Thoko. Her son Nathi Mkhize (47) said he didn’t believe his eyes when he saw the truck crashing into their home. “I was in my spaza shop, when I saw the truck driving into oncoming traffic,” he said. “That’s when I realised there was something wrong with the truck.” Nathi said minutes later the driver jumped out of the moving truck. “When Ntokozo jumped out of the truck, her head hit the ground and she died,” he said. Ntokozo’s uncle Dumsani (53) said the driver told him the truck’s brakes failed. “He said he told Ntokozo to jump out as he couldn’t control the truck. “But Ntokozo was scared and only jumped out when the truck was about to hit the house.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “A woman died at the scene. Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide,” said Mbele.
