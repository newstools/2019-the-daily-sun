THE battle between Endumeni Municipality and former mayor Siboniso Mbatha is heading for court. They have been fighting over R490 000 the municipality claims Mbatha owed for allegedly abusing a municipal petrol card. Speaker Lucky Khumalo told Daily Sun the municipality would file court papers this week asking for Mbatha’s assets to be attached. Khumalo said Mbatha was given seven days to pay, which expired last week. He said Mbatha abused the municipal card by making personal trips. “We want him to pay back taxpayers’ money but he is arrogant.” Khumalo said Mbatha was given R15 000 for petrol each month but he used to spend it in two weeks. He said it was clear Mbatha took personal trips as the municipality is small and only has seven wards. Mbatha previously told Daily Sun he would not pay the municipality, saying the person who should answer for the petrol card was the one who authorised his trips. He was fired as mayor last year, together with Speaker Bongiwe Mbatha-Makhathini, after he was bust and charged with plotting to kill Mbatha-Makhathini. The case is expected to go to trial in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court next month. Mbatha said voetsak to those who demand petrol card money from him, saying he would not pay it back. “They must go to hell. I wasn’t responsible for card authorisation. They must ask the municipal fleet manager.”
