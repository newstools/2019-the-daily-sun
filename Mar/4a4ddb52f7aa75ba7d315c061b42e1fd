MORE than 2,5 million Ugandans have cancelled their
internet subscriptions, thanks to punishing taxes imposed on social media use
by the government. And while some in government claim that the tax is meant
to raise money for the country, others say its real aim is to clamp down on
free speech. According to the Guardian, the daily levy of 200 Ugandan
shillings (about 75c) was introduced in July. More than 60 online platforms were identified as being so-called
“Over The Top” (OTT) sites, chosen because they offer voice and messaging
services. These are the ones that are taxed, and they include Facebook, Twitter
and Instagram. Three months on, millions have stopped using them. The Ugandan government also slapped a tax on money
transactions using mobile phones, the most common way locals do their banking. The value of mobile money transactions also fell by trillions
in three months. While finance minister David Bahati said the tax was to
raise money for public services, president Yoweri Museveni urged the
introduction of the tax as a way of shutting down “online gossip”. Lawyer Irene Ikomu told the Guardian: “The tax has not
generated the revenue the government anticipated.” Instead, technology and financial sectors have taken a
dive.
