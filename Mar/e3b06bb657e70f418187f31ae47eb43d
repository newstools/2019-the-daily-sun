SINAH Montsho spoiled her grandchildren when she received her social grant. But all this changed this month when she received a dreadful message from Sassa saying she shared her ID with someone else. Despite going to Home Affairs in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, her problems have not been solved. Now, the 62-year-old from Hebron, North West, is surviving on handouts. Gogo Sinah said she used her ID for many years with no problems. “I suspect someone fraudulently sold my ID number. I also suspect the person was after my social grant,” she said. “I’m not the one who committed a crime. Why didn’t they stop the thug’s ID instead of mine?” gogo asked. She said Home Affairs was not helping. “I was asked to bring an affidavit, which I did. I was then sent from town to Ga-Rankuwa, but still got no help.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola promised to look into the matter.
