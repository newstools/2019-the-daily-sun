IT’S a government school and kids are supposed get space for free. But fuming parents at Comet Primary School in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, said they were being sold spaces. They said they were forced to pay between R600 and R1 000 for space depending on the grade of the child. Yesterday fuming parents, who had gathered outside the school gates, wanted to beat up the school governing body chairman, Vincent Chauke. They said he was plotting with teachers to sell them spaces. Cops had to be called to intervene at the school. Most of the parents, who are from Angelo, Delmore and Jerusalem squatter camps, claimed they applied on time last year for their children to be admitted to the school. “Now we are turned away because we don’t have money. “Priority is given to those who have, while those who don’t are turned away,” said community leader Khutso Segage. They vowed no schooling would take place until their kids were admitted. “We noticed parents who have money are allowed in and those who don’t are turned away. This is totally wrong and we are not going to sit back and fold our arms,” said one of the parents. “South Africa is corrupt: everything has to be paid for, even free space in government schools.” Daily Sun spoke to principal Lawrence Maropyane who said the allegations were not true. “The only payment that is made is for Grade R, which is R450 a term. “We are a no-fee school and agreed with parents during a meeting that we had to find ways to raise funds. “We informed the district about this,” said Maropyane. Chauke said the reason some parents were paying was because they had outstanding amounts, which they did not pay last year. “Parents who are complaining are those who don’t attend meetings.”
