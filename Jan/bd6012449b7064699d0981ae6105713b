THE family of a killed businessman have appealed for more police patrols – they fear for their lives. Moses Moropane (45) was shot by an unknown gunman who broke into his home at Plaza View in Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. The incident happened on Saturday at about 1am. His wife Linkie Shubane (40) said: “We saw the gunman standing over our heads in the bedroom. “He demanded cash from our fish and chips and plumbing business. “He took a wallet which had six bank cards and cash inside.” But Moses wrestled with the gunman, who broke open the sitting room door with a hammer. “We could hear his friends outside telling him to open the door for them. “But the gunman and Moses wrestled for the hammer,” said Linkie. “The gunman overpowered Moses and shot him in the stomach, leaving him to die in a pool of blood.” Her daughter Pontsho (18) said: “I heard gunshots and woke up the neighbours and asked them to call the police. “When I returned my dad was lying dead on the cold floor.” Moses’ angry mum Resta (77) said: “Seven people were gunned down by criminals at their homes during robbery and rape this year. We need amaberete to patrol the streets as the killers might attack us at any time.” Captain Mpho Nonyane said police were investigating a case of murder. Anyone with information should call Colonel Albert Manzini on 082 4691 031.
