RESIDENTS from F section, KwaMashu, north of Durban, are willing to leave their parents’ homes to start a hard life of living in shacks that have no electricity and water. They are ready to make the sacrifice because they want to occupy vacant land, which has a vandalised building next to it. Last week, they invaded the land and divided it among each other to start building shacks while they wait for flats. They say if flats are built, crime will decrease as thugs have turned the place into their hiding den. A resident said their councillor told them the land would be used for a resource centre. “We do not want businesses here. “In our kasi, they end up closing down. “They end up being left vacant, which results in vandalism.” Another resident said they were not informed when the councillor made the decision about the resource centre. “We would have told him we need houses, not a resource centre. “We are not trying to cause trouble but simply appealing for houses to keep our area free from crime.” The resident said they will build shacks if flats are not built. Councillor Phiwayinkosi Ntshangase said he has set up a residents’ meeting to discuss the issue and that flats cannot be built as the land is reserved for the resource centre. Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “Police were told about people trying to erect shacks on vacant land. “They told them to disperse and they did. We will monitor the area,” Gwala said.
