ZIMBABWE and the entire music world have been thrust to mourning following the death of iconic musician, Oliver Mtukudzi. He died at the Avenues Clinic Harare on Thursday at the age of 66 following a battle with diabetes. The globally-recognised Mtukudzi, who is hailed one of the best musicians from the continent, was working on his 67th album at the time of his death. David Coltart, the former Zimbabwean Culture Minister, was among the first to pay tribute to the deceased. “Rest in peace Oliver Mtukudzi. If anyone ever made me proud to be Zimbabwean it was you. Thank you for making us happy for so long, especially during the darkest days,” Coltart said. South Africa musicians have also expressed sadness at his death. Fellow performer, Mazwai Thandiswa, also paid tribute. “RIP to a most humble and incredible musician whose music was universally loved,” she stated. Mazwai pointed out Mtukudzi’s death came exactly a year after fellow legend, Hugh Masekela’s death. Mtukudzi toured several countries and South Africa was like his second home. He was a Goodwill Ambassador for United Nations Children’s Fund and the coveted Cavaliere of the Order of Merit bestowed on him by the Italian government. Mtukudzi began performing in 1977. His most popular songs include Neria, Todii and Bvuma. His son Sam Mtukudzi, a successful musician in his own right, died in a car accident in 2010. Zimbabwe Exiles Forum (ZEF) executive director, Advocate Gabriel Shumbasaid: "Mtukudzi music would transcend across borders hence collaborating with the likes of Hugh Masekela. I watched him both at home (Zimbabwe) and in exile, and he will be greatly missed."
