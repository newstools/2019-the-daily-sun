THE new year could not have started worse for a 43-year-old mum from Mandela Village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga. Her seven-year-old daughter died in hospital after eating chicken wings suspected of having been laced with poison. The woman said her 18-year-old daughter’s ex-boyfriend called her to fetch braai wings and she came back with six wings and gave her mum three and her sister two. The mum saved hers, while the little girl ate three and the older daughter ate one. “We did not suspect anything,” she said. “We were shocked when the little one suddenly started foaming at the mouth and vomited.” The mum tried to pray for her but it did not help. “We gave her milk and water, but her mouth could no longer open,” she said. “I organised transport and rushed her to hospital. She was certified dead on arrival.” She said before the girl got ill, the ex-boyfriend kept calling to ask about the wings. “I think my older daughter was his target. The boyfriend wanted to check if she had died. She told him the sauce was not nice.” The mum said her older daughter later collapsed and a doctor said she had eaten poison called halephirimi. “At the mortuary they asked me to give them the wings to check the cause of my youngest daughter’s death.” The ex-boyfriend is nowhere to be found. Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said an inquest docket was opened and the case may be changed to murder.
