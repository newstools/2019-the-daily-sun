JUST a few days after the robbery at Menzi Primary School, some of the stolen items have been recovered. Four suspects have been bust for the robbery that took place at the school in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. The four will appear in the Tsakane Magistrates Court today. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said he was relieved when news broke that 22 tablets and three laptops believed to have been stolen from the school were recovered in the Joburg CBD on Friday. “We got the culprits! We are still hunting for more. Thank you so much to the community of Tsakane but most importantly, to the police.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “An intelligence operation by detectives from the Ekurhuleni East cluster and the trio task team led members to the Joburg CBD, where four suspects aged between 23 and 38 were arrested.”
