A GROUP of youths living with disabilities has appealed to the government and the public to treat them like normal human beings. Speaking at a social development camp held in Ermelo, Mpumalanga, they told the SunTeam about the challenges they faced. Lucky Skhosana (28) from Embalenhle has cerebral palsy. He said life was difficult for him because people didn’t think he was capable of doing certain things. Lucky, who is a qualified information technology developer, lives with his uncle and aunt. He said he insisted they build him a two-roomed house in the backyard so he could take care of himself. “Stop treating us like babies and pitying us, because I don’t feel sorry for myself. I can do everything by myself.” Bongiwe Mpila (20) from Kanyamazane is deaf and works as a monitor at a social development youth centre. She said she wanted the government to make sure everyone learned sign language because communication was very difficult for deaf people. Siphesihle Masemula (19) from Middleburg said living with albinism wasn’t as difficult as it used to be. She appreciates the support she gets from her community.
