PHILIPPI East cops recently seized alcohol in Marikana. Colonel Bongani Mtakati told Daily Sun alcohol causes crime. “We’ve been doing this operation for quite some time now because a lot of people sell alcohol illegally,” he said. He said most domestic violence cases were the result of people coming back from all-night taverns. In Marikana, the crime rate is high because of people operating without licences. “What we’re saying to them is that they must be regulated because they will know when to close and open.” He said the community needed to work with police, and that Lower Crossroads was most affected. “These places are giving us problems,” he said. “But we’re going to clean up, even those places we haven’t visited yet.” Thulani Pike, a liquor law advisor, said tavern owners that operate from squattor camps don’t qualify for licences. “They don’t have correct zoning or right of occupation, which is a title deed.” He said government laws don’t favour black small businesses.
