THE SOUTH African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has announced
that it will not continue with its retrenchment plan. In a statement the corporation said all its stakeholders
acknowledge the need to review the increase in costs, including the compensation
bill. “Hence the need to conduct a thorough skills audit and
related activities,” it said. In October last 2018, the SABC announced that it planned to
lay off almost 1 000 of its permanent workers, and at least 1 200 freelancers. According to the public broadcaster, they are doing this in
the interest of the SABC and its employees. “The SABC has decided not to renew the notice to invoke
section 189 of the LRA. This follows constructive and extensive engagements
with various stakeholders, including the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on
Communications, Organised Labour and our own employees,” It added. The outcome will reportedly provide the SABC with a
fit-for-purpose structure, which will have a clear and defined span of control. “This will ensure that the SABC meets its strategic
objective of operating optimally and competitively in a digitised environment.”
