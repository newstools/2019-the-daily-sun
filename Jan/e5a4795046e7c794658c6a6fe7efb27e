THOSE who have passed matric are encouraged to apply as entry level police trainees in the Western Cape. Captain Siyabulela Vukubi from Harare Police Station said the police in the Western Cape were currently in the process of recruiting entry level police constables. “Citizens between the ages of 18 and 30 years old with matric are invited to apply to be appointed as members of the SAPS,” he said. Applicants must be in possession of a driver’s licence, although 10% of the total allocation of trainees will be allowed without licences. Vukubi said applicants must be physically and mentally fit, will undergo a psychological and integrity assessment and be proficient in at least two official languages, one of which must be English. “Applicants must also be prepared to take the oath of office, not have any tattoo marks which will be visible when wearing SAPS summer uniform, and have no previous criminal convictions or pending criminal, civil and disciplinary cases,” he said. Anyone who wants to apply must be fit to possess a firearm and have a Body Mass Index less than 30. Applicants can visit their nearest police stations for further information and application forms. Closing date for applications is 18 January. .
