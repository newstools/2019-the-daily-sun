SHE regrets trying to stop her husband from cheating by using muthi. A 37-year-old from Lindelani in Ekurhuleni said she consulted a sangoma for muthi to put on her punani in February so she would be irresistible. But now she wants her punani to go back to the way it was. She told Daily Sun she and her husband had been married for six years but he started cheating after four years. She said they grew up together and she would hate to lose him so she went to a sangoma. “I did exactly as he told me but after a few months my punani became loose.” She said she has stopped enjoying sex and she thinks her husband has as well. “Sometimes his 4-5 stops working while we’re busy.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi discouraged women from using muthi they knew nothing about. “If a man does not want to be kept, he will leave.”
