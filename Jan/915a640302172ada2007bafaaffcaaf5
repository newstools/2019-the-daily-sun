PUSETSO’S life is on hold. This is because the 42-year-old does not have an ID. Pusetso Motokoa has been in South Africa since 1994. He’s originally from Lesotho and currently lives in Oakmere in Orange Farm, south of Joburg. Pusetso told Daily Sun he applied for an ID at Orlando Home Affairs, which transferred him to Rivonia Home Affairs. “I complied with everything they needed from me. I submitted every document and spent more than R5 000 going up and down trying to fix my life.” Pusetso has three children and has been married since 2012. He fears his oldest child will experience problems when she goes to university and is asked to submit her parents’ IDs. “Her life will stand still. I don’t want that. I don’t want my problems to affect my children’s futures. This needs to be fixed.” Pusetso said some people took advantage of him because he doesn’t have an ID. He said he gets piece jobs, but there are problems when he has to get paid. When he inquires at the CCMA, he needs to have an ID and a signed contract. “I’m now afraid of doing any work because people I worked for never paid me,” he said. He said he and his wife were unemployed and survived on their kids’ social grants. Gauteng Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said it was important to have all documentation when gaining citizenship. “Sometimes these kinds of problems occur when people bring old documents with old dates. We can’t use those.” He said he can only be helped if he has all the documents.
