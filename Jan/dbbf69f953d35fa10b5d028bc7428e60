AFRICA is mourning the death of famous Zimbabwean musician Oliver Mtukudzi. He died at the Avenues Clinic in Harare yesterday, aged 66, after battling diabetes. Mtukudzi was working on his 67th album. Former Zimbabwean culture minister David Coltart was among the first to pay tribute to him.“Rest in peace, Oliver. If anyone ever made me proud to be Zimbabwean it was you. “Thank you for making us happy for so long, especially during the darkest days.” Mzansi musicians expressed sadness at his death. Actress Khanyi Mbau tweeted: “Rest in peace, king. Your legacy lives on.” Commenting that his death came exactly a year after the legendary Hugh Masekela’s death, singer Thandiswa Mazwai said: “RIP to a most humble and incredible musician whose music was loved around the world.” Zimbabwe Exiles Forum director Gabriel Shumba said: “Mtukudzi’s music transcended borders.”– CAJ NEWS
