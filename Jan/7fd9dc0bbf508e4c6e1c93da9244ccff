THE year has started just as if the holidays never happened. And we know because the traffic is back too. Eugene Herbert, managing director of MasterDrive, said: “Defensive driving is the only safe way to drive. It teaches you to be prepared to defend yourself and your car from threats on the road." Awareness Always be aware of your surroundings and drive with a 12 to 15 second gap between you and everything before you. “If you drive with a gap, you have room to manoeuvre. If you don’t, you’ll be dead or injured before you even realise there’s a problem.” Driving techniques Drive using techniques that help you avoid dangerous events. “Drive with an escape plan. Whether you are sitting still at a robot or driving on the highway, never let other vehicles trap you in a box. If something goes wrong, your escape room will save you.” Focus “Focus your attention on your routes and roads. Plan your routes and leaving for work on time so that you are not driving in a panic because you are late. “Keep all other forms of distraction away from you such as your phone, tablet, radio, makeup or eating food and drinking coffee while driving. “In the time it takes to look at a text message you have driven more than 120 metres.” Maintenance Poor maintenance makes your driving worse so keep it up to date at all times. Also perform regular checks on items such as windscreen wipers and tyre tread so you know how ready your car is to take on all conditions and situations like unexpected rain or damaged roads. “We applaud drivers who made use of all of these skills and tips and encourage them to continue to drive by these excellent principles this year. “We can set an example to other road users and those in the car with us by driving better and doing our part to reduce dangerous and deadly collisions on the road.”
