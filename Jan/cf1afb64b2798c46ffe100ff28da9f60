THE ANC in eThekwini region has vowed to discipline party members who support a councillor accused of murdering another party councillor. Umlazi ward 80 councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza and his two relatives have been charged with the murder of ANC ward 88 councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo in October. They appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court for a bail hearing. Their arrest has divided ANC members as some support the dead councillor’s family, while others support Nojiyeza and his relatives. Every time they appeared in court, scores of party members gathered outside the building. Some carried posters criticising the accused, while others demanded their release. This has angered the party and it has promised to deal with members harshly. ANC eThekwini regional secretary Bheki Ntuli told Daily Sun yesterday that those party members who went to court and supported people suspected of killing a councillor were going against the organisation’s position. “The ANC has noted that some party members have undermined the party position by openly supporting the murder suspects in Umlazi court. The members are embarrassing the organisation and this can’t be tolerated because it creates an impression that we are a party of killers. Our members who are supporting suspects will be disciplined,” said Ntuli. Nojiyeza’s brother Ndumiso (28) accused Ntuli of double standards. He said they came to court to support the suspects because the party always said anyone was innocent until proven guilty. He said the party should not act as if his brother had already been found guilty. “We are not saying he has not done it but for now they are still suspects. That is why we support them,” said Ndumiso. Nojiyeza, Phumlani Nojiyeza (34) and Nkosinathi Mbambo (25) will be back in court today for continuation of their bail hearing.
