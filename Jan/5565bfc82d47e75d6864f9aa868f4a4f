A FONG kong doctor was bust on Tuesday afternoon and his surgery shut down. Cops told Daily Sun they had been investigating the doctor in Hillbrow, Joburg, for a while before they went after him. Police found patients queuing for medical assistance and chased them away. They also found medical aid claims, injections, medication and sick notes on the scene. Spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo told the SunTeam the bust came as a result of an intelligence driven operation. “We received complaints from the public that they did not trust this doctor and we started investigating. “His work looked suspicious and we took our time to make sure we collected as much evidence as possible.” The suspect was charged with going against the Health Professions Act, fraud and forgery. He was due to appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court today.
