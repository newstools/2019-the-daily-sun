TWO more people have been suspended from Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke in North West. The school became involved in a racism row last week after a picture of grade R children allegedly separated by race went viral on social media. Addressing the media yesterday, North West Education MEC Sello Lehari said he would announce the names of two more teachers who were suspended today after receiving letters of suspension. Lehari said although he supported the suspension of teacher Elana Barkhuizen last week for taking the photo, the decision was made by the SGB as they had employed her. “What decision the SGB will make after meeting Solidarity here or in court has nothing to do with me. I only express departmental decisions,” he said. “There will be investigations that will bring more names regarding racism at this school. The investigation into racism at the school could take up to six months.” The MEC had a meeting with parents yesterday and asked them to send their kids back to school. He urged them to allow cops to do their jobs. He’s expected to make more announcements today. Johannes Phutiaegae, a black parent, said the suspended teacher was good at her job and his son was in her class last year. He said the school had no history of racism.
