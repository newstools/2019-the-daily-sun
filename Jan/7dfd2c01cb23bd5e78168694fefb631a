GRANT beneficiaries stand to lose a lot of money due to card theft and scamming that happens when their cards are stolen. According to Sassa, many cases have been registered by those who have fallen victim to card-selling scams. Many beneficiaries have lashed a card scammer who uses Facebook to target new buyers. The fraudster sells each card for an amount of a R600 for a child grant and R1 500 for adults. The buyers use the cards to get R1 600 per month. Sassa spokesman Paseka Letsatsi told Daily Sun stolen cards have been blocked. He said the cards sold are normally stolen from beneficiaries and not from Sassa itself. “These are cards stolen during robberies and sold. “Sassa and the post office are working with the police and following leads that could lead to arrests. “The stolen cards are immediately de-activated and become worthless. “The public is warned not to be try and buy them as they are useless,” said Letsatsi. “No grants can be withdrawn from the stolen cards and anyone buying with them may be charged with possession of stolen property.”
