MOTHERS ululated and fathers whistled when the groom handed over the fat lobola cows. But the 24 lobola cows disappeared at the chief’s homestead at the end of successful marriage negotiations. Thankfully, good detective work resulted in the arrest of three men from Mount Frere, Eastern Cape, for stock theft. “Three suspects, aged 27, 35 and 53, were arrested for possession of stolen stock from Qokolweni Village,” said police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni. “The suspects appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates Court and two were released because they were prospective buyers and not associated with the theft.” Tonjeni said the cattle were reunited with their owner. He said police arrested two suspects, aged 33 and 58, in Flagstaff on Sunday after recovering three stolen cattle. Six stray goats were impounded at Qumbu pound while efforts to trace the owner were being undertaken. “Eight sheep were recovered at Ntshiqo and handed over to the lawful owner while another 11 sheep were found abandoned in an old vacant house in Mthatha,” said Tonjeni. Police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga appealed to members of the stock theft unit to intensify its operations and to catch the thieves. She warned the community to resist the temptation to buy stolen animals as they were promoting stock theft. “Buying stolen stock creates a market for thieves, and police have no option but to arrest the buyer and seller,” she said.
