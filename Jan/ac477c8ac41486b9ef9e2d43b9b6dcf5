The inaugural Cotton Festival is around the corner and the momentum is reaching it’s peak. The festival, founded by rapper, Riky Rick, is a one-of-a-kind celebration of South African hip-hop music, culture and fashion, everything that Riky is about. Unfortunately, Riky has announced this afternoon that the festival tickets are completely sold out. But if you were able to secure your tickets then you are in for a treat as more than 90 musical acts will take to the stage in performance. This is in addition to the fashion and graphic artists who will be present on the day.
