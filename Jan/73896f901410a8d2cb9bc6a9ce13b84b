SYLVIA Ramosonya (59) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, was attacked by a rat with muthi in its mouth. She told Daily Sun the rat bit her on the leg early last year. “It was just a minor wound, but it grew as time went by,” she said. She said the wound is now so big she can’t walk properly. “I’m in pain. Doctors, sangomas and prophets have failed to help me.” Sylvia said her dog was barking before the rat bit her. “It was during the day. I went out to check what was going on and found my dog fighting a rat,” she said. She said the rat left the dog and made its way to her. Sylvia said she noticed the rat had a red string around its neck. “Its mouth was black and it looked like it had muthi in it,” she said. She said the rat ran away quickly. “I didn’t take what had happened seriously. I washed the wound and went into the house.” Sangoma Jabulani Mthimunye said evil people send anything to attack a person. “Such muthi is dangerous. The purpose is to make her whole body rotten, starting with the leg. “She needs a powerful sangoma urgently before it’s too late.” Dr Cynthia Lesiba, a general practitioner, said a lot of things could prevent a wound from healing, including infection, malnutrition and diabetes.
