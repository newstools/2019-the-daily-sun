IT’S a long walk to school for pupils of Holela Secondary School in Glenmore, Mpumalanga. Pupils have been walking and hitchhiking since the school reopened. They told the SunTeam their school bus was nowhere to be found on the first day of school. No explanation was given. Dumisani Ndlovu (17) said they were often late for school. “We’re facing a huge challenge because the distance to school is too long. We’re forced to wake up early in the morning,” he said. David Mtshali (57), an angry parent, said the scholar transport bus has always been a problem. “Our kids are forced to walk a long distance to school, and at the same time they’re expected to perform well,” she said. Roads and transport spokesman Mxolisi Dlamini said MEC Gillion Mashego held a meeting with Santaco to address the disruption of scholar transport. “The department intends to establish a task team to look into the non-payment of scholar transport service providers.”
