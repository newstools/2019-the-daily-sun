THE rubbish is back in Neo Rakale’s yard and residents are angry. The people of Ga-Rankuwa zone 4, north of Pretoria have been complaining about Neo’s dirty yard for years. Daily Sun published a story about the house last year. Residents complained about their neighbour’s recycling, which turned his yard into a dump. They thought their problems were over when the councillor intervened and made sure the yard was cleaned. But that didn’t stop Neo Rakale (36) from continuing his recycling. The yard is now back to its old state and residents want Neo out of his house. They said the smell from the rubbish was unbearable. Lerato Molokoane (49) said: “The rubbish keeps flying around the street and into our yards. We can’t live like this. “We have raised our concerns for years but nothing has happened.” Neo said he didn’t see what the problem was. “I recycle for a living and this is my business. No one has the right to tell me what to do in my yard,” he said. Councillor Jabu Rammushi said they had cleaned the yard once, but Neo continued to collect rubbish. “I’ve supplied him with containers to put his recycling material in without making this place a dump.” Rammushi said he also found Neo’s relatives and asked them to intervene. “They said Neo doesn’t want to live with them.”
