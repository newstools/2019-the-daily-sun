NO one must speak after the president has spoken. This is the call from the ANC in KZN, which urged supporters of former president Jacob Zuma to respect the rule that states no one must speak after the party’s current president. Provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala asked Zuma’s supporters not to chant his name the way they did after President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke at the party’s 107th birthday celebration on Tuesday. Zikalala, who yesterday attended the Ebuhleni Nazareth Baptist Church service at Ekhenana Mountain in Ndwedwe, north of Durban, said some supporters thought the former president would address them after Ramaphosa. “We are hoping people will understand that traditionally nobody is allowed to speak once the leader has spoken. “We do not expect any problems at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. “Only the president will speak on behalf of the entire ANC,” said Zikalala. Ramaphosa was yesterday expected to visit Mandosi Combined School in Ndwedwe, where he was going to hand over stationery. He eventually cancelled. Journalists were also told he would join the Shembe pilgrimage at Ekhanana, but he did not show up.
