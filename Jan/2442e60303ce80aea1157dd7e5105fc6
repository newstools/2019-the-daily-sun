MZANSI motorists will more cents in their pockets as unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund shows a possible price drop. According to the Automobile Association (AA) this is even though the international price of crude oil has gone up since its low of 1 January. “The overall price is still lower than December's average and this reflects in the current data,” the AA said. The association says in addition, the Rand/US dollar exchange rate has strengthened from an average of R14.44 at the beginning of the year to around R14.20 now. “We expect this figure may fluctuate in the second half of January. The Rand continues to firm slightly and it's not clear what level oil will stabilise around. Whether this will work in favour of fuel users or against them remains to be seen,” the association said.
