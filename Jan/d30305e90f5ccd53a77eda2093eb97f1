THANDZEKILE Mthethwa is an unhappy gogo. This is because the 96-year-old’s pension apparently vanished from her Sassa card! The gogo from Ophondweni Village in Mbazwana, northern KZN, said at the end of last month she sent her son Patrick (46) to draw money so she could buy her orphaned grandkids new school uniforms. “I nearly collapsed when my son told me the transaction was declined several times and the cashier at the supermarket told him there was no money on the card.” Gogo Thandzekile said last week Sassa officials visited her and told her their system showed a new card was issued for her account on 22 December and all her money was withdrawn in Isipingo, Durban, on the 28th. She said she was very confused as she had never been to Durban. “I don’t know who did this to me, but I blame Sassa as I don’t know how they allowed this to happen. This is fraud and I want justice.” Patrick said the situation was making life very difficult for their family. “We use this money to buy gogo nappies and special food she eats.” He said their family had nine members, including orphaned grandkids, and they used the money left over from his mum’s expenses to buy groceries. “We are pleading with Sassa to investigate this matter.” KZN Sassa spokesman Vusi Mahaye advised gogo Thandzekile to open a case with the police. “She must make an affidavit and bring it to us. We will then investigate,’ said Mahaye.
