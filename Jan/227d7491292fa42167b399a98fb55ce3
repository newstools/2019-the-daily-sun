THE Institute for Sustainable Risk Management wants to turn the lives of young people around. These were the words of the institute’s senior campus manager, Lebohang Mokhomo. He was speaking to about 800 young people at Phuthaditjhaba Multi-purpose Hall in QwaQwa, Free State. According to Lebohang, their goal is for the youth to have formal qualifications that would enable them to create jobs for others. He said at the same time, they wanted young people to be in a position to eradicate poverty in their communities. He said they chose QwaQwa because more that 90% of educational opportunities are found in Gauteng, while QwaQwa was often left out. “Our aim is to see all towns in the Free State benefit from this opportunity,” he told Daily Sun. Lebohang said all courses would be available at a new college which is to be opened, and students would not pay registration or tuition fees. He said they had two colleges so far, but needed about 10 to accommodate more students. “I’ve been dreaming about receiving such an opportunity and God answered my prayersI am interested in studying agriculture because it’s one of the important sectors in the country,” said Elizabeth Nhlapo (23), one of the candidates.
