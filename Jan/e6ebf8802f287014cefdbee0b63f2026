THE patients aren’t hoping to get better but are worried about getting even sicker! A video taken by a Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital patient in Soweto shows cockroaches all over a wall in ward 38. “We’ve got cockroaches and there’s no hygiene here. This place stinks and we’re sick. There’s a cockroach on my leg as we speak,” said the patient. The patient also took pictures of toilet floors that looked as if they had been flooded with water and hospital gowns were used to soak up the water. Daily Sun spoke to other patients with similar complaints. Ntombikayise Mbatha (28) said she gave birth at the hospital four months ago and there was blood and dirty hospital gowns on the floor and toilet basins. “The place stinks and there are babies in that ward.” Another woman said she gave birth two years ago and had to wear a gown stained with someone else’s blood. “We’re being exposed to unhygienic standards because we have no money,” she said. Spokesman Zenzo Ndabula said a fumigation team cleans all hospital areas and the ward was fumigated on 8 January. “The problem is made worse by food brought for patients ending up in lockers. “The fumigation team is in the ward and all patient lockers have been removed and cleaned.”
