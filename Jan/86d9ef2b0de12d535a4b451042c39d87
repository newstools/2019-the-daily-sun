PARENTS have locked the gates and taken the keys, saying they will not unlock the school doors until they are taken seriously. Children at Tsunyane Primary School in Lekgalong, near Rustenburg in the North West, have not been to school for two days. This is because of the terrible condition of the toilets. Parent Kedisaletse Maseko (40) said they were shocked when they visited the school last week. When they wanted to use the toilets they made a terrible discovery. “There were worms everywhere and the children are expected to use these toilets,” said Kedisaletse. According to parents, the school has been struggling without water since February. Emails, text messages and calls made to North West Education spokesman Freddy Sepeng went unanswered.
