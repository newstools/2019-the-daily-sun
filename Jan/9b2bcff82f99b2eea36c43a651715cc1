Sello Chokoe has been sacked as Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) head coach, the club have confirmed. Tshakhuma have lost patience with Chokoe after a string of disappointing results which have seen Vhadau Vha Damani slip down to fifth on the table with 27 points after 18 games. Chokoe was given his marching orders after Tshakhuma played to a 1-1 draw with TS Galaxy yesterday Tshakhuma were one of the National First Division's pacesetters at the start of the campaign, but have since been struggling with consistency. They have failed to win any of their last five matches As the wins began to dry up, Chokoe was reminded of the mandate he was given at the beginning of the season which was to secure a place in the promotional playoffs if they failed to gain automatic promotion to the elite league at the end of the season. With the likelihood of that seemingly fading with the recent spate of disappointing results, management have decided to cut ties with the former Baroka coach. “We have parted ways with Coach Sello Chokoe,” Tshakhuma’s marketing and Communications manager Livhuwani Madzuhe confirmed to SunSport. “We had a meeting on the fifth of January with the coach and his team because we as management were not happy with the team’s recent results. Things needed to change and we had a discussion that we would give them two more games to try and turmn things around but both games ended in draws and so we decided to let them go.”
