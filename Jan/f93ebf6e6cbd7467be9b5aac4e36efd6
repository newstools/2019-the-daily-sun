THEY LOST everything we worked hard for many years. Their four-roomed shack of Thembisile Ngwenya was destroyed by a fire in Standerton, Mpumalanga, on 23 December. All her clothes, food and R1 500 she had been saving were reduced to ashes. Thembisile’s boys survived the fire as they were not home. “My heart pains when I think of how we lost everything we worked so hard for. “We are relieved that no one was hurt,” she said. She said the fire, which could have been vutha, destroyed furniture, groceries, clothes, identity documents, birth certificates, bank cards and other important documents. “We are homeless with no money to build another shack and replace what we lost,” she said. Thembisile said she did not have a paraffin stove or a gas cylinder inside her shack. She said she had been living peacefully with her neighbours and did not suspect them. Thembisile is unemployed and relies on her two children’s grants to survive. She said she could not afford to even consult a sangoma or prophet. “This Christmas was the worst for me and my children because we had to rely on Good Samaritans to help us with food and other things,” she said. Thembisile appealed for any help from the community to get their lives back on track.
