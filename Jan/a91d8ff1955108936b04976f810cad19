THE badly injured boy was rushed to the clinic, but it was closed. On Monday Ayanda Gumbi (6) from Madadeni in Newcastle, northern KZN, died at the gate of the day clinic. The boy’s family said he would still be alive had the clinic been open. On Tuesday angry residents threatened to burn the clinic down. People demanded that it should stay open 24 hours. Aunt Lindeni (33) said the boy was playing with his friends in a park when a steel pipe fell on him. She said: “Residents called me to say Ayanda was injured. “I found them taking him to the clinic and joined them.” But the clinic, which closes at 6pm, was closed and the guard gave them an ambulance phone number. “We called it to take Ayanda to hospital and waited outside, but it didn’t come,” she said. “The distance from the clinic to the hospital is about 7km. “If the clinic was open 24 hours, Ayanda could have been saved.” KZN cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said residents protested outside the clinic after the boy died. “They complained that, had it been open, the child would have been saved,” Zwane said. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: “Madadeni Clinic is one of those that close at 6pm. “Residents know they can go to Madadeni Hospital after the clinic is closed.”
