THE church erected a big tent next to the squatter camp two weeks ago. But the people of Zenzele, near Mayfield in Daveyton, said the church should pack up their tent and leave the area. “That space is meant for RDP houses,” said a resident. “We heard the church has been expelled from many areas before coming here.” On Monday, Mayfield Square Shopping Centre had to be closed due to a protest nearby. Residents accused Ekurhuleni municipal officials of taking bribes in exchange for land. They told Daily Sun the tent was erected last month. Community leader Bakabaka Zwane said they wanted the municipality to remove their local councillor. He said they had invited the chief whip to come to the area, but he didn’t come. The church pastor refused to speak to the SunTeam. Police spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube said no property was damaged and nobody was hurt. “Cops are still monitoring the scene.” Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said: “The land is zoned as a church site. There are formal processes in place to deal with churches requiring land. “The church pastor bought the land after following due process.” He said allegations of bribery were viewed in a serious light. “It’s a vehicle to continue misinformation against the pastor.” He said residents were told about the sale of the land last month.
