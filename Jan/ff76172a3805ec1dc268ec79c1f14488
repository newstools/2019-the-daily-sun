FORMER Bosasa top boss Angelo Agrizzi says government was
defrauded by the ruling party in order to use the money for electioneering purposes. According to Agrizzi, in order to make cash for
electioneering a government social services department would pay Bosasa for
non-existent software programme. Agrizzi explained that there was no additional expense for
the software system, because it was already there. The people authorising the payment in government knew there
was nothing to pay for. Following that part of the funds would then be paid to the
official who requested cash for elections. Agrizzi told the commission that in a North West transaction
which totaled R3.4 million, about R1.8 million went on to pay for ANC
electioneering. He says it was difficult even for a forensic auditor to pick
up the discrepancies at Bosasa. Agrizzi says the profit margins at Bosasa were exceptionally
high, profit would still reflect 28% - 32% and even pay out bribes of R4
million through the books. He added that auditors were happy, and did not raise any eyebrows.
