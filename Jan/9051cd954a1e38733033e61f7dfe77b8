IF THE 2018 matric class do not see their details in newspapers tomorrow, they should not take their own lives. The message comes from the KZN Education Department, which has urged all matric pupils to use other avenues. Sihle Mlotshwa, a spokesman for the department, said they had many programmes in place that they were going to outline after the release of the matric results tomorrow. “We have initiatives like the second chance programme where matric pupils who did not make it last year are given an extended chance to rewrite failed subjects. But all that will be outlined after the official release of the results tomorrow,” said Mlotshwa. He pleaded with residents and families to stop putting unnecessary pressure on the matrics who were expecting to get their results. “Most of the times these kids take decisions to cut their lives short because of the pressure they get from their communities, families and relatives. “As the department, we are saying that is totally unnecessary,” said Mlotshwa. He said matrics should always remember that there were many successful people who never made it the first time they wrote matric. “Failing matric is not the end of the world.”
