ALL his life, Buyile Jani (52) has been fishing – but he never thought he would ever be attacked by a fishing hook! On Thursday, Buyile got tangled up in his fishing line while fishing in the Blesbok River near Springs. “I found myself tangled up in the line and the hook. I slipped and fell into the water,” said the fisherman from Jacobs Farm. “My friend tried to save me but I told him to call the cops.” Only Buyile’s head was above the water and if it hadn’t been for two uniformed cops from the Springs cop shop, who jumped into the water to save him, Buyile may have drowned. Buyile was taken to a local hospital to be treated for trauma and cold. He has since been discharged. “I love fishing but I don’t think I will ever fish again,” he said. Captain Johannes Ramphora said two cops rushed to the scene. Warrant Officer Wynand du Toit said they had to swim over to save Buyile. “Otherwise he would have drowned.”
