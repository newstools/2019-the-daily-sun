MOURNERS couldn’t hold back their tears as three victims of a train crash were buried on Saturday. Dick Sekoma, Sarah Sekoma and Samuel Boloyi died after two trains travelling from Mabopane, Tshwane, collided two weeks ago. The three were laid to rest in Soshanguve. During the week, Transport Minister Blade Nzimande visited the Sekoma family and demanded answers from Prasa. Mourners criticised the company, saying trains were in a poor condition and the service offered unreliable. The funerals were attended by Prasa and transport department officials. Transport department director general Chris Hlabisa said Prasa would make train safety a priority. He appealed to the public to help fight cable theft and vandalism of the railway lines. “Our hearts are broken and your loss and pain is ours too,” he said. He said community leaders and residents should help those who were left orphaned by the crash. Sarah’s friend Annah Ndambakuwa (32) said the Sekoma couple loved each other and did everything together. “It was painful when I heard about their passing.” Sarah and Dick leave behind six children. Three of the children were with them at the time of the crash and are still recovering from their injuries. Johanna Hlongwane was released from hospital to bury her husband, Samuel. She was with her husband when the trains crashed and was left with a fractured ankle. She and Samuel have two children.
