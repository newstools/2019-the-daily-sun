AS thousands of ANC members attended the party’s 107th birthday celebration at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday, SACP and ruling party supporters staged a protest. The protestors from ward 4 of Inchanga, west of Durban, sneaked into the stadium with placards criticising the ANC. One of the placards read: “We are tired of leaders that were imposed on us.” On Friday ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule warned supporters that divisive placards and shirts would not be allowed at the stadium. Young Communist League of South Africa regional chairman Kwazi Mdabe said they didn’t go to the stadium to celebrate. Mdabe said the protesters wanted high-ranking leaders to know there were still problems in Inchanga. He said many ANC members were prevented from renewing their memberships in 2014, which led to a lot of killings. He said many ANC supporters, who were also part of the South African Communist Party were not given membership. “We want President Cyril Ramaphosa to know that membership problems have existed in Inchanga since 2014. “We want national leaders to come to Inchanga to see this for themselves,” he said. Acting ANC national spokesman Dakota Legoete said the protesters were out of order. He said they should not have used the celebration as an opportunity to protest. Legoete said he did not know why they were allowed to bring placards into the stadium. He said provincial leadership would attend to the protesters’ grievances.
