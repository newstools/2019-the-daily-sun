THE suspended Laerskool Schweizer Reneke teacher Elana
Barkhuizen and trade union Solidarity are addressing the media. The North West primary school teacher Barkhuizen told the
media that her job is teaching, not politics. "My job is not politics, but teaching, my professions
is love for children, just because they are children," Barkhuizen said. Barkhuizen added that she walks with them every step of the
way, each year. “My heart breaks
every year when I have to say goodbye to them, but I am proud to see they are
ready for the next step," she said while wiping tears from her eyes. Addressing the media, Solidarity CEO Dirk Hermann said this
is a matter of extreme importance in South Africa and this case is about
building a democratic South Africa. Hermann said Solidarity is set to serve court papers before
the end of the week asking that the unlawful suspension Barkhuizen to be lifted
as a matter of urgency. According to Hermann, a ‘huge injustice’ has been done to
Barkhuizen and her family. "We want to appeal to South Africa to help restore her
dignity," Hermann said. Meanwhile, Solidarity head of legal services Anton van der
Bijl said they will file an urgent application to have Barkhuizen's suspension
lifted. He said the suspension did not follow due process and that
Bakrhuizen is employed by the governing body and not the Department of Basic Education.
