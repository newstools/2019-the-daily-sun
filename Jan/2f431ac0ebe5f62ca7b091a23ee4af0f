THREE men allegedly were forced to drink acid after being accused of hijacking taxis. They reportedly were kidnapped from their homes on Thursday and taken to Vosman outside eMalahleni, Mpumalanga. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said on Friday police went to investigate trouble in Hlalanikahle extension 2 and were told men were being kept in the area against their will. “While the police were checking the information, they heard the men were taken to a taxi rank in extension 11. “When they arrived, they were told bodies were stashed at the taxi operators’ offices.” Hlathi said police investigated and the allegations were confirmed. “It was first reported that four men were kidnapped. Three bodies were found. “The surviving man told police their attackers beat them and forced them to drink acid. He was taken to hospital. “The allegations will be confirmed by the post mortem.” Hlathi said an investigation was under way and called on anyone with information that can assist with their investigation to come and talk to them. “Police have opened three cases of murder and attempted murder, as well as kidnapping, and are looking for the perpetrators.”
