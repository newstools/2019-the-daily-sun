After a
statement emerged last week, that 216 nurses finishing community service at
Gauteng state hospitals will face unemployment. On Monday
the Gauteng Department of Health said it has put measures in place to fast
track the filling of community service nurses. The
department said out of the 650 stimulus package posts, 240 will be used to
absorb professional nurses. The
announcement was made by the Head of the Department, Mkhululi Lukhele. He said the
role of nurses is important in the healthcare system, adding that they are the
heart and soul of the system and the department will continue to priorities
them. Lukhele
said negotiations between the Gauteng Department of Health, private sector and
Non-government organisations (NGOs) are ongoing and at an advanced stage to ensure
that the remaining number of community service nurses are contracted to serve
the public. He said:
“Although the implementation of our recovery plan is beginning to bear the
fruits, it is appropriate to share that the Department is not yet out of the
wounds.” He said the
department is faced with a challenge to manage the high Compensation of
Employees (COE) costs. “Our COE
budget is currently accounting for just over 60% of the total departmental
budget and the status quo is making it difficult to create new posts or absorb
all professionals who completed their community service,” said Lukhele. He added:
“Amidst all the challenges, I would like to assure the affected staff members
that we are working around the clock to resolve all the hindrances related to
the placements. I would like to appeal for their patience and cooperation at
this crucial time.”
