BAROKA FC head coach Wedson Nyirenda has lambasted his players, accusing them of “thinking they are bigger than the game” after their maiden Telkom Knockout last month. “Nobody was playing from my team today,” he was referring to their 2-1 loss at the hands of Black Leopards in the Absa Premiership at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. “They were just walking on the field. The complacency has chipped in already. My players think they are bigger than the game after our history of winning the Telkom Knockout. I told them to quickly forget about TKO as there are more greater things in football.” He questioned their inconsistency of winning the knockout cup but continue languishing at the relegation zone. “We have to move from the position we are on, and quickly,” he said. Nyirenda has promised to tweak his team around when they meet Cape Town City at the Cape Town Stadium over the weekend. “A lot will change,” he declared. “What is more important is to change the attitude and the thinking of the players. You can have a good planning and tactics on the game, but if the attitude is not good, there’s nothing you can do. All teams want to test us on how we won the TKO cup.” Defeat by Lidoda Duvha have seen Baroka drop from 12th to 13th position on the log, with 14 points from 16 games. They are three points ahead of bottom side Maritzburg United. Nyirenda said: “The PSL is very interesting. You win two games and you will be up there. But you lose one then you will be in danger. So we have to fight and move away fast.”
