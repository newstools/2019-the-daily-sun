THE Right2Know organisation protested outside the embassy of Zimbabwe in Eastwood, Tshwane on Friday. Right2Know outreach organiser Bongani Xezwi said: “The picket is to demand that Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government stop their attacks on people who are simply exercising their right to protest against political and economic repression. “We also demand that Mnangagwa and his government immediately end the shutdown of the internet, which is a blatant attempt to silence the voices of the Zimbabwean people.” Xezwi said the organisation was calling on the government of South Africa to take a firm stand against what is going on in Zimbabwe. At least 12 Zimbabweans are thought to have been killed and 25 wounded during demonstrations against the 150% fuel price hike. According to experts, the hikes showed the government was bankrupt and desperate. Although the protests were mostly peaceful, there were incidents of looting and according to the government, attacks on police stations.
