SANA Ntlororo fears she might never walk again and wants justice! This after the 50-year-old from Extension 13 in Olivenhouthbosch, Tshwane, was hit by a bus. Now she wants to be compensated. Sana, who is a domestic worker, was hit by a Star Line bus in Doringkloof, Tshwane on 14 November. She was on her way to work. She claims the bus hit her while she was walking on the pavement and she ended up underneath it. She was admitted to Kalafong Hospital for more than a month. “Doctors said both my legs were broken. They put screws in them. I still feel pain,” said Sana. I’m also struggling to sleep. I’m worried I might not walk again.” The mum of four said the bus company management didn’t care about what happened to her because they never visited her in hospital or at home. Sana told Daily Sun: “I want the bus company to compensate me for what their driver did to me. Now I don’t have an income because of the bus driver.” Her husband, Simon Ngoma (51), said they were faced with hardship. “The bus almost killed my wife and they are not bothered to check on her. I borrowed money to pay for transport for her check-ups, food and other needs,” he said. “We need help to fight Star Line.” Star Line administration supervisor Stuurman Mahlangu said Sana should open a case at the cop shop. “The police will advise her what to do.”
