PUPILS from a school in KZN started the year on a good note. Their days of being bothered by rain and wind that swept through their classrooms while they studied are coming to an end. Zinqobele High School in Mthunzini, northern KZN will finally be able to fix their school’s broken windows, doors and cupboards, thanks to Gagasi FM. The radio station adopted the school as part of its annual back to school Geleza neGagasi campaign. The school received R30 000 from the station and another R50 000 donation from their partner CTM on Friday. As part of the campaign, listeners sent their motivation for schools in their communities they thought the station should adopt. A teacher from Zinqobele also reported the school’s plight and it was fortunately selected, making it the first school to be adopted by the radio station. Principal Ntombifuthi Mthethwa said the school needed urgent renovation. “With the generous donation we received, we will be able to fix windows and doors, as most of the classrooms have broken windows. We are really grateful for the donation,” said Mthethwa. Gagasi FM head of brand, Phinda Magwaza, said: “With the Adopt-a-School programme we aim to extend the impact of the Geleze neGagasi campaign beyond individual pupils who are beneficiaries of the back to school and back to study programmes.” CTM citizenship manager Landiwe Zondi said: “We hope that our contribution, with Gagasi FM, will make a difference.”
