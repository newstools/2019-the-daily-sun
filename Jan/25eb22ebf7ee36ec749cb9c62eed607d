KAIZER Chiefs needed an extra-time own goal to see off gutsy third-tier league side Tornado FC 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup at Sisa Dukashe Stadium yesterday. Attempting to clear a Gustavo Paez’s cross, Abongile Twani directed the ball into his own net, much to the relief of the nervous Amakhosi fans. Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns have already fallen, being knocked out of the first round for the first time in the tournament’s PSL history. What was supposed to be a walk in the park for the visitors turned out to be a real battle as Tornado went the distance with their illustrious opponents. They kept Amakhosi goalless for 90 minutes, until the fatal error led to the breakthrough for Chiefs. The likes of Bernard Parker could not find their rhythm, but debutant Happy Mashiane should be happy with his performance. Ernst Middendorp brought his top guns to Mdantsane, including Ramahlwe Mphahlele, who returned from a long injury lay-off. Willard Katsande marshalled the midfield Leonardo Castro partnered Parker upfront. But this was far from smooth ride for the Soweto giants, who were made to sweat by a third-tier side, much the same way they were given the run-arounds by Acornbush United two seasons ago. Amakhosi could not break down, let alone penetrate a resolute Tornado defence, marshalled by man of the match Lonwabo Mhlakaza. In fact, Chiefs survived a scare in the first half and got a big let off as Kefuwe Siyoko was wrongly ruled offside towards the end of extra time. But despite the disappointment, the ABC Motsepe League side walked off with their heads held high. They played one of the biggest games of their lives, making their role models dig deep for victory. With this sort of performance, they should go on to earn a spot in the promotion play-offs. Super Eagles 1-2 Bloemfontein Celtic.
