LIMPOPO DA leader Jacques Smalle and basic education shadow minister Nomsa Marchesi visited Letshega Mole Kwantele Secondary School in Ga-Matlala yesterday. Marchesi told Daily Sun she was worried the provincial education department was only focusing on schools that did well. “Letshega’s matric pupils camped under trees and their classrooms did not have a single teacher,” she said. She said the school’s story was an absolute tragedy that required immediate attention. “These poor pupils need to be rescued from this tragedy to make sure they accomplish their goals like other young people. “The school has no leadership and we therefore urge the education MEC to take action. “The school’s infrastructure is also shocking and it puts the lives of the pupils in danger,” she said Marchesi compared the school to a day care centre where children are dropped off by their parents in the morning and picked up in the afternoon without learning much. “This shows us that the pupils will not be learning anything throughout the year,” said Marchesi. “To rescue the pupils, the department has to move them to a school that’s closer to where they live. “The department must also provide transport for them,” she said. While Marchesi was conducting the oversight inspection, Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe was visiting some of the best performing schools in the province. She said she was disappointed the department had never set foot in schools that performed poorly. Smalle said such a situation was proof that the department does not care about the youth’s future. “The government needs to come on board quickly to ensure the future of these pupils is protected,” she said. For the first time in seven years, Eastern Cape was not the worst performing province in the country. The bottom spot was taken this year by the Limpopo province, which managed to registered a 69.4% pass rate.
