A  STONE meant to chase away a chicken cost a man his life. Jacob Botela (44) mistakenly killed a neighbour’s chicken when he was trying to scare it off – and the angry neighbour allegedly hit him with a hammer on the head and ribs. Jacob, from Spring Valley in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, died from his injuries on 16 January. The chicken was apparently eating from a plate of food meant for his sick son. The man’s family said they couldn’t believe a human being was actually killed over a chicken. Jacob’s widow Monica Mabunda (30) told Daily Sun the man didn’t give Jacob a chance to apologise. “Jacob was taken to the Impungwe Hospital, but he died later that day,” said Monica. Jacob’s brother Crinildo (41) said his brother was willing to pay for the chicken. “But that man still attacked him,” he said. Jacob will be buried in Mozambique. Sergeant David Ratau said a case of murder was opened and a 37-year-old man was arrested.
