WITH the hands resting on his hips, Ronwen Williams looked like someone who had lost a fortune at the Sun Met horse-racing. The SuperSport United goalkeeper cut a forlorn figure following yet another disappointing cup outing for Matsatsantsa a Pitori – this time a 2-0 Nedbank Cup defeat to Cape Town City FC at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. But Williams probably wished he’d spent his day sipping on cocktails at the nearby Kenilworth racecourse than to suffer another bleak night between the poles. The season that started positively for United, with the top-eight cup final, is crumbling down. Their chances of lifting a trophy appear slim after their Last-32 round exit in the Ke Yona Cup. Like his teammates, Williams can’t figure out how United moved from producing an improved performance against Bloemfontein Celtic last week to a lethargic display in a matter of days. “It’s very disappointing. This is not on. This team (City) has now beaten us four times this season,” said a glum Williams, who has previously won the Nedbank Cup twice with Matsatsantsa. “I tried keeping my team in the game... not to concede more goals. But we couldn’t score.” Pressure, however, is mounting on coach Kaitano Tembo, whose position is becoming untenable. On 26 points after 18 games, United trail log leaders Bidvest Wits by eight points. It looks like only a good league run will keep Tembo in the job. Said Tembo: “We have to try and improve our league position, keep up with the leading pack. “We just have to collect as many points as possible to finish in a respectable position. “I haven’t been given any target other than to do better than we did in the league last season.” McCarthy, who is in the radar of United, has praised his men, saying the scoreline could have been far worse for Matsatsantsa. Thabo Mokeke and Thamsanqa Mkhize netted for the Citizens. McCarthy reserved special praise for young defender Keanu Cupido, who kept Bradley Grobler out of the game.
