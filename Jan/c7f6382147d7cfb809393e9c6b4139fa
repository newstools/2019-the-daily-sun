IN a graveyard, the dead are supposed to be underground. But on Friday, a passerby at Atteridgeville Cemetery in Tshwane found a body lying on the ground. After the passerby alerted them, cops found it to be the body of a woman in her 40s. Constable Tumisang Moloto said: “The passerby found the body at 6am and immediately told the authorities”. Moloto said police think the victim was hit with a sharp object as she had injuries on the upper body and her clothes were ripped apart. “We cannot rule out rape but it will be determined by the forensic report. “The motive and circumstances surrounding the incident will be investigated.” He said police are appealing for help with information after a case of murder was opened. Moloto said residents have identified the body but her name will be withheld until the family is informed.
