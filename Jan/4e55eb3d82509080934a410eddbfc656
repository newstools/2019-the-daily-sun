RELATIVES of a man shot dead at Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban, have called for police to be alert at the hostel. On Sunday, Lucky Xolo and Siniko Mbuthuma were shot on the veranda at Glebelands’ block 50. Siboniso Dlamini (31), who lives at the hostel, said the men were killed by gunmen while sitting outside Lucky’s room. “I heard gunshots but didn’t want to go outside immediately because I feared for my life. When I went outside, I was shocked to find my cousin was shot. “We all know how ugly it’s been but it’s been quiet, so we relaxed. We call on the cops to be on their toes once again.” According to unconfirmed rumours, the two were shot because they refused to pay donations for the Glebelands Eight on trial in Pietermaritzburg. These payments allegedly range from R50 to R100 and are collected every now and then to help with the arrested suspects’ legal fees. Siboniso told the SunTeam it was the first time he’d heard of these rumours. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “Umlazi cops are investigating two cases of murder after the killing of two men.”
