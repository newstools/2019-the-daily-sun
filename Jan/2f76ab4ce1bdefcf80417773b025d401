Councillor Thabisile Nkwanyana has urged people to stop buying fake proof of residence letters, and those selling them to stop. The Ndwedwe Municipality councillor was speaking to Daily Sun at the Verulam testing ground, north of Durban, yesterday. “I was alerted to the matter in November last year. I got a call from concerned residents to see if I was aware that proof of residence letters with my name and signature were being sold at the testing ground.” Nkwanyana said she tried doing her own investigations by going there and pretending to need a letter. “I think they know me because they simply told me they didn’t sell any letters,” she said. She said she was told the bogus letters were being sold for R50. She said she suspected someone from her office was working with the sellers as she’s never issued a blank letter because it was against the law. “I’m seeking legal advice from the cops and municipality about what steps I can take since I don’t have proof of what’s happening.” The SunTeam spoke to someone at the station who said he had bought a letter as he had forgotten to bring one from home. Ndwedwe mayor Nkosinathi Chili said they had received complaints but didn’t have proof. “We blame people who buy these letters because they know they are not for sale. We urge anyone who’s been affected directly to come forward so we can report the matter to the cops.”
