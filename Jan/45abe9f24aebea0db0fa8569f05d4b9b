FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Tumelo “Ryder” Mofokeng is fighting for his life. The 45-year-old was admitted to the Zamokuhle Private Hospital in last year November for an undisclosed illness. His close friend, Push Mokoena, told SunSport he is worried about the former Tembisa Classic player’s state of health. He said: “Ryder was admitted on 23 November. It’s been a long time since he’s been there. If he’s not well, we all feel it because he’s such a bubbly guy. He told me he will be released on 14 January and I wish him speedy recovery as he is the only one left at home after his mum and dad past away.” Mofokeng made his professional debut with Classic in the 1998-99 season. He also played for FC AK and the Brazilians prior to his retirement from the game at age 35. Mofokeng had something to fall back on when the ball stopped rolling as he is a qualified teacher. He satred teaching in 2011 at Moduopo Primary School until he became ill. He also received a teacher’s recognition award in 2016 for his dedication and excellence to serving the community of Tembisa. Former Orlando Pirates striker Jerry Skhosana is also saddened by Mofokeng’s ill-health. He said: “I was told by a friend during the Philly’s Games final that Tumelo is not well. He’s a humble guy who is gifted, considering he played in the professional ranks and is also a teacher by profession. “Since he arrived at the school he has put them on the map. I was impressed by his input when we attended meetings at the school and the community sang his praises. He is a good advisor, father figure and I wish him well.” Mofokeng’s former teammate at Classic and friend Martin Matsetela told SunSport: “Ryder has fully recovered and will be discharged from hospital anytime from now. “He’ll go back to school to do what he loves, teaching kids.”
