LEBOHANG Rantja always thought he would be a cop but instead he followed his passion and began creating beautiful crafts. The 30-year-old from Bluegumbosch in QwaQwa, Free State, makes flowers, houses and nature scenes. Lebohang, who has one child, told Daily Sun his desire to be an artist started when he was just a boy at school and drawing in the classroom. “A teacher told me I should focus on my talent but I didn’t take her advice seriously. “But then I grew up and I realised I had gold in my hands that could change my family’s life.” He said people should focus on their talents because not everybody can get formal jobs. Lebohang said education played a vital role in art and one shouldn’t simply rely on talent. “We can all draw or create cartoons but art isn’t for everyone. “It needs patience, passion and the ability to work together with many different people.” He said he faced many challenges, just like everyone else.
