ALFRED Maponya is terrified he will end up drowning in debt with no way out. This is because the 74-year-old from Lephepane Village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, has not been getting his pension grant since November, forcing him to borrow money from friends. “The first time I didn’t get my money, I went to Sassa to find out what the problem was. I was told someone had withdrawn my money from an ATM,” he said. “I was later told the problem had been fixed and I would receive my money but when I went to get it last month, there was nothing. I went to the branch again and was told the money had once again been withdrawn at the same ATM. “I don’t know who withdraws my money as I always have my Sassa card with me.” He said he suspects someone had made a copy of his card. “I have been sent from pillar to post by Sassa officials with no success. I was told I might not even get my money this month.” Sassa spokesman Zwannda Kutama said: “We are investigating the case to find out what could be the issue so we can resolve it.”
