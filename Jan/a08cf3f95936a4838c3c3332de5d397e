PROPHET Shepherd Bushiri’s church did not comply with safety regulations. This is according to outgoing Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga, who testified at the CRL Rights Commission in Braamfontein, Joburg, yesterday. His testimony was supported by a report from inspections conducted by the city on 9 January. The commission is trying to establish what led to the death of three people at Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering Church on 28 December. “The chief of emergency services and the Metro police chief were instructed to take the relevant people to conduct the inspection. “The report indicates that the routes leading to the escape door were obstructed, there was insufficient firefighting equipment, and no emergency lights were provided by the facility,” he said. He said there were no proper seating arrangements at the church, and judging by the number of chairs there were many people at the sermons. “The city will issue an order for the church to comply. If the levels of compliance have not been met after 30 days, it might result in a prohibition notice being issued.” Bushiri appeared at the commission on Monday, claiming the church adhered to all safety measures during the stampede. Tshwane Sanco chairman Abram Mashishi said the organisation wanted the church to remain closed until investigations were complete.
