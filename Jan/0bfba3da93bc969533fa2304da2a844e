A PUPIL from Phandulwazi High School in Lower Crossroads, Cape Town was found with dagga when the cops conducted a back- to school operation this week. Cops from Philippi East Police Station visited three schools around the area. Colonel Bongani Mtakati said they conducted the operation because most kasi pupils are ill disciplined. “Before the operation, we first visited the schools. Teachers complained that some kids were misbehaving because of drug use,” said Mtakati. “We want pupils to know that the operation won’t stop. “They must only come to school to learn and forget about other things because we are going to arrest them,” said Mtakati. Principal Cynthia Booi of Phandulwazi said that the operation will help a lot because some pupils bring dangerous weapons to the school. “We were happy when we saw cops at the school. “The operation will also help to tackle incidents of pupils who attack teachers.” Zamayedwa Jaxa, a principal at Phakama High School, said: “The operation will make kids think twice before they bring unwanted things to the school. “Now there will be change at the school.”
