THE death of a man who was electrocuted on top of a train near Philippi railway station in Cape Town caused delays. Masibulele Mgoqi (37) said commuters were on their way to Cape Town when the train stopped just before it reached Philippi station. “We thought there was a mechanical problem until we saw a big fire on top of the train. People were screaming that a Rasta was on fire. “We can’t claim he was train surfing because everyone knows that spot is dangerous,” said Masibulele. Sakhumzi Jila (43) was frustrated because he was running late and some railway lines were closed after the incident. “Now we are suffering because someone decided to go on top of the train,” he said. He said the situation was made worse by the fact that Metrorail did not come up with a plan B. “They should have organised alternative transport for us because we were stranded and it wasn’t our fault.” Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said: “It was the first train of the day and it is unclear what led to the incident.” She said commuters were advised to find alternative transport between Chris Hani and Philippi as bus operators were unable to assist during peak hours. Police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk said the matter was being investigated.
