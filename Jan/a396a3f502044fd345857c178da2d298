The singer who has done exceptionally well in his music last, said hello to January in style he posted the first picture with the caption “Ngithi hello January hello!!” and the second picture with a different caption where he thanked God. The singer who is signed under Afrotainment owned by DJ Tira posted a picture on Twitter with his new Mercedes GLE 43 AMG.
