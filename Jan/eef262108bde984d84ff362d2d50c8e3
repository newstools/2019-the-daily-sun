AT a time when everyone is celebrating the new year, a 71-year-old madala has been confined to a trauma centre. That’s after a five-year-old child who was visiting Khubvi Village, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo in November last year, went missing. Madala Sondaha Sikhipha and two cattle herders were accused of killing him. The angry community allegedly attacked the three. After a beating Sondaha was taken to a local tea plantation, where a tyre was put around his neck and petrol poured over him, only to be saved by the police. Sondaha opened a case but so far no one has been arrested. This has angered his relatives, who have vowed to approach the police minister if the suspects are not arrested. Sondaha’s relative, Victor Nevumbani, thought the culprits would be speedily arrested and taken to court as they are known. “The suspects still roam the streets while the victims spent the festive season like bandits.” Limpopo police spokesman Lietenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe dismissed the complaints and said investigations are continuing.
