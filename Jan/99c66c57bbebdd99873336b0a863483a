ON SATURDAY, poor kids from Howick and the surrounding areas in the KZN Midlands enjoyed themselves. Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube entertained them at the Nelson Mandela Capture Site in the town. Dube-Ncube said providing festive cheer to over 100 kids from Umngeni Municipality was the best way to honour Mzansi’s first democratic president. She said it was good to see the kids’ excitement as they played games, received gifts and learnt about the importance of the site, the last place where Mandela was a free man before his arrest in 1962. The children were taken to see the world-famous sculpture at the site, where the MEC taught them about its importance and Madiba’s values, which she said they should try to follow. She said last year was the year of Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu and the best way to honour their legacy was by remembering our precious little ones, the inheritors of the new Mzansi. She said it was fitting for them to end the year at this important spot in our history. “The joy we saw today from the kids is a reminder that as leaders, we are only custodians and should ensure we educate them about our country’s history.” The department has invested millions in developing the Nelson Mandela Capture Precinct to provide economic benefits to Umngeni residents, as it attracts thousands of visitors a month. Parent Mabhuti Nhlapho (41) said he and his daughter Siphokazi (5) were excited that the MEC hosted the special day. “Siphokazi came back with a food voucher, toys and Nelson Mandela T-shirt. As an unemployed parent, I’m happy the MEC gave our kids toys we can’t afford.”
