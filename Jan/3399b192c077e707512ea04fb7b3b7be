MEMBERS affiliated to NUM in Blybank, outside Carletonville, Gauteng, are living in fear. This follows recent violent clashes in the area. Some fled their homes after 15 houses were burnt, allegedly by Amcu members. This has been happening since November. The latest house was set alight on Sunday. One of the victims told Daily Sun they sought refuge at a relative’s house. “We can’t go back to Blybank. We fear for our lives,” he said. He said they lost everything in the fire. “I wasn’t there when my house burned down. I couldn’t save anything because it’s dangerous to go to that area. I’m only left with these clothes on my back,” he said. Another victim said his three kids could not go to school yesterday because their uniforms burned in the fire. “Some of the kids travel to school by bus and we fear they might be attacked,” he said. Tension started after NUM and two other unions signed an offer from Sibanye Stillwater after talks. NUM branch secretary Bricks Kokone said workers would receive R700 for the first and second year and R825 for the third year. But Amcu rejected the offer and are currently on strike, demanding R1 000 increase each year for the next three years. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Peter Masooa said several people were bust for public violence and could be linked to arson. The suspects will appear in court today.
