ANGRY residents of Shaka’s Head protested outside the Umhlali Magistrates Court yesterday. They were there to oppose bail for a rape suspect (51). The man, who was a Sunday School teacher, was arrested in October last year after it emerged he had raped the victim (13) several times since August. The suspect, who is the victim’s neighbour, allegedly raped her at his house. The victim’s mum (39) told Daily Sun she didn’t want the suspect to get bail. “We knew him for about three years. He was a good Sunday School teacher and a friendly neighbour. When I discovered that he had raped my daughter, my heart was torn apart,” said the mum. She said her daughter was a virgin, so she felt the suspect buried her alive. She said she learned about the rape when she saw a R50 note in her daughter’s schoolbag. “I asked her where she got the money and she told me she got it from the suspect. I asked him why he gave my daughter the money, but he said she stole it from his house. “I then asked my daughter who taught her to be a thief and that’s when she told me that the suspect had been raping her. “He told her to take whatever money she wanted to keep quiet about the matter,” said the mum. Councillor Bonisile Majola, who was among the protesters, said: “We don’t want him to get bail. He doesn’t deserve to be around our kids.” The case was postponed to 14 February.
