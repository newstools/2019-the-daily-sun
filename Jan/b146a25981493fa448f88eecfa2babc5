Music legend Babsy Mlangeni wants to motivate disabled youths. On 30 January, he will officially open the Babsy Mlangeni Foundation to help children at disabled schools around Mzansi. Babsy told SunBuzz: “Disabled children have it hard because they can’t enjoy all the activities other kids take part in. “I saw a need to motivate these kids and empower them.” The Ba Kae singer, who was born blind, said he understands how disabled youngsters feel because he relates to them. “We noticed these kids are resentful and some of them have given up on life. “That’s why blind singer Steve Kekana and I will be motivating them, because if we could make it so far and be as successful as we are, they can too, despite their disabilities.” Through his foundation, Babsy will travel to all nine provinces to visit disabled schools. He told SunBuzz: “These children must also have fun and have dreams like other kids. We want other successful, well-known people to take part in the foundation and motivate them.” Babsy’s journey at the end of the month will kick off at Sibonile School For The Blind in Kliprivier, Meyerton. After that he’ll be visiting Filadelfia Secondary Special School in Soshanguve, Tshwane. “We’re still deciding on other schools to visit but so far, it is looking good,” Babsy said.
