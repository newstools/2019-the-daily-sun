UNHAPPY ANC members have gone to court to demand to be allowed to hold a regional elective conference. The members of branches in the Moses Mabhida region, KZN, took the matter to the Pietermartizburg High Court and it was postponed to 1 February. Branch leader Sithembiso Nkuna told Daily Sun they were forced to go to court because national and provincial leaders had refused to allow them to hold a conference. He said they took the decision after many months of engagement with the leadership. Nkuna said they had followed the required processes to hold a conference but the leadership was still refusing. “We want the conference before the general election in May,” said Nkuna. At a media briefing on Friday, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said he would deal with the unhappy branches in court. He said he didn’t understand why the comrades wouldn’t accept the NEC’s decision for all outstanding conferences to be held after the election for the party to focus on campaigning. “The ANC is a patient organisation. We will continue engaging these comrades. We will try to make them understand the ANC better. Once the NEC has taken a decision, it must be respected and accepted,” he said. “We will not rush to act against them, but we will continue educating them because when we decide to act, we don’t want people to say they didn’t know.” Magashule said a number of regions in other provinces didn’t have their conferences either, and were also told to wait until after the election. He said regions were given until 31 July last year to hold their conferences and the deadline was later extended to 31 August.
