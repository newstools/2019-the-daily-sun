A COUPLE who lost a ring containing some of their dead
son’s hair are overjoyed at getting it back again. According to New Zealand Herald, Mike and Kate Price had
been staying at a campground in the east of the country earlier this month with
their three surviving kids. On their last day, Mike took off his ring before having a
shower. Said Mike last Monday: "I don't usually take my ring
off. I actually thought at the time 'I mustn't forget that's there'. But when I
finished I gathered up my shampoo and everything and it must have been hidden
behind the door. "I'm kicking myself. We lost our son in June 2011.
It just feels like we've lost him again. It's quite hard going." The couple live in Feilding, about six hours' drive to
the Bay of Plenty. It wasn't until they were back home they realised the ring
was missing. Their desperate efforts to get hold of the campground and
ask them to look for the ring got nowhere because lightning had shut down the
phone lines. All they could do was wait. "The worst thing is if someone else might be wearing
it with our son's DNA, obviously they won't know, but the thought that he's
with someone else we don't know, that makes it hard as well," Mike said. "We were quite lucky to have three other children
but our son’s death is still quite raw." Then the miracle happened. "One of the cleaners found it and is putting it
aside for us," Mike said. "We are very relieved. It's like a weight being
lifted. "We are just so grateful. It's a Christmas miracle,
really."
