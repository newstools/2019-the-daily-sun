LOYISO Gola joined the fun on Netflix show Comedians of the World yesterday. The show, which was filmed in Montreal in Canada, has brought together 47 comedians from 13 regions. Other local comedians featured on the show are Loyiso Madinga, Tumi Morake and Riaad Moosa. “I travel the world all the time to do stand-up comedy. “The recognition is appreciated, as well as the opportunity to be part of such a big, global game-changer. “About 70% of the material is brand new, and some of it was an expansion of older stuff I hadn’t really done around the world yet. “There are different ways to approach a joke. You have to understand what makes people laugh in the first place. “There’s a reason certain types of jokes work really well, like the ‘three men walk into a bar’ structure. “It sets up your brain to think one way, and the third part of joke always has to be obscure. “The first part of the joke takes the brain in a certain direction. So the brain feels safe, and then it isn’t anymore. “You can use this technique in everyday jokes.” He said he was looking forward to seeing British comedian Martin Mae and Australian Urzila Carlson on the show. – NEWS24
