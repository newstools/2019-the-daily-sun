THE Eastern Cape MEC for Finance, Economic Developmen and Environmental Affairs, Lubabalo Mabuyane, adopted a high school in Tsomo on Wednesday. Zwelixolile Senior Secondary School was facing closure due to low pupil numbers. The school has about 102 pupils, far below the minimum number required. Mabuyane announced his decision during a meeting with education head of department Thembinkosi Kojana, teachers at the school, members of the SGB and principals of feeder primary schools around Zwelixolile. The school has a vacant post for maths, poor infrastructure and doesn’t have scholar transport. “My adoption of the school is not ceremonial but the start of a results driven programme to ensure that teaching and learning happen,” said Mabuyane. Kojana tasked the principal and principals of feeder schools to develop a plan to make the high school attractive to pupils and parents. “If the leadership and management of the school is not right, the school will not be attractive,” he said.
