THE young South Africans who drowned at Portuguese Island, Mozambique over a week ago have been buried. Mmatholo Mogafe (24) and her friend Lesego Matsepe (21) were buried yesterday in Groblersdal, Limpopo, while their friends David Kaise and Gregory Mfune were buried in Mpumalanga and the Free State on Saturday. The four were celebrating Mmatholo’s birthday with their friends Vincent Rammupudu from Groblersdal, Lesedi Mmotong, Basetsana Mogafe and Lefentse Mampuru from Tafelkop. The joint funeral at a Groblersdal rugby stadium was attended by Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha and Sekhukhune mayor Stan Ramaila. Survivor Vincent said it was hard for him, knowing his friends had died. “We organised the trip to celebrate Mmatholo’s birthday. “Little did we know we were bidding her and Lesego farewell and that our joy would be shortlived. “The journey to that country was so amazing. On the Saturday, Lesego and Mmatholo spoke to me when I was sitting on a bridge, where they warned me to stay safe.” Vincent left many in tears during his speech. He said Lesedi asked them to pray before they boarded the boat but Lesego told them when it’s your time, it’s your time. Mathabatha said he was shocked when he heard of the tragedy. “That island is dangerous. In the past 10 years, 20 people disappeared there and their bodies were never found. I lost hope of these bodies being found and it was a relief when they were recovered. “The weather there is unpredictable. “There should be signs warning people and advice on how to save themselves,” he said. Chief Boleu Rammupudu thanked the governments of Mzansi and Mozambique for their support. “All the bodies were found and are finally buried. They went there to enjoy themselves but didn’t know tragedy was on its way.”
