RESIDENTS and drivers said they can’t bear stubborn cows that roam their streets. Gatvol residents from KwaNyuswa, outside Durban, said the councillor should deal with the cattle because they leave dung on the road. Residents said the problem started last year. Simphiwe Ngcobo (49) said: “This is a busy road and the cows are sometimes hit by vehicles. “The problem is that we don’t know the owners of the cattle.” Another resident Nombuso Dlamini (37) said: “The councillor should find out who the owners are and tell them to remove their cows from this busy road.” She said it was even hard for kids to walk near the road because they were terrified of the cattle. Councillor Themba Shelembe said he wasn’t aware of the matter. “Cows shouldn’t be allowed on the road. I will call a meeting with residents who have livestock and tell them to remove their cows. “If they won’t comply, I’ll be forced to impound the animals,” he said.
