ASK most people what their plans are for this year and fitness and wellbeing will probably be the first words out of their mouths. Sibonile Dube, head of communications and public affairs at Novartis South Africa, said: “Most people start the year deciding to get fitter and healthier. But these empty gestures are usually replaced by excuses before June as they didn’t realise all the steps they would need to do.” Steps you need to take: Work your medical aid Make it your mission to study the benefits covered by your medical aid. Take advantage of discounts, free screenings, health events and other health-promoting efforts offered by your medical aid. If you have a chronic illness, double check the benefits and work out when your savings will run out so you can budget a little extra to save up for when it dries up. Take symptoms seriously If you find a growth or feel sick, don’t wait until it explodes with problems – get your problems checked out as soon as possible. You always pay less for treating a disease if it’s caught early enough. Check out your body Get screened and checked even if you feel healthy. Test your eyes, teeth, blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol. Women, get a pap smear. Men, get your prostate tested. Look after number one Wellbeing is more than exercise and a healthier diet but they are the core components. The World Health Organisation says regular exercise improves cardio and respiratory functions as well as muscular fitness and bone health. It reduces risks of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. The organisation recommends that adults aged 18 to 64 must do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity physical activity a week.
