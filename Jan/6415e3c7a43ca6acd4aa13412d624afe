EVERYTHING is going left and nothing is going right in his life! This after he got inbetween two men in the men’s bathroom in a restaurant in Braamfontein, Joburg. Botha Mabolane (44) said the incident changed his life for the worse. “I got inbetween two men in the men’s bathroom. One was washing the right hand while the other one was washing the left hand,” he said. “This happened in 2009, a few months after my dad died. I thought losing my dad was the worst time of my life, but things got worse.” Botha told Daily Sun he and his wife got divorced within a few months and he still doesn’t understand the reasons. “As if that was not enough, he lost his job in 2010. When I dream about my dad, he asks who I am. “This alone is traumatic. We were close before he died, and for him to not recognise me hurts.” Botha said although he has qualifications, he cannot get a job. He said he also got mugged recently. Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi, who said: “This kind of thing happens, but it’s nothing a traditional healer can’t deal with. He needs to consult a sangoma who’ll confirm what his problem is.”
