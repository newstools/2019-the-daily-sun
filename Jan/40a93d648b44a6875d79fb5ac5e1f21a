DJ TBOY isn’t happy with Dladla Mshunqisi. Dladla, whose real name is Anele Dladla, was billed for Tboy’s birthday event at Nobleman Park in Mpumalanga in September, but fans were let down. Tboy, whose real name is Thulane Khanye, said Dladla made the crowd unhappy with him. He said he paid him R25 000 to appear but he made the DJ seem a liar and had not made up for it. He said cops had to escort him as he feared for his life. “People weren’t happy. “It cost me a lot.” He said the crowd damaged speakers, a pool and VIP couches. Manager Nkule Shezi of Afrotainment, which represents Dladla, said Tboy had not called them but he would refund him as soon as possible. “Tell him to send us proof of payment and we’ll refund him.” Tboy claimed he’d called Afrotainment but they never answered or returned calls.
