LULEKA doesn’t want to die without ever experiencing the joy of good sex. The 42-year-old Luleka Majola from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, said all she’s ever felt was pain. She told Daily Sun she’s been to doctors but nothing works. Luleka has two kids, aged 10 and 12. But every time she has sex, it feels as if it’s her first time and she bleeds sometimes. Luleka believes she has been cursed. “Doctors said there’s nothing wrong with me. They give me painkillers, which only help me on that particular day,” she said. Luleka said after she had her second child, she consulted a prophet who told me her the ancestors were angry with her. “But the prophet couldn’t help me,” she said. She told Daily Sun she’s tried to have sex with men with smaller 4-5s, but the pain wouldn’t go away. Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi, who said that this type of condition had nothing to do with the ancestors. “Someone must have cursed her,” said the sangoma. “She can come and consult and I’ll give her a detailed explanation. “We’ll try and fix the problem.” Vinod Govid from Ahmed Kathrada Hospital told Daily Sun Luleka needed to consult a gynecologist. Vinod said this kind of problem was not unusual.
