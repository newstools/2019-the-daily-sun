Renowned South African actor, Hlomla Dandala has something that he’s been dying to get off his chest and what better place to get validation than Twitter. Hlomla, who currently stars as Zweli Dlamini on The River, has revealed that he thinks that it is very unjust for poor people to have to pay for the use of public toilets. According to him, this is an injustice to our human rights and it has to come to an end. “Who do we need to speak to to ensure that this practice of making people pay to use toilets is banned in South Africa? Poor people now suffer the indignity of paying to pee,” he said. He went on to engage people who had comments to make on the issue, maintaining his stance that is wrong and for some reason, only happens to the poor. ICYMI: HLOMLA DANDALA AND PAMELA NOMVETE'S TWITTER SHOWDOWN One user argued that the use of public toilets sometimes comes with a price tag so that the cleaners of said toilets can be paid. But Hlomla was not here for that logic either. “But in Sandton, where peeing is for free & the cleaners are always there, how do they manage it?” he probed. Another user claimed to know a thing or about the law on this matter: “As an architect, we are required to provide enough toilets for each building based on its use, size, and population, by law. Otherwise the plans simply won’t get approved by Council. Public buildings MUST provide free facilities to their customers, whether they like it or not,” he said.
