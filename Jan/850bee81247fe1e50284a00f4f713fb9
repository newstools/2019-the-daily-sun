NO miniskirts,
earrings, necklaces, bangles, sleeveless and open tops, coloured nails,
lipsticks, trousers and dresses. This is
the list of clothes and accessories that a varsity in Uganda has banned its
female students from wearing, threatening to take “serious action” against them
if they dare to! According
to Daily Monitor, Bugema University in Kampala laid down the law for what its
female students are allowed to wear on campus in mid December last year. In the
notice announcing the ban, the varsity said: “No student should come back with
the above mentioned next semester. Culprits will face university disciplinary
committee for serious action.” But the
move has been met with serious resistance. Student Ronald
Bwire was so upset by it he’s taken the varsity to court. In his
court papers, currently being argued in the High Court, Ronald states that the
ban is a violation of female students’ right to equality, dignity, freedom of
expression, conscience and culture. He also
argues that it’s a step back in Uganda’s efforts to respect, promote and uphold
the rights and status of women. He
further argues that the ban would cause female students undue distress,
physiological torture and inconvenience. The case
continues.
