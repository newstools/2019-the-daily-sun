PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday signed a proclamation to allow the Special Investigating Unit to look into the Life Esidimeni tragedy and 28 other mental health facilities. The unit will probe allegations of irregularities by Gauteng Health Department officials and Life Esidimeni employees. The Gauteng ANC said it welcomed the proclamation and hoped it would lead to accountability. Provincial Executive Committee spokeswoman Tasneem Motara said: “All state institutions tasked with investigating the Life Esidimeni tragedy act swiftly,” said Motara. She said the institutions must take appropriate action against those found guilty of breaking the law. Motara said the committee hopes the redress process will heal the wounds carried by the relatives of the tragedy’s casualties. The unit will also investigate possible wasteful expenditure by Umgeni Water in KZN.
