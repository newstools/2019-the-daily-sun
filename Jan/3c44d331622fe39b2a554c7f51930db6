POLICE need help to bust thugs who stole part of Mahlomola Hantsi’s tombstone. The theft was discovered by Mahlomola’s family when they visited his grave at Odendaalsrus cemetery on New Year’s Day. Mahlomola died in 2003. His son Ernest Hantsi (54) said the last time they visited their dad’s grave was in September and it was still intact. “At the time my son had just been promoted at work and we went as a family to say prayers at the graveyard. “My father’s grave was still in good condition,” Ernest told Daily Sun. “But when we went to the graveyard on New Year’s Day, we were shocked to see the damage. Part of the tombstone was stolen.” Ernest said his father’s grave was next to his younger brother’s. “My brother’s grave showed that someone was trying to steal the tombstone, but for some reason they failed.” Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng confirmed the incident and said that a case has been opened. Thakeng said: “We are looking for suspects after a grave was violated at Odendaalsrus cemetery. No arrests have been made yet. Anyone with information should call investigating officer Constable Ntsiki Madyongolo on 057 916 2400 or their nearest police station.”
