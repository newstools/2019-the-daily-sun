PITCH
BLACK AFRO has been arrested for the murder of his wife Trisha. Provincial
cops Spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed to Daily Sun that he is behind bars, charged with murder and will be
in court tomorrow. Daily Sun previously reported
that a source claimed Trisha could have been killed. The
source claimed the truth would soon come out and justice would be served. The
source said the incident happened on the morning of 31 December. “Pitch Black
and his wife were invited for drinks by a friend at a flat in Bellevue, Joburg
on the 30th. “They
were drinking for most of the night and then Pitch Black got into a small argument
with his woman. They left soon after that.” The
source said they booked into a bed and breakfast for the night, but the wife
came running back to the flat barefoot, looking disturbed. “When
she got there, they drank again for a couple of hours while Pitch Black was
sleeping. “The
wife was accompanied back to the BnB early that morning.” Another
source said he was called by his panicking friend, who told him the wife had
bruises all over her face and was not breathing. “She
looked like she was sleeping but was bruised all over. It was easy to see
because she was light skinned. I told my friend they needed to call an
ambulance and police. “Even
people who spent the night at the BnB said they heard noises from the couple’s
room.”
