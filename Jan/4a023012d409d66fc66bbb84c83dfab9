DRAMATIC video footage of Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson with R1 million on his desk was played at the state capture commission yesterday. Testifying to the commission in Parktown, Joburg, former executive Angelo Agrizzi said the money was for bribes to secure tenders. The video also shows Watson counting out R100 000 in cash. Agrizzi, who worked for the company until 2016, said he asked his former colleague and chief financial officer Andries van Tonder to film the video to protect himself. The footage was shot last year. Agrizzi said Watson would blame any wrongdoing in the company on former employees. “Watson never signed anything. He would say ‘you can’t pin anything on me’. Then he would sell you out,” said Agrizzi. “That is why we have this problem in this country. “Once you start bribing people on a monthly basis, you control them 100%.” He said it was drummed into them that they would be nothing outside Bosasa. “You were told you were a white male and you wouldn’t find a job anywhere. It was a cult,” he said. He said bribes were paid for every contract Bosasa got from the government except one or two. Agrizzi said one of the people he dealt with personally was former correctional services chief financial officer Patrick Gillingham, who was allegedly paid monthly.
