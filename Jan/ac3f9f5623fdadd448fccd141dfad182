DAVEYTON Mall in Ekurhuleni has been helping pupils cover their school books for free. Last week, kids were invited to bring as many books as they wanted to be covered. Since last week, volunteers have covered over 3 000 books free of charge. Mall marketing manager Sanele Zungu said the campaign was meant to end on Saturday but due to the high demand, it was extended to yesterday. Zungu told Daily Sun that they wanted to make sure no child in the area had to go to school with uncovered books. “We don’t only cater for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds because we understand there are a number of factors that lead to kids bringing uncovered books to school,” said Zungu.
