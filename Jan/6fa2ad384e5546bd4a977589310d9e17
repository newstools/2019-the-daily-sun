KEEPING cool as usual and with a smile on his face, Thulani “Pitch Black Afro” Ngcobo walked into the court with a new hairstyle. But it seems the rapper will have to hang in there as his bail application was postponed once again. He appeared in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday. He will make another appearance again today for allegedly murdering his wife Tricia Modisane. Modisane’s death was originally ruled as a natural death, but the pathologist handling the case later concluded that she died due to unnatural causes. Magistrate Paul du Plessis, who seemed irritated by the rapper’s behaviour, told Pitch Black Afro to pay attention and stop looking at the public. Du Plessis postponed the matter to give the defence more time to gather evidence to support their case. He said defence lawyer Mishack Maluleke needed to convince him that his client was likely to be acquitted. “You must persuade me why he should be granted bail otherwise I’m going to decline,” said Du Plessis. Maluleke said the state did not have enough evidence against the accused. “At this stage, the state is only speculating about the cause of death and not the actual post mortem report,” Maluleke told Daily Sun.
