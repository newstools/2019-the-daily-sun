THE Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) head-quarters were
set alight amidst the Zimbabwe shutdown which was caused by huge petrol price
increases. The building was set alight by over 20 attackers who allegedly
arrived in about 10 cars. Speaking to News24 Africa, MDC's presidential spokesperson
Nkululeko Sibanda said they quickly deactivated the office’s security personnel
as some of them were armed. "They then applied some substance after gaining entry
by breaking into the building. They then set the building ablaze,” Sibanda
said. The three day shutdown is expected to continue, as it enters
day two and violence is expected to continue. The fact the Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa is not in the
country to help deal with the national crisis has added to the protests and he’s
received criticism from opposing parties and analysts. He's embarked on a two-week long visit to 5 different
countries.
