AN 11-year-old boy was killed at the after tears gathering for a murdered gangster. The incident happened in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Mbaza Dlamini of KwaZakhele kasi was killed as he was watching gangsters spinning cars and shooting in the air at the after tears. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “The funeral was for Siyamthanda “Ncuncu” Ndema (28). He was murdered on 7 January at Gqalane’s tavern in Zwide. “His funeral started at 7am at his home in Makhubalo Street in KwaZakhele and ended just before 1.30pm. Many of the mourners returned to Makhubalo Street, where people gathered in the street.” Beetge saidcars were spinning in the tightly packed street. “At about 2.50pm, several gun shots were fired by unknown gunmen and it’s suspected one of the shots hit the 11-year-old boy, who was watching the activities. “He died at the scene,” he said. Motherwell cluster commander Major-General Dawie Rabie said the police were part of the funeral procession to the cemetery and various cars and people were searched. He said no serious incidents took place except for a few minor traffic violations. “A crowd gathered at Makhubalo Street afterwards, where general lawless behaviour took place, which included vehicle spinning and firing of firearms within close range of the crowd. These people did not even run away when the shots were fired. “Unfortunately, Mbaza died in the process,” said Rabie. He expressed his disappointment at community members who attended after tears gatherings for gangsters. “It appears that certain community members hero worship these gangsters and attend the after tears as a final farewell.” Rabie said he has instructed a full probe to be conducted into this funeral practice, as well as a proper investigation into Mbaza’s death.
