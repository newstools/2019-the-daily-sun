THEY were sleeping peacefully inside the shop when they were woken up by a loud bang. Shop owner Tarekegn Abebe (32) was still in shock and didn’t realise the driver of the car that crashed into his shop had run away. Tarekegn’s relief when cops arrived was short-lived. Instead of chasing after the driver, they allegedly pounced on his assistant Zaobe Senamo (28), who was mistaken for the driver of the vehicle. Zaobe was supposed to have been taken to hospital for medical treatment, but instead he was locked up while bleeding. The incident happened at Heidedal in Mangaung last week. “Minutes after the incident, police arrived, and without getting facts correct they moered Zaobe, claiming he was the suspect they were chasing. “I want those cops who did this to my brother to be arrested and pay for what they did.” Resident Dikeledi Khompiri (35) said she was watching a movie on TV when she heard a loud bang. “I peeped through a window. I saw a vehicle had crashed into a shop. Cops were on the scene, but the suspects got away. “We ran to the shop and found cops beating the helper. We told them they were beating the wrong guy.” Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said: “We’ve opened a possession of suspected stolen vehicle case. A suspected illegal immigrant has been arrested.”
