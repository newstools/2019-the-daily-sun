Pretty girl, K Naomi Noinyane has had another mini race day meltdown this weekend. We’re not sure whether she is just insecure about her outfits (but why wear them?) or if these horse-racing events just don’t agree with her. But whatever is going on, she needs to get a handle on it. PICS: K NAOMI’S KENYAN GETAWAY! The 27-year-old model and TV personality has revealed that she wasn’t completely happy with her Sun Met 2019 ensemble. “I wasn’t 100 about my outfit today at the @SunMetZA but it was still a go ahead,” she said. This tweet immediately gave us déjà vu, because in fact, she had a similar meltdown during the 2018 Vodacom Durban July (VDJ). K NAOMI: "I COULD CRY FROM THE PAIN" In fact, she had a meltdown in general during the VDJ. “I wasn’t invited to #VDJ2018 by any brand, but I put my best foot forward regardless. My outfit was made by my tailor, he executed my design not perfectly but good enough to feel great in it. Underrated. But I love looking good Man,” she said. Perhaps it is time our beloved K Naomi takes a page out of Lady Zamar’s book and seek professional styling, don’t you think? K NAOMI: I NEED PEACE
