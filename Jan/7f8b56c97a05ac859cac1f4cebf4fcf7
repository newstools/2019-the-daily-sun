NO ONE would have guessed preacher, motivational speaker and Radio Pulpit presenter Mirriam Mashego cheated death after her ex-husband beat her to a pulp. In her first book, God’s Unfailing Love, she bared all about her two failed marriages. “My first husband beat me up so badly that I was hospitalised for six weeks and everyone thought I was dead,”she said. Her second book, Plead Your Case, was published in 2015. The book is about how God empowers people to live a victorious life. “It also touches on generational curses and soul ties,” said Mirriam. She said she got positive feedback from people who read the book. Her latest book, Leaving and Cleaving, was published in 2017. “God instructs us to leave and cleave when we get married. “But many people are not aware of what it means to leave their parents and rely on their spouse.” When she’s not writing or motivating people, Mirriam hosts a radio show called Reflections. She is also passionate about preaching to prisoners and has worked extensively with the department of correctional services. Mirriam preaches at Boksburg Correctional Services.
