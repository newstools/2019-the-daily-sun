TWO men were killed in two separate incidents in Nelson Mandela Bay on Monday afternoon. Although cops still don’t know the motive, they believed the shootings were related to small businesses. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “The latest incident happened at about 7.40pm on Monday when Nkulukeko Gcakasi (38) was shot in New Brighton. He was driving a white Opel Corsa bakkie and visiting a friend when unknown men approached him and shot him several times.” Beetge said earlier, Bay Black Business Caucus co-ordinator Baba Ningi was shot in Zwide. “Ningi was involved in an argument with an unknown man at a butchery and when he was leaving the place, he was shot several times. Anyone with information should call 0860 10111,” said Beetge.
