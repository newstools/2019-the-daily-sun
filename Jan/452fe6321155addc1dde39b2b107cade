PUPILS escaped with their lives on Friday night after their school hostel caught fire. Part of the hostel accommodating more than 100 pupils caught fire and nine pupils were rushed to hospital. When the SunTeam arrived at Dr Blok Secondary School in Heidedal, Mangaung, the roads were closed as firefighters fought the blaze. Shocked pupils stood outside with their clothes in bags. Some had been rushed to hospital for treatment. Jacob Mannie (37) said he came rushing to the school to see if his niece was okay. “I was relieved when I heard that no one was injured or worse, dead. I hope those who started the fire will be caught,” he said. Free State Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said the fire started at about 8.45pm. Mvambi said: “Dr Blok High School hostel was reported to be on fire. All students were fully accounted for. Out of a total of 135 students, nine were rushed to Pelonomi Hospital and the remaining 126 were at the school. The nine pupils were seen for smoke inhalation and were all discharged.” Health MEC Montseng Tsiu praised the joint efforts of the emergency services workers in response to the fire. “I wish to thank them for their commitment to saving lives at any hour of the day. Had it not been for their commitment to serve, we would have lost lives. “Their timely response ensured that there were no injuries,” she said. Free State police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Lorraine Earle said they didn’t know the cause of the fire at present.
