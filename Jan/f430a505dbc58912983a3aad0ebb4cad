HIS contribution to his community has not gone unnoticed. Last year, the department of sport, recreation, arts and culture awarded Looks Matoto (50) of New Brighton in Port Elizabeth a lifetime achievement award for literature promotion. Looks was born disabled but didn’t allow it to stop him from achieving his dreams. He said he found out about his disability by looking in the mirror. “I used to play with other children, not knowing I had a disability. “One day I walked past a mirror and saw there was something wrong with my legs. I asked my mum why I was not like other children. If I had not passed that mirror, I would not have known I was disabled.” Looks now has a honours degree in disability studies and is involved in scriptwriting and theatre. He told Daily Sun apartheid influenced his involvement in the arts. “I was trying to show how that regime treated black people, so I developed the youth to be the voice of the people. “I played a role in liberating people from apartheid. “I produced many young people in the film industry. “Now I use the same platform to free people living with disabilities from discrimination. “I was trained by the actor Winston Ntshona, who told me living with a disability must not stop me following my dreams.” Looks said disabled people have played a role in developing all aspects of life. “They must not let their disability become a stumbling block or become recipients of hand-outs. “They must stand up and fight for their space and let society know this space is theirs too. “The award means people living with a disability are finally being recognised because we have been sidelined.
