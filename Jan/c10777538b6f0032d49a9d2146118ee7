ELDERLY people are supposed to be looked after with love and care. But these gogos say their lives have become a nightmare as they fear thugs will rape and murder them. This comes after a 71-year-old gogo was found raped and stabbed to death in her room at Helen Joseph Women’s Hostel in Alexandra, north of Joburg, just over a week ago. Gogos living at the hostel told Daily Sun they were bothered by a person who walked around at night checking if their doors were locked. Lebogang Segole (28) said she was traumatised when she saw the body of gogo Josetina Mqebelo, who was originally from Eastern Cape. “It was around 7am on a Sunday morning when I passed her window and it looked like she was sitting down. I did not pay much attention. When I left my room at around 3pm, I saw she was still sitting in the same position. “Her room was full of flies. The police said she had multiple stab wounds and she had been strangled. They found a condom next to her body.” Police spokesman Captain Mohlaume Mamabolo said an inquest docket was opened and no arrests had been made yet.
