MALCOLM X is at it again! He has donated R20 000 to Nosipho Ngubane’s family for a new house. This after he visited the 13-year-old singing sensation from Mpophomeni in Howick, KZN in December last year. Nosipho made headlines when a video of her singing outside her mud home went viral. Social media users were heartbroken by her living conditions. Malcolm X visited the family with leaders from the area and donated R10 000 to help her finish school and possibly study further. Over the weekend, he donated a further R20 000 towards building the family a new home. Malcolm said he felt it was important for him to be part of the project. “I individually wanted to build the family a home after I saw their conditions on social media, but since people had already volunteered, I had to be part of the collective.” He said he didn’t think the house was that bad until he went there himself. “I drove to their home last year to drop off R10 000 for their Christmas groceries and saw that their mud house was worse than I’d seen on social media. “It gets flooded in the rainy season and is cold during winter.” He said all he wanted was for the family to live in a safe environment.
