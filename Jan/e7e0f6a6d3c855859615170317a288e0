JOHANNA Baloyi from Orlando East, Soweto, will soon have a brand new house! After the People’s Paper showed Prophet Paseka Mboro Motsoeneng the 56-year-old’s problems, he stepped in. The prophet, who has vowed to build her a four-roomed house, said: “I’m turning 50 this year, spending 50 weeks dedicating myself to those in need. “People have been laughing at Johanna’s misfortunes, but things will change soon.” Visiting the family on Monday, he said: “I won’t fix the wall but build them a house.” Mboro said their problems were bigger than the wall. “Three siblings live here with their kids in the house and the whole family’s jobless.” Mboro promised to first fix the kitchen and build a house. “This family’s problems will soon be over and those laughing at their misfortune will know the joke’s on them.” He asked neighbours to accomodate the family in the meantime.
