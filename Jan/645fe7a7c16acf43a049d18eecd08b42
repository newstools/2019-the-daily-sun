ATTENDING school seven days a week has finally paid off for Anele Mthethwa (17), Londeka Duma (17) and Fisani Gumede (16) from Sibusisiwe High School in Mbumbulu, south of Durban, KZN. “I’m so excited,” said Anele. “This is the reward to my single mum who sacrificed many things for me to have everything I needed at school,” she said. Anele will be studying Bcom accounting at the University of Pretoria. The friends got distinctions in mathematics, physical science, life science, accounting, geography, English, Zulu and life orientation. Londeka and Fisani were over the moon that their sweat finally paid off. “We were at school from Monday to Sunday,” said Londeka. “We’re glad this day has finally come. Now we’ll be able to study for our dream careers.” Fisani said they couldn’t have done it without their parents and teachers’ support. “We thank them and our families for supporting and understanding us.” She said she and Londeka were going to study Bcom accounting at the University of Cape Town. The other two top achievers – Bhekamaswazi Kubheka (17) and Luyanda Zakwe (16) from Emhlwaneni High School in Ladysmith – said they were grateful to their parents and teachers for their support. Bhekamaswazi got six distinctions, while Luyanda obtained seven. Bhekamaswazi said: “We had morning, afternoon, weekend and holiday classes throughout the year. Our teachers and parents supported us all the way.” Acting principal Nondumiso Sithole said: “Our school is situated in a deep rural area and we don’t have the best resources. When we finally see that our kids have done well we get so excited after all the hard work.”
