Maccabi FC coach Joel Masutha fancies his side to pull off a few upsets in the Nedbank Cup. The Former Chippa United and Black Leopards coach is hoping for a deep run in the competition. They play third-tier outfit The Magic FC in the last 32 and are expected to advance to the last16, but Masutha knows it will not be that simple. The Ke Yona Cup has already produced the usual shock results with PSL teams Maritzburg United, Polokwane City and Free State stars getting booted by teams they were expected to beat. Masutha has urged his team not to take their opponents lightly as they could suffer the same consequences. However, he is hoping other teams make the mistake of underestimating his side, should they progress further. “We are prepared and are ready to get the job done,” he said at a media briefing. “Both teams have players who have played at high level in their ranks but Magic have more to prove.” The former goalkeeper-turned head coach is also looking to use Mzansi's version of the FA Cup to test his squad depth. Maccabi occupy tenth position in the National First Division (NDF) with 22 points from 18 games. Despite his side’s recent improvement, Masutha is not getting carried away and is firmly focused on achieving his mandate. “We need to progress in the competition so I can get more opportunities to see what my team is capable of, the further we progress the better. “It nice to dream but we just need to achieve our mandate which is to avoid relegation, we can dream after but first things first we need to remain in the NFD.” Tuesday's Nedbank Cup Last 32 fixtures Baroka v Jomo Cosmos (Peter Mokaba Stadium, 7.30pm) Maccabi v The Magic FC (Dobsonville Stadium, 7.30)
