TRIBUTES continued to pour in for legendary disco singer Dan Tshanda yesterday. The musician died of heart failure on Saturday after being rushed to Sandton Mediclinic in Joburg. Soul Brothers founder Moses Ngwenya said news of Dan’s death came as a complete surprise to him. “I’m in pain and mourning over the death of a legendary singer who put our music on the world map.” Moses told Dan’s bandmates to stay strong and to continue making music to make him proud. Disco singer Pamela Nkutha said she was sad to hear the news. “This is difficult and hard to accept. I was shocked to hear such sad news.” Pamela said last month Dan called her asking if she wanted to be part of a music festival he was organising in Tshwane in March. Gospel singer Rebecca Malope said she only heard the news yesterday. “I was shocked to learn Dan had died, since the last time I saw him he was a healthy person.” She said she worked with Dan in 1986 as a backing vocalist. “He was a kind person. I once stayed with them in Chiawelo in Soweto. Dan was very creative and managed to create his own unique sounds.” Rebecca sent her condolences to Dan’s family and friends.
