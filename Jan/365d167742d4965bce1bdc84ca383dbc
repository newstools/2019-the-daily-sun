Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango has been named in the CAF Africa's Best Eleven alongside superstars Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah at the CAF Awards in Dakar, on Tuesday. The 33-year-old received the prestigious accolade to be named Africa's best goalkeeper alongside world superstars such as the Liverpool duo of Mane and Salah. Onyango is also the only African based player to make the best eleven.

He was also a key member as Sundowns lifted an unprecedented eight Absa Premiership trophy. It’s the third time in a row Onyango is being named in the Best XI, a clear sign that he is one of the best keepers on the continent.
