 THE days of shipping off patients to neighbouring provinces for specialist medical attention will soon be a thing of the past for the people of Limpopo. That’s because 28 specialists have been hired and more appointments will follow shortly. The health department allocated them yesterday during a ceremony in Polokwane. Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba said applications for specialists’ positions needed to be fast-tracked. “In our department we can’t be allowed to make mistakes because our patients will be taken to the mortuary,” she said. “We need to work together to fix the health system in the province. We are not doing anyone but ourselves a favour because the people who are dying in the health facilities are our family members,” said Ramathuba. University of Limpopo vice-chancellor Professor Mahlo Mokgalong said those who joined them must enjoy working with the department and the university. “We will give you the opportunity to do your research. I’m sure you will succeed and we still have space for your colleagues in the university,” he said.
