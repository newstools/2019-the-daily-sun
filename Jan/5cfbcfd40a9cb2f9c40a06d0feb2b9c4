AN MPUMALANGA woman accused of stabbing her son to death is expected to make her first court appearance today. The 37-year-old will appear in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court near Bushbuckridge. She was bust on Friday in Malubane Trust outside Mkhuhlu. On Tuesday, she apparently had an argument with her 17-year-old son for using his father’s surname when applying for his ID. She accused him of being proud of his father, who hadn’t contributes to his upbringing. The teen was buried this weekend in Calcutta Trust. Sergeant Zanele Sibuyi said they were investigating a case of murder. She said on Tuesday morning, a resident found the teen’s body on the street. “The suspect fled and later told her family she would see them at the funeral.” The girl was on her way to school when her ex-boyfriend allegedly pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her. He then took her to his house and raped her. He is still on the run and anyone with information should call Warrant Officer Ekson Maluka on 082 469 2940, Lieutenant-Colonel Dudu Shabangu on 082 469 2569, or 08600 10111.
