MZANSI has become a hot spot for human trafficking. This according to the National Human Trafficking Resource Line organisation. It said the country was a source, transit and destination country for victims of trafficking. “It has become a prime destination for international trafficking syndicates,” said the organisation on its website. It said the top three recruitment tactics are false job opportunities, coercion in the form of threats or blackmail and recruiters posing as benefactors. “We receive a substantial number of calls from community members reporting suspicious locations or activities.” The organisation said South Africa was a destination country for many reasons including poor border control and an economy which is relatively better than its neighbours. It said since the launch of the resource line in 2016 they have rescued 84 victims while working with cops. The Global Slavery Index has estimated there are 155 000 victims of slavery in South Africa. In September three suspects linked to separate cases of trafficking were arrested in Cape Town after allegedly offering victims non-existent jobs. Police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said: “Police and the department of education are continuously raising awareness about human trafficking.” Suspicious activities can be reported on 0800 222 777.
