MAMELODI Sundowns are quietly going on about their business, climbing up the table in the Absa Premiership. They say games in hands do not guarantee points. But so far the Brazilians are using their catch up games wisely as they keep on collecting the maximum points required for them to close the gap between them and the log leaders Bidvest Wits. It was not easy and they were times when it was nerve wrecking just to watch, but the Brazilians survived a big scare to defeat Highlands Park 2-1 at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa last night. What matters for coach Pitso Mosimane and his boys is that they got the job done. First half goals by Thapelo Morena and Themba Zwane helped the Brazilians to maintain their grip in third place on the log with 31 points from 15 games. Downs have played three games fewer than Wits and if they continue with this rate it’s only a matter of time before they replace Wits at the summit of the log table. It wasn’t for the lack of trying for the Lions of the North though. Lady Luck deserted the home side as they failed to add to the Lidokhuhle Mbata’s goal that brought them back into the game just before half-time. The unlucky Mbata hit the crossbar with Africa’s number one Denis Onyango rotted to the spot on his goal line as the Brazilians escaped with the three points at the end of a thrilling game. The Lions of the North held Downs to a goalless draw at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria in their first round meeting but their luck run out this time. Highlands came into the game with a fresh pair of legs as they didn’t play a league game at the weekend, while Downs were doing Champions League duties against Wydad Casablanca of Morocco. The Brazilians couldn’t bridge the rigid Park defense in the first round, but it took them just 11 minutes find the breakthrough at the packed stadium. Morena showed brilliant composure one-on-one with the goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini to slot in the opening goal.
