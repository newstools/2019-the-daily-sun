WHEN Matshidiso Letsika lost her job as a seasonal worker at a farm seven years ago, she was forced to stand on her own two feet. The 44-year-old from Thethe in Clocolan, Free State, keeps the lights on by growing and selling coriander. The mother of five is known as the Queen of Spice in her kasi. “Life was tough after the farm closed down,” said Matshidiso. “I had to move in with my unemployed husband. “I started planting coriander seeds and it took about a year for them to grow. “At first not many people knew what it was or how it tasted, but my patience paid off. “People fell in love with the herb and the business grew. “I sell bags of seeds for R10 and I make about R500 a month. ‘It’s not a lot of money, but at least my family can eat something before they go to bed and I can pay my children’s school fees. “A lot of people like to season their biltong and braaied meat with coriander, but you can also use it to cook. “What I love about coriander is that it never goes out of season. “I want my business to expand so that I can take better care of my family.”
