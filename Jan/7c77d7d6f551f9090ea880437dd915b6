THOUSANDS of students struggle to find decent accommodation every year and this sometimes leads to them living in places that do not meet safety standards. But, this problem could soon be a thing of the past if radio boss and businessman Thabo Mofele, better known as Tbo Touch, has his way. Known for speaking his mind and always ready to lend a helping hand when the need arises, the former Metro FM presenter has his sights set on providing students in need of places to hide their heads with top class accommodation. Taking to his Twitter account, the star announced that plans are afoot to build accommodation for students. Remembering how he struggled with accommodation while studying and living in New York in the United States, the star said even though he lived in a basement, he always walked into with a mansion in mind. He wrote: “On February 7th I’m opening my 1st ever student village self funded offering students access decent living conditions with uncapped WiFi and necessary stationery. I’m doing this cause I lived in a basement in the Bronx NY. But I walked into class with a mansion in my mind”.
