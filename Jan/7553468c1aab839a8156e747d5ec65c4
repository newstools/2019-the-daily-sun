THE DA in Mpumalanga has promised the people of Dipaleseng Municipality long term jobs if they give it the chance to rule the country. Visiting the area on Monday, Mpumalanga DA leader Jane Sithole said they would ensure residents have access to jobs. She said they were saddened by the high levels of poverty and unemployment but were encouraged that the people are ready for change. “There was very little development and existing infrastructure was left to rot. “Projects that would have created jobs for residents were abandoned, mainly due to corruption,” she said. “We are saddened that many young people have given up on finding employment as their efforts were exploited by employers demanding bribes or sex for employment,” she said. Sithole assured residents they could benefit from job creation initiatives like the party’s Voluntary National Service programme. It provides a year of income and skills development for school leavers, the creation of job centres, growing small business opportunities and the removal of red tape. “Sex for jobs” would stop. Resident Sylvia Nkosi said: “We are hustling to put bread on the table and believe the party can bring the change we want to see.”
