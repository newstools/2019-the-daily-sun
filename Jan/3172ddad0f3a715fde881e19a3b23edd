Actress Mona Skenjana has announced that she will be taking time away from social media to “truly heal.” The former Muvhango star thanked her fans for walking the journey of POW with her, supporting her sessions and watching her videos on Instagram and revealed that she would be taking time away from the platform. Last year, the actress opened up about the death of her second child, explaining that she experienced difficulties during her pregnancy. “The pregnancy was already under so much criticism and I had to find myself defending one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced, which is motherhood," she said at the time. She has now revealed that the pain of losing her child has proven to be one of many layers and she needs time to shut out the noise but social media does not allow her to do that. “It's been an honour to be a part of your joy, but it's time for me to focus on myself and my journey towards healing,” she wrote on Instagram, “I love you all and I hope to see your support flow over to my other work, until we meet again, May the POW be with you all.”
