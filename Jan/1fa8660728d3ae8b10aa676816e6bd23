HUMAN rights lawyer Richard Spoor appeared briefly in the Mbizana Magistrates Court yesterday. He faces charges of inciting public violence, disobeying a lawful command, and assault. Spoor was bust in September at a meeting in Xolobeni called by Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe to resolve ongoing issues with the proposed mining in the area. When Spoor tried to approach the stage where Mantashe and other officials were sitting, he was blocked by police and chaos ensued. The meeting was closed as a result of the chaos. But Spoor is confident the charges will be dropped. He said: “I’m confident that the charges won’t stick. This was all a ploy to stop me from representing my clients and to try and intimidate them.” Regarding the chaos in Xolobeni, Spoor said people had decided that he was a culprit. “I was not there on Wednesday but there was trouble again. The trouble is not against the minister but against people who support mining. They come to Xolobeni to provoke those who are against the mining. Every time he comes there is trouble.” The case was postponed to 28 March for further investigation.
