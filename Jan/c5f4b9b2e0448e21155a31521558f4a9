FED up residents have demanded that the human settlements department investigate why they have not been allocated RDPs. The people of Siyanda, near KwaMashu, north of Durban say they have been living in the area since 1994 but have not benefited from any housing projects. They told Daily Sun they wanted the department to explain why people who moved to the area after them had received RDPs. They claimed about 150 families were overlooked. Resident Sibongile Shangase (67) said different councillors had taken down their names and promised they would be getting houses but they were still waiting. “It’s confusing and it makes us think our houses were given to other people.” Sabelo Mkhwanazi (49) said the matter was made worse by the fact that their shacks were surrounded by smelly water, which might cause a health hazard. Councillor Mamane Xulu said: “I am asking for their patience as I am working in the matter.” KZN Human Settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said: “I can’t access the housing portal to verify whether the person in question had been approved for a house. As for them not getting a house despite having applied prior to new occupants of houses, the problem must be traced back to the allocation process.”
