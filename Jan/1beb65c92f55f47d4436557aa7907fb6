BOTH his parents are alive, but Cheslin James (19) lives like an orphan. Although he had a happy childhood at his aunt’s home in Eersterust, near Mamelodi in Tshwane, he needs an ID. His aunt Marie-Louise Louw has been trying in vain to apply for an ID on his behalf. Marie-Louise said officials at Home Affairs had told her to bring Cheslin’s mum. They don’t know where the mum is. Even when they do see her, she is simply not interested in helping her son. “The boy’s father is in and out of prison. “His mother moves from one place to the other all the time. “I’m the only one who’s willing to help him, but Home Affairs insists on me coming with his mother.” Cheslin said he dropped out of school because he didn’t have an ID. “Today I can’t find work because they want an ID wherever I look for a job,” he told Daily Sun. “I hope she finds it in her heart to come and help me. My life is stuck without an ID. “My peers are working and some are in varsity while I’m always sitting at home doing nothing.” Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane said Cheslin’s aunt should visit social workers for advice on what to do. “There are several things which the department needs to verify, such as citizenship. “And the parents are needed to do that.”
