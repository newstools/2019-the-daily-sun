EVEN when Twitter attacks him, painter Rasta refuses to be discouraged. Rasta, whose real name is Lebani Sirenje, came under fire at the weekend for a painting of President Cyril Ramaphosa at the ANC’s manifesto launch at Moses Madiba Stadium in Durban. The painting soon started doing the rounds on social media, and Twitter users complained it looked nothing like Ramaphosa. However, Rasta said he would not allow negative comments to discourage him. He said he painted people exactly as they were. ) Lerato Masilela wrote on Twitter: “If only we could get a brave South African citizen to steal those brushes we would all be happy people. Such disrespect.”
