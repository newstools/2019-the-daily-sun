ZINTLE Marikeni (26) died in hospital after a short illness and was buried on Saturday. The funeral went well but residents of Sunny South, near East London in the Eastern Cape, are still in shock. Zintle’s corpse was found with body parts missing! On the day after the funeral, stepdad Koki Ramakatsi, accompanied by Zintle’s brother Siphokuhle, visited the grave . . . It had been violated! The wreath, which had been placed inside the grave, was now outside. The body was exhumed on Tuesday. The head, heart, left hand and left foot, breast, and vagina were missing. Her mum Lulama (49) said: “When the corpse arrived in the morning, we checked and the head was there. “But we’re not sure about other parts because we only looked at the face. I want to know where my daughter’s parts are.” She suspected the Integrity Funeral Homes had something to do with it. Integrity’s owner Denzel Fuller said he was shocked that the family suspected his company in this matter. “During the exhumation I was at the grave. I took them to the police station because they didn’t have money to get there. I must contact my lawyers so they can help me,” he said. Colonel Sibongile Soci said a violation of a grave case was under investigation. Anyone with information may contact their nearest police station or Kidds Beach detectives on 043 781 1500.
