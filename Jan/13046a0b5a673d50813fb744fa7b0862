What could be better than having an African musical icon calling you Superman? Honestly, not much. And that is the world that internationally renowned House music producer and DJ, Nkosinathi 'Black Coffee' Maphumulo lives in. Everyone just thinks he is some kind of a superhero. But how can blame them? Not only has he revolutionized House music on a global scale therefore making him the biggest name in House music in the world right now, he is also the highest paid musician on the African continent, he is charitable, he is humble and kind, he has a beautiful family AND he never forgets where he comes from and the people who were there for him before he became "Black Coffee". And that last trait is what iconic Kwaito producer and rapper, Oskido sees and applauds in the DJ. Oskido showed much love and appreciation to Black Coffee when news broke that the DJ had built his mother a beach house. Get that? A BEACH HOUSE Levels! "My heart danced with joy visiting Black Coffee’s mother's beach house he built for her. She is glowing with happiness. From a herdboy growing up in a rural village to being a Superman you’re today. I’m super proud of you Bhuda. May god bless you in abundance," Oskido said to Black Coffee.
