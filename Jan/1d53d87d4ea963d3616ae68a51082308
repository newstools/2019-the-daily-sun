An 11-year-old boy was killed on Sunday after a car hit him when he tried to cross the N1 near Ventersburg in the Free State. Moleleki Thunywa and two of his friends had been swimming at a sewerage hole near the N1. "The trio tried to cross the road after swimming when Thunywa was hit by a white Isuzu van that was driving from the Winburg direction, headed to Kroonstad," Free State police spokesperson Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said in a statement on Monday. Thunywa was certified dead on the scene after the driver alerted police and emergency services officials. Major General Apaphia Modise, the cluster commander of the area under which Ventersburg falls, appealed to parents to be aware of the whereabouts of their children at all times. "It is also important that we teach and remind our children about road safety. With the recent opening of schools, children should be alert and vigilant when crossing the roads," she said. Police are investigating a case of culpable homicide against the driver, who cannot be named yet. The Free State Police Services shared the following road safety tips for children: - know your signals; - before crossing the road, stop, look left, right and left again and cross the road only when it is safe; - pay attention when crossing the road while using cellphones or headphones; - always use pavements; - never cross on bends or where the road curves because this can obscure your vision and you will not see the oncoming car; - always cross where there is a pedestrian crossing; and - avoid crossing on national roads, such as the N1 and N3. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/11-year-old-killed-as-he-tries-to-cross-the-n1-near-ventersburg-20190114
