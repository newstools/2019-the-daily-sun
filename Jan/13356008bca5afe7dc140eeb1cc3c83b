NATIONAL Freedom Party deputy president Sindi Mashinini-Maphumulo said she left the party because it was run by president Zanele Magwaza-Msibi’s spokesman, Canaan Mdletshe. She announced her resignation on Wednesday. Mashinini-Maphumulo said the NFP was more like a spaza shop than a political party. “I asked why Magwaza-Msibi’s son and Mdletshe were attending NEC meetings, and I was told they were the president’s eyes and ears. “I have never heard of a party spokesman and a leader’s son being given such roles, so I resigned,” she said Mdletshe said the party was not aware of Mashinini-Maphumulo’s resignation. When the SunTeam asked Mashinini-Maphumulo why she didn’t inform the party about her resignation, she said she didn’t know who to tell because the party has no national structure. Mdletshe said he attends NEC meetings to assist Magwaza-Msibi. He said he is the only one who is able to communicate easily with her since she suffered a stroke in 2014. Melusi Gumede, Magwaza-Msibi’s son, refused to comment.
