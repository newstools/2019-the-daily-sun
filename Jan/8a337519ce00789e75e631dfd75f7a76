LUCK must have left the city of Hong Kong on Monday
morning when a tourist walking past a hotel was killed by a window that fell
from the sixteenth story. It would appear that the female cleaner responsible for opening
the killer window is also out of luck as cops arrested her on Tuesday. According to Coconuts, at about 10.25am on Monday, the
window, measuring 144cm by 30cm, fell out of its metal frame in the Mira Hong
Kong hotel while it was being cleaned by the unnamed cleaner. It landed on a 25-year-old female tourist who had arrived
in Hong Kong with her boyfriend just that morning. The unlucky woman was knocked unconscious and badly
injured. She was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital but died of
her injuries two hours later. Her boyfriend, who was walking next to her when the
killer window hit, was treated for minor injuries but has since been discharged. Cops have not said what the cleaner will be charged with,
but say investigations are continuing. They are also looking into potential charges against other
parties, such as the hotel and its management.
