ALL he wanted was his salary, but instead he lost a tooth. A video of the incident at a pub in the north of Tshwane has gone viral after it was posted on social media on Tuesday. In the video, the mlungu boss is seen beating up the worker, while a woman mlungu tries to intervene. Men in the background are heard saying it always happens when workers want their salaries. The mlungu boss’ actions have angered many people on social media. When Daily Sun visited the pub on Wednesday, it was closed. Neighbouring workers said it was usual for workers at the pub to be beaten. A security guard said the mlungu seems to be on drugs. “He is a sweetheart, but if he disappears without telling workers where he is going, they know trouble is on its way. When he comes back he tells patrons and workers to line up for fists.” He said this has been happening for a long time. “Once the video went viral and people threatened to beat him up, he closed shop. “We haven’t seen him for a week now. We pray he’s getting help.” On Twitter black people were enraged by the mlungu’s actions. Some asked for his address, while others questioned why the worker did not fight back. @Faith_Shongwe wrote: “Please help find this perpetrator and charge him.” @lemogang said: “We must go drink alcohol for free.” The worker’s and the mlungu’s phones rang unanswered.
