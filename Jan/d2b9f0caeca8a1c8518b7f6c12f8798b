RESIDENTS fear death could strike should their plea for a retaining wall to be built be ignored. The families from KwaMashu P section, north of Durban, are very terrified. Their houses could be destroyed by a wall of sand in front of their kitchen doors. They told Daily Sun six houses were built below the others, and it seems the planning wasn’t done properly. They said on rainy days, the sand gets washed away and floods their houses. Their worst nightmare is that the sewerage pipes in the area leak and make their lives a living hell. Busi Mkhwela (70) said the leaking pipes had damaged her house. “I arrived in this area in 1983 and there was no problem. “The sewerage pipes were covered, but as years went by sand got washed away and the pipes are now visible.” Busi said she built a retaining wall to prevent more damage. “But that wall has also been covered by the sand. My neighbours and I reported this problem to different councillors, but they all ignored us,” she said. Resident Nomkhosi Cele (61) feared the house above would eventually fall down and destroy hers. “This will be resolved once the councillor intervenes. “We can’t move and leave our houses. “If the councillor could bring engineers, they would find a solution,” she said. Councillor Nhlanhla Shezi said he will call the municipality to help.
