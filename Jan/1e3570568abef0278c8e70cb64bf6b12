FORMER SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng held a rally for his new political party on Sunday. The event for the African Content Movement (ACM) was held at Phuthaditjhaba, Free State. Motsoeneng said he was happy to see that people from all over Mzansi supported him. He said although the party was only established last month, it was on everybody’s lips. “Youths are tired of being lied to and given empty promises. Old people have had enough of living without water and electricity because of the failure of the ruling party. Enough is enough,” said Motsoeneng. He said if he became the leader of the country, old people would not pay for electricity or water. “There will also be RDP houses for needy people. Job opportunities for the people is our party’s first priority,” he said. QwaQwa Taxi Association chairman Zweli Mtuse said they fully supported the ACM. He said after 25 years, none of the ruling party’s promises had been put into action. He said they only knew how to steal from the poor. He said the association decided to work with the ACM because they understood the needs of the people. Party member Peter Radebe (39) said he believes there will be no more tears if the ACM wins.
