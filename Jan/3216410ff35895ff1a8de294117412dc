A-Reece has been asked by an International DJ and Radio Sway to be in his radio show called Sway in the Morning. He has proven that talent shines over anything and if you work hard on your dream, anything is possible. The rapper who had a great 2018, he posted on Twitter that this year he will be still rolling up papers and turning down favors where Sway shared the tweet and asked A-Reece to come to the show and shred the microphone. The tweet reads: “twenty nineteen I’ll still be rollin’ up papers and turning down favors.” If he attends to the invitation, he will be joining the list of Mzansi rappers who went to show such as Cassper Nyovest, AKA, Kwesta, Nasty C and the award-winning lyricist Stogie T who recently went and impressed the host.
