TSHWANE Central police are looking for a suspect after a 20-year-old was allegedly raped on Sunday morning in Nellmapius. Captain Colette Weilbach said an unknown man woke the woman. “He wore a balaclava and pointed a firearm at her. He told her to hand him her laptop and cell phone through the window.” She was then told to open the door. “She said he cut her underwear with a knife and raped her.” Police think he could be the man who raped and robbed a woman in the area in November. Weilbach said: “The man is light in complexion and speaks Sepedi.” She said police were investigating and anyone with information could call 082 421 6655, 08600 10111 or SMS 32211.
