A DESPERATE mum has appealed to the matric exam body Umalusi for help. Zoliwe Mtila (46) from Motherwell kasi in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, told Daily Sun she needed a sympathetic person to help her daughter get her matric certificate, as the girl does not have an ID. Zoliwe said her daughter Sivile (18) almost did not write her matric exams at Nbyebo High School because Home Affairs had her registered as a boy. “It took a lot of help from community members and teachers to encourage her to come and write. My daughter is very frustrated as she believes she will not get her matric certificate because she does not have an ID,” said Zoliwe. “Although she was born a girl, Home Affairs says she is a male. “During the exams, she used an affidavit as identification.” Obakeng Babe, Umalusi assistant manager in certification and verification, said the issue with Home Affairs would not be a problem. “The certificate will be issued with the candidate’s date of birth. It will not indicate the gender of the candidate. We also have the details of the candidate as supplied.” Home Affairs said their investigation into the matter would take around six months. Manager for immigration Luyanda Mzalisi said: “Before we issue her identity document, we must investigate why her gender was changed.”
