THE Hawks have arrested another suspect believed to be part
of a car theft syndicate. The suspect was arrested when he was appearing for another
unrelated case at the Brixton Regional Court in Johannesburg on 9 January. Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said the suspect
is believed to be one of the leaders, of a group of thieves that stole six new
Ford Ranger bakkies at a Phalaborwa car dealership in December 2017. Five of the six stolen vehicles were recovered at a Limpopo
river near Beitbridge, before they could be smuggled into Zimbabwe. "Four suspects, Frank Dube (32), Tsununu Ahmad Maphosa
(32), Ndokiseni Mbedzi (45) and Mpho Dzwuguda (27) have since been arrested and
appeared at the Musina Magistrateâ€™s Court, but only Dzwuguda and Mbedzi were
granted R3000 bail each," Maluleke said. The suspect faces charges relating to burglary at business
premises and theft of motor vehicles.
