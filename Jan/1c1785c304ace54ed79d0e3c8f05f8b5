M zansi must keep an eye out for Colani “SooPurB” Nkosi (25). SooPurB from Nhlazatshe, Mpumalanga, started making music at the age of 16. He told SunBuzz his love of music started when he was in high school. Back then he and his friends used to compete during their lunch break. “My friends were big fans of rap music. “We were always making music after school,” he said. SooPurB released a single titled Skelem in June. The rapper said he learnt a lot from the up-and-coming producers he worked with on the song. “They taught me how to be humble and respect my craft. “I felt honoured and blessed because not many musicians get a chance to work with fresh talent like that,” he said. SooPurB’s dream is to collaborate with rappers Kwesta and Sjava, as well as producer Ruff. He believes they have the same taste in music and a common desire to be as authentic as possible. SooPurB told SunBuzz his music represents and embraces kasi culture. He has shared the stage with the likes of Cassper Nyovest, Big Nuz and Zola. “I’m living my dream life, even though I’m not where I want to be.”
