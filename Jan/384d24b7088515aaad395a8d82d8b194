A 53-year-old businessman has been arrested for allegedly raping
an 18-year-old girl during a job interview. According to the investigating officer penetration was confirmed
by a medical practitioner. The girl says she was with her mother in the Tongaat CBD,
when she was approached by an unknown man who offered her a job as a
receptionist. When she came for the interview last week Monday, she
realised that the address given to her was a massage parlour. The man allegedly interviewed her in the presence of another
woman and asked her to return on Wednesday at 08:00 for a second interview. “The victim stated that when she arrived for a second
interview she was asked to return an hour later.” “When she returned she found that the second female was no
longer at the business and the owner himself continued with the interview.” “He then inquired whether she would do massages part time so
that she could be given a permanent job as a receptionist,” RUSA spokesperson
Prem Balram said. Balram said the girl informed Reaction officers that she
refused the job as a masseuse, however the man stated that this was part of the
interview process. He says the teen was then taken into a back room where the
suspect removed his shirt and asked her to massage him. “During the massage the oil container fell to the floor.
According to the victim the suspect then wiped the oil with his hand and began
masturbating in her presence.” He then forcefully removed her jeans and underwear before he
raped her,” Balram said. Balram said when he was done he handed her a tissue and
asked to wipe herself and advised her to wash her own underwear when she gets
home.
