WHEN he got a job as a pit toilet digger, the 44-year-old was overjoyed. But he was horrified when he dug up human bones! John Mathabela makes a living from digging pit toilets because there are no jobs. He told Daily Sun he got the shock of his life on Thursday while digging at the home in Lethabong, Tshwane. He said he couldn’t sleep properly after making the discovery. “I almost collapsed when I found the bones while digging. “I’m still shocked and afraid because I don’t know who they belonged to.” He said he needed a powerful sangoma to cleanse him of the bad luck the discovery left him with. He said he’d often heard about people making such shocking discoveries but never thought it could happen to him. Neighbour Peter Mahlangu (22) said everyone in the area was shocked to see the bones. “We don’t know if there were old graves in the area, or if someone was buried there. “We’ve been living here since 2010,” he said. Community leader Thembi Dzambukeri (34) said they had been living in the area for many years. “We don’t know anything about dead people.” Constable Yeroboam Mbatsane said the incident was reported to the cops. “The bones were taken by the forensic team for testing. We will open an inquest docket,” he said.
