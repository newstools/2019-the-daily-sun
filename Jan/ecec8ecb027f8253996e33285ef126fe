A truck transporting live chickens on the N1 South before
the Atterbury exit shed its load. Motorists were advised to use alternative routes as two
lanes were affected, and the traffic backlog went back to the Stormvoel exit. Tshwane Emergency Services spokesperson Johan Pieterse said
some of the lanes have been opened, but traffic is very slow due to the
motorist spectating on what is happening.
