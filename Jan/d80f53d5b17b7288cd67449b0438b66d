WHEN a strong wind approached, the Mahlangu family from Buffer Zone in Phola, Mpumalanga, didn’t dream their roof would be blown away. Thuli Mahlangu (35) said they don’t know how to pick up the pieces after their roof was blown away on Saturday. “That storm destroyed everything. “Our clothes got wet and our food was destroyed. “The children couldn’t go to school because everything was wet,” she said. “The municipality has given us tents to cover our houses, but we’re too scared to sleep because what we saw that day left us shaking.” Emalahleni mayor Linah Malatjie said several families were affected by the storm. “We arehelping the affected families. If everything goes according to plan, their roofs will be covered by plastic tents or zinc,” she said. Malatjie pleaded with business owners and residents to assist in whatever way they can.
