PUPILS of Skukuza and Tladishe high schools in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga were urged to stay on the right side of the law. The plea was made during the school safety campaign lead by Acornhoek cluster commander Major-General Diana Mashele. The campaign was held in partnership with the department of education and the local community policing forum. Mashele said: “Every year we visit schools around Bushbuckridge and we stress the importance of staying away from criminal activity. “Pupils use drugs and smoke dagga, while other carry dangerous weapons to injure each other, so we want to warn them.” Mashele urged parents to report drug dealers to the police.
