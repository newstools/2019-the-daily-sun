PATRICIA de Lille has declared war on racism and corruption. Speaking in Cape Town yesterday after her new party GOOD’s policy conference, she said they wanted to send a message to all racists. “We have not seen any leader in the past 25 years who has dealt with the issue of race head on. From GOOD’s side, we are going to speak about race every day,” she said. “Race and gender still determine where you can get opportunities in this country and what you can make out of your life. We will send a strong message that we will not allow racists to speak for us.” The veteran politician condemned corruption and said fighting it would be a priority. She said criminals belonged in jail and not parliament. She slammed bailouts that Eskom was getting and called on the government to allow competitors into the market.
