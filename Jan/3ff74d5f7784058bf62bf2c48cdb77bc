THE two cops that were involved in a shooting which resulted
in the death of TUT student Katlego Monareng, reportedly had firearm competency
certificates that had expired. According to EWN, this came to light in the copâ€™s disciplinary
hearing. The two cops were granted bail last year and are expected to appear at
the Soshanguve Court again on 25 January 2019. Monareng was killed in August 2018, during a protest over
the Student Representative Council elections. At that time, the police alleged that they fired warning
shots into the crowd with R5 rifles. They also alleged that nobody was injured, and that police
cars were damaged. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) said
they concluded its investigation and only two technical reports were
outstanding.
