PARENTS thought they did the right thing by buying school clothes for their kids long before the schools open. But planning ahead has hurt them. Residents from Overcome Heights in Capricorn, Strand are stressed after a fire on Monday destroyed their new clothes and stationery for school, which is starting soon. The fire started at about 5.30pm. Parent Ncumisa Sakati (31) told Daily Sun she had bought everything for her son. “I don’t have any more money.” She said the fire started in her neighbour’s shack. “It came from her and she ran away. She is gone and has left the mess for us to sort out.” Nobuhle Lose (38) has been forced to borrow money to replace what she lost in the fire. “How can people be so careless? We bought school uniforms and stationery because we knew we won’t have money after Christmas,” she said. Parents are asking businesses to help them, so their kids won’t miss the first school day. A worried parent said: “We will have to borrow money from mashonisas because we can’t let our kids stay home while others are going to school.” Theo Layne from Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services said they responded to the incident on Monday after 8pm. He said no injuries were reported and the cause of the fire was not yet known.
