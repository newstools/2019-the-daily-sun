One person was killed and several other people injured, after a head on collision on the M4 near Umdloti Beach off-ramp near La Mercy. When paramedics arrived on the scene, they found the driver of a Ford Ranger bakkie to have died in the high impact collision. “Several passengers of a mini bus taxi were also injured and were stabilised on scene by Medics before being transported to hospital,” Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said. It is alleged that the driver of a Jeep Wrangler was travelling in the direction of Umdloti Beach when he overtook a Mercedes Benz mini bus taxi. Balram said his Wrangler collided head with the Ford Ranger that was travelling in the opposite direction. “The SUV then collided into the taxi which left the roadway and climbed several meters up an embankment before it came to a stop. The 54-year-old driver of the Jeep Wrangler sustained moderate injuries and was also transported to hospital by ambulance,” Balram said.
