A 32-year-old man was stabbed to
death by three men, pretending to be interested buyers. This after the man advertised his
motorbike on social media. However, Mokopane cops have
already arrested three suspects - just a day after the brutal murder of Chris
Williams. Police spokesperson Brigadier
Motlafela Mojapelo said Williams was stabbed to death by the three men. He said the three arrived at the
deceased’s home at Kroompark in Mokopane. “When the deceased went outside
to show the alleged buyers the bike, he was instead brutally attacked,” Mojapelo
said. Mojapelo said the man’s wife, who
was in the house got terrified by her husband's frantic screams and rushed
outside. He said that's when she found her
husband lying in a pool of blood and the suspects had already fled from the
scene. Mojapelo said the police and the
medical emergency services were called and responded immediately. Unfortunately
Williams was declared dead. The suspects were arrested at
different locations around Ramokgopa village outside Mankweng in Botlokwa. Mojapelo said a silver grey Isuzu
bakkie belonging to one of the suspect’s father, a cell phone, an Okapi knife,
clothes and an axe. The suspects will soon appear in
the Mokopane Magistrate Court on a charge of murder.
