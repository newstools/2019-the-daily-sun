A new documentary called Public Figure, featuring Bonang Matheba will soon be released around the world. The docie, shot by New York City based production company, Red Button Films, features several social media famous personalities as well as a few generically famous figures including our Queen B, the only African figure on the docie. The docie will give audiences a look inside the lives of influencers and the addictive effects that social media has on has on society. An official release date has not been made public yet, but the file will be screened at the Manchester Film Festival in England on the 9th of March. Our IT girl, Bonang called being involved in the production a “dream”. “It’s a documentary about the pros and cons of social media and the addiction, and how people have either started lives, jobs and new careers on social media, but also the negative impacts that social media has,” she told The Juice. “I think as a first-time executive producer for a movie that you’re doing, you’re starring in it and producing, to just go to a film festival is unreal,” she continued.
