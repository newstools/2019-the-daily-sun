DID you
know that one in 10 South African men will be affected by prostate cancer in
their lifetime? Prostate
cancer is on the rise in Mzansi, particularly amongst young black men. If
detected early, prostate cancer has a 98% survival rate. This falls to 26% if
detected in later stages when symptoms finally start to surface. Few men
experience early-stage prostate cancer symptoms and even fewer talk to their doctors
or go for regular screenings. Early
detection is key and starts with a simple blood test from the age of 40,
especially if you are of African descent or have a family history of prostate
cancer. A Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test can determine your level of PSA
– a protein produced by normal and cancerous prostate cells. PSA levels tend to
rise when there’s a problem with your prostate health, including the
development and growth of prostate cancer. PSA
testing can detect early-stage prostate cancer and spare men with low-risk
prostate cancer from intrusive tests and procedures. Scientists believe that
this simple blood test can prevent up to 70% of potentially painful and
unnecessary biopsies. Ignorance
isn’t bliss, especially when it comes to your health and quality of life. Keep
it simple with one yearly check-up and a closer eye on the following symptoms: - A
frequent need to urinate. - Painful
or burning urination. - A weak
or interrupted flow of urine. - Difficulty
starting or stopping urination. - Difficulty
in getting an erection. - Painful
ejaculation. - Blood
in the urine or semen. - Pain
in the lower back, hips or upper thighs. Getting
tested once a year can make all the difference in the world. Visit Here4You for
