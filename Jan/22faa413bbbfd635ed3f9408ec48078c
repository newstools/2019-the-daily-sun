LUCKY Moalusi (35) is an unlucky man. First his car was stolen from Orlando Police Station in Soweto three days before Christmas. Now he is being taunted by a scammer who claims to have found his ride! Five days after opening a case at Orlando Police Station, Lucky was relieved when he was told his car had been found. “I got a call from a man who identified himself as Constable Molefe from Vryburg Police Station. He said they recovered my car from an armed robbery scene,” he said. Lucky said his hopes were dashed when the officer told him to pay R2 000 to get his car back. “He told me to deposit the money via Shoprite money transfer. I got suspicious. If it was really the police, they’d at least have given a bank account number.” He said Orlando Police Station cops told him it was a scam. What worried Lucky was that the caller knew his personal details. “He knew everything about my case, even the case number. If I was desperate, I would have found the money,” Lucky said. Police spokeswoman Constable Mpho Hangwani said they are aware of people pretending to be officers. She said the police will not ask for money from victims. “When we’ve recovered your property and completed our investigations, we’ll return it to you for free. “People should not pay money. If they get such calls, they should go to the police with the caller’s details,” Hangwani said.
