POLICE Minister Bheki Cele honoured the hard-working men and women in blue on Friday. Accompanied by national commissioner General Kehla Sitole, Cele attended the 6th annual Excellence Awards in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. This event affords the management of the South African Police Service an opportunity to reward members who have performed beyond the call of duty during the 2017/2018 financial year. Brigadier Johan Ndlovu, head of detectives in Gauteng, received a special commissioner’s award. He has bust cash-in-transit robbers, ATM bombers, hijackers and other serious criminals. He has also coached many detectives who have risen through the police ranks. For his commitment to making sure victims of crime get justice, Ndlovu was promoted to the rank of major-general by the national commissioner. He will serve as deputy commissioner for crime detection in Gauteng. Constable Tlala Mokoena of the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit was honoured for busting criminals, including Soweto taxi rapist Gift Mokwena. Mokoena also managed to link Mokwena to 92 other rape cases. He is currently serving a 105-year sentence. Mokoena was promoted from constable to warrant officer, skipping the rank of sergeant. Several other members from Gauteng also received Minister’s and National Commissioner’s awards. Gauteng was named the best province for the implemention of 72-hour activation plans in response to violent crimes. Acting police commissioner in Gauteng Major-General Max Masha congratulated all the nominees, finalists and winners on behalf of the provincial SAPS management.
