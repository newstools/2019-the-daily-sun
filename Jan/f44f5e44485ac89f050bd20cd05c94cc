Highlands Park have signed Polokwane City striker Rodney Ramagalela on a pre-contract. The striker, whose contract expires in June, will join the Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba at the start of next season. Rama G has been frozen out of the team in recent weeks by Rise and Shine after refusing to sign a new contract with the club. Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama had expressed his admiration for Ramagalela who shared the golden boot with Percy Tau last season. Ramagalela has remained positive despite his situation at the club and will be itching to join his new club after running down his current contract.
