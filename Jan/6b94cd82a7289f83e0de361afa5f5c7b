THE wheels of SunPower started turning on Saturday when Johanna Baloyi’s old house in Orlando, Soweto, was demolished. Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng, dressed in an overall, took a hammer and joined in to bring the house down. Mboro promised last week that he would bring in a construction team to help Johanna. And he is not just fixing the wall that fell down during a heavy storm three years ago. He is building her a brand new four-roomed house. Mboro was joined by Jozi FM CEO Mpho Mhlongo, Sanco provincial chairman Chris Madimetja and Joburg regional chairman Thomas Thaga. “We need to continue raising the flag of ubuntu and never hesitate to help each other,” said Mboro. Mboro said it was alarming that some people made a joke of the unemployed family. Johanna expressed gratitude that 2019 brought change into her family’s lives after years of suffering. “I’m happy I will have a decent home and my family won’t have to suffer humiliation any more,” she said. “We thank all the good Samaritans who are helping us during this time.”
