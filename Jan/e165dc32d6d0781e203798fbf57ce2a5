ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa told supporters yesterday he was happy KZN’s matric results were improving. He was speaking in Uvongo on the South Coast. He and provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala were mobilising people to attend the party’s 107-year celebrations at Moses Mabhida on Saturday. “Although we came here to encourage you to attend the ANC’s 107th birthday celebrations, I congratulate the provincial government for continuing to improve matric results,” he said. “This was not only good for the province but for the country as well. I want this upward trend to continue.” The province’s matric results pass rate was 72,9% in 2017 and 76,2% last year. The Lower South Coast region came second as the best performing region. Ramaphosa said the region had also won an award for building the best houses in Mzansi. He and Zikalala first visited Masinenge squatter camp next to the N2, where they inspected a housing project and visited squatter camp residents. Ramaphosa also visited Port Shepstone taxi ranks and the mall, where he handed out pamphlets. Today he will attend a cake-cutting ceremony at Dr JL Dube Stadium, north of Durban.
