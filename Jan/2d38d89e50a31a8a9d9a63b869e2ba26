A LOT of responsibilities rested on the small shoulders of Vutomi Khoza (17). He knew in grade 11 that he needed to study hard to improve his family’s situation. Today he has seven distinctions under his belt. The Khutsalani Senior Secondary School pupil said he did it for his parents. Vutomi, from Kabokweni outside White River in Mpumalanga, said his security guard father and his mum, who does odd jobs, were his pillars of strength. He told Daily Sun passing was not easy. “I started preparing for exams in December 2017 while everyone was out having fun. I dedicated time to my studies until the last day of exams in November,” he said. Vutomi did not allow his family situation to determine his destiny. “I had to make the right choices and surround myself with the right people.” He said he was certain he would do well, but he was surprised when he was counted among the best in the province. “I feel very happy and thank God and my family for giving me hope.” Vutomi will study chemical engineering at Wits University or University of Cape Town. His mum, Gladness Nyalunga (48), said she was happy because she had seen how hard her son worked to achieve the results he got. “I thank God for giving him the dedication to study even though it was not easy,” she said. Mpumalanga had a total of 58 401 candidates registered for the 2018 exams.
