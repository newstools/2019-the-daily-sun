Thobeka Mdiza wants women to stand on their own feet and not rely on men to support them. The 53-year-old from Gugulethu in Cape Town formed an organisation called Lady of the Waters in 2006. It aims to empower women through beadwork. When she started it, Thobeka was working at a bank but she later quit to focus on the organisation. “During that time my brother-in-law died and left behind his wife, who was unemployed, and seven kids.” Thobeka said she had to share the small income she made with her sister. “I knew she and other women had beading skills which they learnt in the rural areas while growing up. “I just gave them the opportunity to use their hands.” After realising many people did beadwork, they started making bags and sewing dresses. Thobeka works with six women who use beads and 10 who sew. She said most of their customers were tourists.
