HOPEFUL students have been standing in long queues outside Durban University of Technology to register. But the university said it would only help those who had applied on time and were offered a place to register. Alan Khan, director of corporate affairs, said the university only has 8 314 places available this year. “We won’t accept any walk-in applications. “Those applicants who didn’t apply for university programmes are advised applications are closed.” Khan said if there are vacant spaces, they will alert students and open another registration period. “Late applications may be considered, but with no guarantee of acceptance.” Khan also urged students to register online or to come in person to the registration points across the university campuses. “The entire 2019 registration timetable with designated venues is available on the website and if they can’t access it, they can ask for information at the campuses,” he said. A hopeful Fikile Zulu (20) from Hlabisa said she passed matric well but didn’t apply. “I’m hoping to study sports management science. I didn’t apply because I wasn’t sure I would pass,” Fikile said.
