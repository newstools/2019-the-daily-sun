THE two men were apparently best friends and did everything together, even dealing in drugs. And on Tuesday, it was found they had died together and been buried next to each other. Police in Troyeville, Joburg, found the two men’s bodies after a neighbour alerted them to a possible murder. A neighbour told cops that two men were brought into the shack by two other men in the early hours of the morning. She claimed they were tortured for at least five hours. The neighbour who alerted the cops became worried when she could no longer hear the men screaming and saw the other two leave. Police spokesman Captain Richard Munyayi said: “The police rushed to the shack where everything was neatly packed. But neighbours insisted they didn’t see the two men leave.” Munyayi said the K9 unit was called. A bed was removed and with the help of sniffer dogs, they started digging. “Two bodies were found. It’s believed they were assaulted with a crowbar before being strangled,” he said. Munyayi said a 30-year-old woman who allegedly helped the suspects clean the shack and took part in the killing was charged with murder. The cops appealed to the public to help find the other two suspects.
