LEBOGANG Shekeshe is a very unhappy mum. She says her 16-year-old daughter Mbali was chased away from school for wearing the wrong uniform. The grade 10 pupil at Masithwalisane Secondary School in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, has been staying home since the incident last week. “The only thing my daughter does is cry, and it saddens me,” said Lebogang. The mum said she blamed a business in the area called Shembe Garments for the drama. “I went to them last month to place an order for my daughter’s uniform. They took measurements and we paid the full amount of R180. We were ready to pick up the uniform the following week, but it was not ready. “I went to check several times and I was told to be patient. The store even promised to deliver the uniform to our home. “The day before school opened, they said they didn’t have enough workers and refunded the money.” Mbali saidshe went to school in a different uniform and a teacher told her to leave the school until she had the right clothing. Lebogang said she went to the school to confront the teacher. “Instead of compromising, she gave me a list of stores that supply their uniform. I went there and they didn’t have my daughter’s size.” Lebogang said the biggest size was 42 but Mbali wore between 46 and 50. “Yes, my daughter is big but I should have been given time to sort out the right size while she continued attending school.Shembe Garments, the school uniform service provider, failed me.” School principal Vusi Moloi said he was not aware of the incident and apologised. “The pupil must come to school until her parents find a uniform,” he said. Thembi Liswe of Shembe Garments said they would give Mbali an uniform for free and pay for her taxi fare to the store.
