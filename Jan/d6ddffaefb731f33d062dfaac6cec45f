THE bodies of four South Africans who drowned in Mozambique have been found and will come home today. Lesego Matsepe, Mmatholo Mogafe, David Kaise and Gregory Mfune left Limpopo last week with four other friends to celebrate a birthday. Last Monday, the four went missing while swimming in the sea at the Portuguese Islands. They were overpowered by a wave and swept into the sea. Three of the bodies were retrieved on Friday and the fourth early on Saturday morning. Two of the dead are from Groblersdal in Limpopo and the other two are from Secunda in Mpumalanga and Bloemfontein, Free State. The four survivors, Vincent Rammupudu, Lesedi Mmotong, Basetsana Mogafe and Lefentse Mampuru are all from Tafelkop, near Groblersdal. They were rescued by the Mozambican authorities and have returned home. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha said he had been in contact with President Cyril Ramaphosa, International Relations Minister Lindiwe Sisulu and Mozambican authorities over the incident. Mathabatha said the families of the dead were shattered. He said he had set up a special team of social workers and psychologists to visit them at their homes on Friday. He also sent Elias Motsoaledi mayor Julia Mathebe to Mozambique to support the families who went there after the incident.
