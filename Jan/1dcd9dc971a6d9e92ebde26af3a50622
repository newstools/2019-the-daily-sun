LITTLE known South African midfielder, Kgaogela Sekgota, has FINALLY completed his move to Portuguese top division side Vitoria Setubal, SunSport can confirm. The 21-year-old has been with Setubal since October last year but had to wait for the transfer window to open to officially complete his move. His work-permit and other paperwork couldn’t be completed at that time and was forced to wait for the international transfer certificate (ITC) to be issued so that he can commit to Setubal. Sekgota was previously on the books of Lithuanian side FC Stumbras where he partnered with compatriot in attacking-midfielder Jaisen Clifford. Together they helped the club from Kaunas win their first ever Lithuanian Cup, in September 2017. The player’s agent Bally Smart confirmed yesterday that he has officially signed “and should be available for the club’s next game on Sunday (against Chaves)”. “When the club signed him in October he was training while also getting paid,” Smart explains. “The only issue was his registration because of the delayed ITC. Remember he signed outside the window period. At this point in time, we just want him to play before agreeing to any contract extension, which has to be by mutual agreement.” Sekgota was born in Mmotong wa Perekisi village outside Seshego, Polokwane in Limpopo. He scored four goals in 36 appearances for Stumbras whom he joined from Polokwane United in March 2017. Setubal is the club that former Orlando Pirates striker Kermit Erasmus has previously played for before he was signed by Cape Town City late last year without kicking a ball.
