Former Bafana Bafana striker Philemon “Chippa” Masinga has died at the age of 49. The South African Football Association (SAFA) confirmed the sad news on social media. Masinga, who was part of the Bafana Bafana team that won the first and only Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in 1996, had been admitted into Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp in December suffering from an undisclosed illness. Mzansi rallied behind the ailing soccer legend as he fought for his life. But on Sunday morning, Masinga lost his long battle with illness. The former Leeds United striker donned the national team jersey 58 times and found the back of the net on 18 occasions during his stunning Bafana Bafana career. One of Masinga’s biggest highlights was scoring the crucial goal to send South Africa to the 1998 Fifa World Cup in France.
