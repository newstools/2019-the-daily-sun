ELDA Mabizela (59) is doing something about the unemployment in her kasi. Elda from Dark City in Nkangala, Mpumalanga, teaches young women in her kasi how to knit and crochet. “After I realised there were many unemployed young women in my kasi, I decided to use my skills to empower them,” said Elda. “Some of the young women I teach graduated from institutions of higher learning but still can’t find jobs. “I’m sharing my skills with 10 young people for the next three months. “Hopefully, they will be able to put food on the table.” Elda said she and her trainees make scarfs, skirts, jerseys, blankets, boots and slippers. She said they hope to donate some of their products to an orphanage and sell some to keep the school going. Elda said she would be grateful if big companies donated wool and knitting needles. Portia Motau (30) said the skills she learnt from Elda will help her open a business that can create jobs. “It’s good that we’re making our own products instead of importing,” said Portia. “This is a great initiative that will propel women to greater heights.”
