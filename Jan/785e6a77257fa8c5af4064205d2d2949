A 26-year-old man was critically injured when he crashed his BMW on the N1 Highway in Century City, in the Western Cape. ER24’s Russel Meiring said it is understood that the car crashed into the centre median, crossed the highway and had come to a stop in the emergency lane. “On assessment, paramedics found that the man had sustained serious injuries to his legs and head, leaving him in a critical condition,” Meiring said. The man was treated for his injuries and provided with several advanced life support interventions. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known. In the video, which was captured by pedestrians on an overhead bridge, the BMW can be seen driving at high speeds. Before the BMW crashed into the centre median, it seemed to be racing against a motorbike.
