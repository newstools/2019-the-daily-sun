GOODNESS Ndabezitha will never forget what her son looked like on Saturday. “His body was covered in red lashes. He couldn’t walk, talk or eat,” said the 36-year-old mum from Mabopane in Tshwane. Goodness said phones went missing in the grade 12 class last Friday at school. Her grade 11 son Donald Ndabezitha (19), was accused of keeping them for someone. “The grade 12 parents found Donald on Saturday morning at a party and beat him up.” She said he was taken to the veld and beaten more. “One was a woman cop on leave who called her friends to beat my son.” Goodness said they questioned him and then dropped him on a dark street. “I got a call about the beating that morning in Joburg and took the first taxi home,” she said. “I almost fainted. They had no right to beat my son without any proof.” She wanted all those involved in the beating bust. Captain Kay Makhubele said a case was opened. “The investigation is continuing.”
