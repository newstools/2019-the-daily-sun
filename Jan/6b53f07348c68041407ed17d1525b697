THE famous Ladysmith Black Mambazo have confirmed that they will be backing Jacob Zuma on his musical journey. Msholozi will be recording his favourite struggle songs this year and award-winning Mambazo is set to support him. The group’s spokesman Xolani Majozi told Daily Sun that they’ve offered their Durban recording studio to Zuma. “The group will be offering its services to Msholozi for free to record his songs,” he said. “We felt it was important to step in and assist. It’s all about preserving the heritage of the country. “We are happy to help.” Thembinkosi Ngcobo, head of recreation and culture at eThekwini Municipality, said since the announcement there have been offers by various artists to join Zuma in the studio as they have always wanted to work with him. “Mambazo, who were always in our plans to work with Zuma, have called to say they wanted to make their contribution for free.” They told us that their studios were available. Zuma’s album is set to be released just before the election. “We need to do this as soon as possible. We are targeting either the first week or the second week of April,” said Ngcobo. “Right now we are going through the technicalities of identifying people who will be the backup singers on the album.” He said this was not Zuma’s project. “This is our project as the municipality. We thank him so much for willing to make a contribution to the richness and preservation of our heritage.”
