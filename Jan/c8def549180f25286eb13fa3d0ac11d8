PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday promised to carry out an ambitious plan to improve the economy. Speaking at the ANC election manifesto launch at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, he said for centuries the majority of South Africans were not included in economic activity. He said black people had their land taken, were not allowed to gain skills and were forced to live far away from economic opportunities. He said the most pressing task was to set the economy on a path of shared growth and provide opportunities for millions of people. “We will open up markets for new emerging companies by ending monopolies and behaviour that stifles competition,” said Ramaphosa. There were fears the president would be booed by Zuma supporters while delivering his speech, but it didn’t happen. However, thousands of people believed to be in the Zuma camp were seen leaving the stadium as Ramaphosa spoke. Zuma got loud cheers from the crowd when he entered the stadium and joined party leaders on stage. Ramaphosa promised that during his first official term, he would focus on the economy of townships and villages. He said the government would work with commercial banks and other financial institutions to find ways to expand funding for businesses in these areas. The president also said there were plans for what he called a skills revolution. “Our education must prepare young people for a workplace that is being rapidly transformed by technological change. Occupations that have existed for decades may not exist tomorrow. Skills that are taught today may have little value in the near future,” he said. He said the government would give young people opportunities to develop new software, applications and devices through start-up programmes. Yesterday, Ramaphosa attended a service at the Methodist Church in central Durban where he thanked the church for its support. He told the congregation the ANC would learn from its mistakes in the past and grow the economy.
