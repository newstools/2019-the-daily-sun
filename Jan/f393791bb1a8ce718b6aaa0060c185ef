DICK and Sarah Sekoma were looking forward to seeing their daughter go to university. But the couple from Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, died in the crash at Mountain View Train Station last Tuesday. The Sekomas were accompanying their daughter to register at university when it happened. Dick died at the scene, while his wife was airlifted to hospital, where she died upon arrival. Their three children, whom they were travelling with, sustained serious injuries. Sarah’s sister Mirenda Bopape (28) said the crash has left the family devastated. She expected to hear her niece was accepted at university when her phone rang. “I will never forget her voice as she told me there was an accident. I couldn’t hear what she was saying but knew it was bad. “That day changed our lives.” She said the three children were still traumatised. Her sister was hoping for a good year. “Her husband had just got a job and her daughter passed matric very well. She was looking forward to having a graduate in the family.” Mirenda said she will now have to look after seven children. She said Metrorail has been helping the family with funeral arrangements and medical bills. Sarah and Dick will be buried on Saturday in Soshanguve. Hlungwane Baloyi survived the crash, but not her husband Samuel. The 50-year-old from Soshanguve was travelling with her husband to apply for his pension in town. She told Daily Sun she was seated next to her husband in the train, but couldn’t see where he was after the crash. “There was blood everywhere and we were scattered all over. I kept asking where my husband was, but no one answered.” Samuel will be buried on Saturday in Soshanguve.
