JOEL “Mporofita” Masutha says the experience he gained while coaching in the Absa Premiership will come in handy at his new job. The former Black Leopards and Chippa United coach joined National First Division side Maccabi FC yesterday on a six-months contract. Masutha replaced former Kaizer Chiefs defender Mokete Tsotetsi, who has been demoted to become his assistant. “I have learnt a lot in the top flight,” said Masutha, who was sacked by Chippa last week after being in charge of only five league games. The Leopards legend, who was in charge of 12 league games at Lidoda Duvha this season has not ruled out his return to the Premier Soccer League. “It is any coach’s goal to be in the PSL and I have tasted that. I believe I will soon return to the top flight to coach there. “All I have to do now is to use the experience I gained in the PSL here at Maccabi.” Masutha said his mandate is to ensure Maccabi stays in the NFD. He wasted no time as he started training his new team yesterday. His team are currently 10th on log with 21 points from 17 league games, and are 13 points behind leaders Stellenbosch. Maccabi travel to the Mother City to face Cape Umoya United in a league clash at Athlone Stadium on Monday (3.30pm). “I am very excited to join Maccabi and I hope we can achieve our goal. I had a good talk with the club management and we understood each other,” he told SunSport. Although the NFD rookies still have a chance to qualify for the promotional play-off, Masutha is not thinking about it. “Our first goal is to ensure that the team is safe from relegation,” added Masutha. “The team is at a good position and I have seen that we have good players. “We still have many games to play and let’s see what will happen. “I understand this league a lot. There are no easy games here, especially in the second round. “But we will fight until the end and see where we finish.”
