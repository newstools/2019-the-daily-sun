The Justice Yvonne Mokgoro inquiry into the fitness of Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to hold office is underway. The inquiry, which is established in terms of Section 12 (6) of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Act, is probing Jiba and Mrwebi’s fitness to hold the office of Deputy National Director of Public Prosecutions and Special Director respectively. The inquiry is led by Justice Mokgoro, assisted by Senior Counsel Kgomotso Moroka and Attorney Thenjiwe Vilakazi. The evidence leading team will be headed by Senior Counsel Nazreen Bawa. In October 2018, President Cyril Ramaphosa suspended the pair, pending the finalisation of the inquiry. Both Jiba and Mrwebi have been invited to make submissions as to why they should not be suspended. The president gave them until 10 August to make their submissions. In the letters of suspension, President Ramaphosa said he had taken into account the serious nature of allegations levelled against Jiba and Mrwebi. “You hold a senior position with influence over a large swathe of the NPA.,” Ramaphosa said. Ramaphosa further said it is the interest of the NPA’s image as a whole that he consider and of the integrity of an enquiry that must result in the clearest and most convincing conclusions about the integrity and sound leadership of the NPA.
