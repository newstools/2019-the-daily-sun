BLUE Security director Brian Jackson has warned motorists to be careful of hijackers who are now abducting victims. Jackson raised the alarm on Monday after the company received reports of five hijackings and two attempted incidents across Durban over the past week. “On average, that is at least one hijacking being reported to our company everyday. This excludes any additional incidents we don’t hear of, which may be reported to other local security firms and directly to the police,” said Jackson. He said what concerned them most about the latest wave of hijackings was the emerging trend of hijackers attempting to kidnap motorists. “In at least two of the recent incidents, hijackers succeeded in abducting their victims. In other two cases, suspects attempted to take the motorists with them, but the victims resisted.” Jackson said a Springfield motorist was hijacked in his driveway on 17 January. “The hijackers abducted him and eventually dropped him off at a shopping centre in Umlazi, beaten up.” He said they believed a contributing factor to the recent increase in hijackings could be the advancement of technology, where a coded or fob key was needed to operate a vehicle, which made the crime easier with jamming devices. Jackson said most of the hijackings occurred in residential driveways or outside a property between 7pm and 9.30pm, while one of the incidents occurred at 7am. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane: “Even though no hijacking cases were reported to us, we have learnt that Blue Security has received a number of complaints.”
