IMPORTANT documents were stolen from Mopani Municipality’s offices on Sunday. The theft at the offices in Giyani, Limpopo, came just eight days after municipal manager Republic Monakedi was allegedly robbed of R5 million. He said he was attacked by armed men in Polokwane, but some people have accused him of money laundering. Municipal spokesman Witness Tiva said: “Some of the files were stolen from the office of the director responsible for engineering and water services. “The documents relating to completed and underway construction projects are kept there.” Tiva said they had learnt of the break-in only yesterday morning when employees reported for duty. “That was when we realised a burglary had taken place and we immediately alerted the police.” Some questioned why it took so long for the burglary to be registered, because the offices have 24-hour security guards. Tiva said an internal investigation had been started to establish circumstances surrounding the burglary. “We are also awaiting a report from the private security company that has been tasked with guarding the building. “We are concerned that these incidents are aimed at derailing the municipality’s service delivery efforts. “We are calling on anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact the police.”
