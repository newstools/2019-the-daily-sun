KIDS should go to school to learn, grow up and to be successful – not beat each other up! Two videos went viral on social media showing pupils beating each other up. One video was taken at Hoërskool President in Ridgeway, Joburg. In the 21-second video taken in the school, a kid punches another until he falls and the alleged beater leaves him there. Other kids come to help the beaten boy to his feet. Social media users called for the bully to be removed from the school. “You can see that’s not a kid. It’s a man. What is he doing at school? He should be working,” wrote Koketso Mchunu. The second video shows a pupil from General Smuts Secondary School in the Vaal, south of Joburg, brutally assaulting a fellow pupil who tries to protect himself. No one intervenes, fearing for their own safety. A women teacher calls for a male teacher, who arrives and restrains the boy. The 20-second video has since sparked outrage from parents with children at the school. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi commented on the video, asking for details of the school. In his Twitter post, Lesufi said: “We’ve suspended the boy. He’s appearing before our disciplinary committee on 31 January. No room for bullies in schools.” The second video is also under investigation by the department. Sello Pitso said on Twitter: “Even the female teacher is afraid of accosting him for fear of being moered. A hooligan in school uniform!” Jabu Zwane said: “In the presence of a teacher! Next victim is the teacher.” Maria Jesus: “He needs serious discipline or must be expelled if this is not a first offence.”
