A LOTTO winner, who’s also a mashonisa, hopes he’ll never have to worry about money again. According to Lotto operator Ithuba, a 56-year-old dad of three came forward to claim his R8,7 million. He arrived at Ithuba’s offices on 28 December with a man he trusted but admitted he had already told his family about his winnings. The unmarried father of three said he lives with his mother, and one of the first things he wanted to do was to build a house for his children. “I’ve lost count of the number of years I’ve been unemployed. “When I stopped working years ago, I used the money I had saved to start a loan business. “Every month I lend people money and they return it with interest. “With this money I’ve been able to take care of my family and send my children to school.” He said at first he didn’t realise he had a winning ticket. “I heard there was a winner from Soweto but didn’t think it could be me. I checked my ticket at the shop and was shocked to learn I had hit the jackpot.” He said he always played the lottery hoping to win a few hundred thousand at best. “Winning millions is a blessing! I’m a regular SportStake 13 player and have won a few thousands from the game,” he said. After receiving financial advice arranged and paid for by Ithuba, he said: “I plan to buy a house, start a business, and invest my winnings so I never have to worry about money.”
