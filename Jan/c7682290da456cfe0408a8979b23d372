BUSHIRI’S church services have not been suspended! This is the comment from the Enlightened Christian Gathering spokesman, Maynard Manyowa. “All the reports that the church has been closed are lies,” he said. Manyowa said Prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his church members had gone on a seven-day prayer and fasting mission to a mountain. He said the calendar for their future services will be announced when they return. He said the prayer and fasting were spiritual matters and had nothing to do with the tragedy that happened at the church in December. According to cops, three people died and many were injured during a stampede as congregants were running away from heavy rain. A case of defeating the ends of justice was opened relating to the removal of the bodies before cops arrived. Bushiri has been in the spotlight recently, with some people calling for his church to be closed. Two weeks after the stampede‚ the City of Tshwane conducted an inspection at the church venue and found it to be non-compliant with safety standards. Pretoria West police spokeswoman Captain Augustinah Selepe confirmed a probe was still under way but sai no arrests had been made.
