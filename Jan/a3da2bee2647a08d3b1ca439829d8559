BASIC Education Minister Angie Motshekga is disappointed some schools registered a zero percent pass rate. Twelve schools recorded a zero percent pass rate for 2018. Some provinces celebrated their achievements, while others licked their wounds. The class of 2018 achieved a 78,2% pass rate, the second highest since 1994. The minister said nine schools got a zero percent pass rate in 2017, and last year there were three more. “We’ll continue working with these schools to ensure they improve their pass rate,” she said. She said the department rented experts and took pupils on study camps shortly before the exams last year. The extra classes programme has proved to be working. More than 700 000 matrics sat for exams in 6 888 schools. More than 400 000 passed while 15% failed.
