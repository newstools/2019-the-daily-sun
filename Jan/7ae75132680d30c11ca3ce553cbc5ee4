Local choreographer and reality TV star, Somizi Mhlongo has become the latest celebrity victim of cellphone hackers. SomGaga, as he is affectionately known, had his phone hacked last week by thugs who tried to scam his contacts of their hard-earned money. His fiancé, Mohale Motaung took to his social media to alert their loved ones to not send money to the number. “Somizi’s number has been hacked. This person is requesting money from people pretending to be Somizi. Please do not respond or give any money. Thanks,” Mohale pleaded. This is just the latest in a long line of celebrities who have fallen victim to scammers who have gained access to their phones and/or social media accounts. Bonang Matheba, Redi Tlhabi, Dineo Ranaka, and Idols SA winner, Karabo Mogane are among those who had their social media accounts hacked in 2018. Meanwhile, stars such as Zahara and Anele Mdoda have had their cellphones hacked with the thugs attempting to extort money from their loved ones. Hey guys. Somizi’s number has been hacked. This person is requesting money from people pretending to be Somizi. Please do not respond or give any money. Thanks.
