Legendary Maskandi musician, Phuzekhemisi Mnyandu will officially be charged with murder for the killing of his former band member, Selby Shezi. Phuzekhemisi allegedly shot Selby in 2018 following an argument between the two musicians. At the time, Selby was rushed to hospital and Phuzekhemisi was charged with attempted murder. Selby later died in hospital on the 27th of December 2018, turning the case into a murder investigation. The SAPS has now confirmed that Phuzekhemisi, who allegedly shot Selby in the stomach, chest and leg, will indeed head to court next month on a murder charge. Speaking to the Sunday World, Police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane confirmed that Phuzekhemisi’s charge would charge to a murder one but he remains out on R3 000 bail. “Phuzekhemisi will face a murder charge since the victim died after he got bail,” he said. The publication also reported that Phuzekhemisi will appear in the Durban magistrate’s court on the 15th of February.
