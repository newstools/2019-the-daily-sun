A WOMAN cop found wandering in the bush at the Heatherly landfill on Wednesday afternoon had allegedly been hijacked and gang-raped. Two women approached the policewoman at the dumpsite near extension 22 Nellmapius, Tshwane and the cop told them four men had hijacked and raped her. Police and a helicopter were called. The area was cordoned off and the woman received medical care. Nonhlanhla Mabuza (30), one of the women who found the officer, said they could see she was in trouble. “She was well-dressed and didn’t look like someone who would come to a landfill. “She was limping. We cried when she told us what happened. “Why didn’t they just take her car and leave her alone?” Resident Mapitsi Matlala (28) said thugs rob people’s homes and hide in the bush around the dump. “Criminals take advantage of the place. A dead man was once found tied up here. “We see suspicious cars and think they are going to dump rubbish, only to see the police coming. “The area should be prioritised by the police as we don’t feel safe. “We can’t live in an area where they find stolen goods all the time.” Police spokesman Colonel Lungile Dlamini told Daily Sun he could not identify victims of sexual violence but later asked for a case number to be provided for him to confirm the case.
