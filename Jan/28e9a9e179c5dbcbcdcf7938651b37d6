HE looked after the young girl as if he was protecting her from boys. But he kept her isolated because he was raping her. The 59-year-old madala raped the 15-year-old girl at their home in Maokeng kasi in Kroonstad, Free State. Apparently, he had been raping her since she was seven. The man said poking the little girl was a way of welcoming her into the family by sharing blood through penetration. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng told Daily Sun nobody in the house noticed someone was raping the girl for all these years. “He was very protective and he prevented her from playing with boys. He kept her close to him all the time,” said Thakeng. “The man was arrested on Saturday after he tried to have sex with the girl, but she refused. “He wanted to beat her and the girl told her mum what he had been doing all these years. The mother contacted the police.” A resident said they suspected something was wrong because the man would not let the girl play or walk outside. “He was very aggressive when he found her with boys on the street and she would run into the house,” said the resident. “I wonder if the girl’s mum wasn’t aware of what was happening to her? “The girl has been raped from a young age and it’s strange that the mum didn’t notice anything.” Thakeng told the People’s Paper: “A case of rape has been opened and the suspect will appear in court soon.”
