LEGENDARY disco singer and producer Dan Tshanda was remembered in his home town of Thohoyandou yesterday. He was born in Matangari Village in Limpopo but grew up in Soweto. Dan, who died of heart failure last week, will be buried in Gauteng. A memorial service for him was held at Thohoyandou Town Hall. Hundreds of fans and artists from the Vhembe Music Forum and government officials gathered at the hall. Forum chairman Roxley Masevhe said as artists, they couldn’t keep quiet when a musical giant fell. “He was our torch-bearer in this industry and one of the few left of his era. He put the Venda language on the map after releasing the album Peacock, with his group Splash,” said Roxley. “He made us proud, producing hits and helping other artists become stars.” Speaking on behalf of the Tshivhase kingdom, Chief Luvhaivhai Tshivhase said Dan’s death was a great loss to his community and the country. “He was a legend in his own right. My appeal is for the community to come up with ways to honour him, like burying him at Hero’s Acre. “We urge all artists to follow in his footsteps and continue where he left off.”
