THE University of Joburg’s online registration portal may be the reason for the long queues at the institution. This despite their no walk-ins policy. Many students outside UJ’s Auckland Park Kingsway campus said they had problems with changing courses online when they could not get the initial courses of their choice. Yesterday people had been queuing since the early hours of the morning. Kamogelo Twala (18) from Tshwane said: “I wanted to change the course, but the system would not change it. “I chose Bcom accounting, but I was rejected because my maths mark was low.” UJ spokesman Herman Esterhuizen said if people wanted to change courses, they should rather call the call centres. He said the call centre handled 20 000 calls, while the late inquiry system dealt with more than 30 000 queries. They demanded students who were rejected due to lack of space be admitted and students who were funded by NFSAS be given meal allowances, laptops and textbooks. The university’s Martin Ramotshela said talks were ongoing between management and student bodies. At a media briefing in Braamfontein, Joburg on Monday it demanded that NSFAS be removed! EFF Student Command president Peter Keetse slammed the registration fee process. He also called for free accommodation. “The free education promise made by the presidency has proven to be nothing more than a historical fallacy.”
