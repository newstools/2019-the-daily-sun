WHEN Sibusiso Mazibuko’s father died last year, he was heartbroken. And when he inherited money, he wanted to erect a tombstone for him. But he never got to do this because heartless thugs got his ATM card last month and spent all his money on booze over two days! Sibusiso said he had more than R50 000 in his account, which he was going to use for the unveiling ceremony. “The trouble started when the ATM machine at a garage in Naledi, Soweto, swallowed my card. “I tried phoning the bank but I couldn’t get hold of them and the branches had already closed,” he said. Sibusiso said when he got home, he started getting SMSes that purchases were being made with his card. By the time he got to the bank, it was already too late. Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said a fraud case was opened.
