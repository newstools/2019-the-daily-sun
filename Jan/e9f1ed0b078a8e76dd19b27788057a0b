IT was a moment of excitement, during the countdown to the new year. But as the clock struck midnight, a man fell to his death from the sixth floor of a building in Hillbrow, Joburg. It is not known whether or not the man, believed to be in his 30s, had an accident. Police spokesman Kay Makhubele said details surrounding the death remained unclear, but an inquest docket was opened. He said unlike previous years, the streets of Hillbrow were calm with most celebrations taking place indoors. There were no scenes of furniture being thrown out of high-rise buildings. Makhubele said two more deaths occurred. A security guard was shot and killed outside a hotel in Hillbrow just before 10pm. Police are investigating a murder case. The 36-year-old man was declared dead at the scene. The hotel is known to Daily Sun. In a separate incident, a man was declared dead after collapsing during a New Year’s Eve concert in Newtown. Makhubele said he collapsed in the crowd, and upon examination it was discovered he had been stabbed. He said: “No arrests have been made but investigations are under way.” Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said they attended to over 100 incidents of assaults. “Most involved friends under the influence of alcohol,” he said. He said they were happy to have not received any reports of injuries related to fireworks and praised residents for being responsible with firecrackers.
