Internet sensation Lasizwe Dambuza, popularly known as Babes Wamaleyvels, is finally getting his own reality show. Lasizwe: Fake It Till You Make It will premiere on 21 January. The 20-year-old, who also featured on MTV’s prank show You Got Got, boasts close to 1,2 million fans on his social media pages. Monde Twala, youth vice-president at Viacom International Media Networks Africa, said: “MTV is passionate about entertaining the youth, and serves as the cultural home of young people. “We are excited to be working with Lasizwe. The multi-talented star has proved to be a pioneer in creating innovative entertainment that appeals to young people.”. Lasizwe told SunBuzz the weekly 30-minute show will offer a glimpse into his life in the spotlight. He will rub shoulders with Mzansi’s top celebrities at some of the best parties in Joburg and share challenging moments as he tries to make his family accept and understand his sexuality. Fans will have full access to his roller- coaster journey in the entertainment industry as he attempts to balance being a modern youth with his traditional Zulu upbringing. “I am tremendously excited to be working with MTV and Viacom Africa for the second time. “The first time I worked with the brand was when I was on You Got Got. “That was the highlight of my career, because that is when MTV gave brand Lasizwe a shot. “I’m grateful to MTV for choosing me and for giving their viewers insight into my personal life. The audience and I will share a lot of laughter, tears and mixed emotions,” said Lasizwe. The main characters in the show include radio personality Ayanda MVP and Lasizwe’s best friend, Ofentse Keswa.
