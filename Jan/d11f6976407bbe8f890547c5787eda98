AN angry mum wants the department of health to take action against a nurse who allegedly harassed and chased her away. The incident allegedly happened at Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela, MPUMALANGA, last Friday. Nosipho Kwinika (20) said she was transferred to the hospital by a local clinic after her four-month-old baby had complications. She told Daily Sun after her baby was admitted, a nurse allegedly told her to leave the hospital as she was not breastfeeding. “I didn’t find it appropriate to leave my child alone just because I don’t breastfeed. “Other mothers who don’t breastfeed were there. I thought the nurse had other reasons for not wanting me there.” Nosipho said the nurse told her she would make her life miserable if she stayed at the hospital. She said she was hurt that her daughter was denied the right to be treated in a public hospital. “She told me she will use her powers to make sure I don’t get the help I needed. “I was worried about my baby’s health, and at the same time had to stress about a nurse who didn’t want to do her job. “She kept harassing me. I felt disrespected and want the hospital to discipline her because I might not be the first or last person to be treated like this.” Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the patient reported the matter to the hospital’s quality assurance department. “The department officially lodged an investigation, which found the allegations are not true. “A policy was read out to the patient, but she became aggressive and broke policy rules. We want to dismiss the allegations against the nurse.”
