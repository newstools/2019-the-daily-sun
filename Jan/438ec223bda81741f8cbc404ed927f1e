PARENTS in Nongoma, north of KZN, were impressed by the improved pass rate at Prince Mpikanina High School and decided to enrol their kids  there. But this has resulted in overcrowding. The school has 1 092 pupils and has a shortage of classrooms, desks and chairs. Principal Vumani Nzuza said he had not reported the school’s difficulties to the department yet. “The only thing that I’ve done is order more desks and chairs which haven’t arrived. But I can see that things are out of control,” he said. Nzuza said he needed the department to provide 12 containers and add 20 teachers. “I was brought here by the department to improve the pass rate. There were fights in this area, which ended up disturbing the school. A lot of pupils dropped out but with the help of teachers we worked hard and things changed,” he said. He said he came to the school in March 2016 and the enrolment was 527 but now it’s 1 092. “The class of 2016 had 7% pass rate. The class of 2017 got 93%. That’s when parents started bringing their children here,” he said. Nzuza said last year they obtained 100% matric pass. “Now more and more parents are sending their children here,” he said. The school is full but Nzuza is afraid of turning pupils away because he fears it might put his life in danger. Resident Welcome Ntombela (26) said the principal worked hard to improve the school’s performance. “We are appealing to the department to add more classrooms and teachers,” he said. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the principal must report the problem to the circuit office.
