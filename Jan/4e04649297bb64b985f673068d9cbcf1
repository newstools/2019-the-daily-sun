A South
African National Defense Force officer arrested for a scam is set to appear in
court on Tuesday. News24
reports that the officer is set to appear in Tshwane after being arrested for a
cash-for-jobs scam on Friday. SANDF
spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi said that he was arrested after an investigation
conducted by the military police and defense intelligence. The officer
allegedly promised jobs to community members in Tshwane where he resides. He was said
to encourage residentsâ€™ children to apply for work, promising job in the
defense force. He
reportedly took undisclosed amounts of money from the residents, and when the
jobs did not materialize, the community took action. They
allegedly reported him and the officer was apprehended. Mgobozi
said that while investigations are continuing, the possibility of other arrests
has not been ruled out. He also
said that the SANDF will not tolerate corruption from any of its members,
regardless of rank.
