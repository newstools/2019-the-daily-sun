A Motherwell father who killed his
daughter’s alleged rapist has been arrested. The 52-year-old man was severely beaten
in De Vos Crescent in Shukushukuma, on Saturday as the community suspected that
he raped the 7-year-old girl. While the 7-year-old girl and her
mother were at the Motherwell Health Centre, the man was taken to the streets
and assaulted to death by a large group of persons. “Police investigators did however, establish that no rape took place and a search for the killers of Fundakubi
ensued,” police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said. Following that the girl’s father handed
himself over to police claiming that he approached Fundakubi at his house and
that he assaulted him in the street. Beetge said he was arrested and
charged for the murder. The Motherwell Cluster Commander,
Major General Dawie Rabie issued a stern warning to the community on
vigilantism and said it will not be tolerated. "An innocent man was killed by
community based on a rumour and did not even wait to verify the truth of it. We are urging our communities to give
information of suspected crimes to the police and not to take the law into
their own hands,” he said. Rabie said they urge community leaders
to play their part in leading and influencing the community not to take the law
into their own hands, but to work closer with the police.
