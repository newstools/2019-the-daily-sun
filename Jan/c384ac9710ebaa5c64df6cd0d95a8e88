SOUTH Africans are holding their breath as they wait for more dirt to be dished out at the state capture commission this week. Names of important politicians are expected to come up as former Bosasa chief operating officer, Angelo Agrizzi, continues testifying to the commission in Joburg. At the top of the list will be former president Jacob Zuma, who was allegedly paid R300 000 a month by Bosasa. According to City Press, among those named are Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, several Correctional Services officials, NPA secretary Jackie Lepinka, NPA deputy director general Nomcebo Jiba and specialised commercial crimes unit head Lawrence Mrwebi. Last week, Agrizzi even had video recordings to back some of his claims about top figures at Bosasa, which is now named African Global Operations. Some of the officials and politicians named have denied the allegations. On Thursday, a video of Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson with R1 million on his desk was shown. According to Agrizzi, the money was for bribes, which were paid in cash and stored in grey bank bags. Agrizzi also named former Correctional Services chief financial officer Patrick Gillingham, who he said received monthly payments from Bosasa. He testified that former SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni showed him and Watson NPA files. He claimed Bosasa had been involved in corruption since 1999. Agrizzi is under witness protection and is heavily guarded when he appears at the commission.
