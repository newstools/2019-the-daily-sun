THIS year is looking good for DJ PH, who’s set to go on a world tour. He has previously toured the United States and Europe, and this year he will be touring Asia and the Middle East, before heading back to the US. Asked why he chose to be a DJ, he said: “I’ve always loved music. I always listened to songs and knew whatever I did in future would involve music. “I learnt everything I could about music and always watched videos to broaden my knowledge about it. “I believe music changes people’s lives and emotions.” He started DJing at house parties while studying marketing and sports management. Music has been putting food on his table for a while. He used the money he got from gigs to pay his tuition and residence fees. He’s working on a project that will be released this year. “I’ve already got a few tracks in the bag, and I know people are going to love the project.” The Metro FM Cruise Control host released a single titled Go Down, featuring Rouge and Manu Worldstar, in November. He was also SABC Live Amp’s resident VJ.
