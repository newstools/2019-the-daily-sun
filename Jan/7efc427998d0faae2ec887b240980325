BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic have reportedly agreed to meet their supporters and listen to their grievances, following the National Supporters’ Club decision to boycott Sunday’s Absa Premiership match. Fans were instructed to stay away from the Absa Premiership clash against Golden Arrows as a form of protest in the way the club is being run by owner Max Tshabalala. As a result, less than 500 fans were in attendance at the Dr Molemela Stadium to watch as Celtic drew 1-1 with Golden Arrows. Kabelo Dlamini scored Siwelele’s opening goal in the first half, while Knox Mutizwa grabbed the equaliser after the break. National Supporters’ Club chairman Mabena Pule revealed that a meeting has been scheduled with Phunya Sele Sele’s top brass at Siwelele Park today. Pule wants the club to address their concerns about the future of the team, which has been up for sale for an extended period of time. “First of all, I want to applaud our supporters for a peaceful protest,” Mabena told KickOff.com. “Even though the exercise proved fruitful, but one cannot say we are impressed. We are disappointed that the situation has to go to this extent. “We are happy now that the management has finally responded. We are having a meeting with them on Tuesday where we will tackle the problems affecting our team.” Pule also praised the players for their performance against Golden Arrows in spite of the boycott, and made it clear fans remain in full support of them. “We wrote a letter to the players to say we sympathise with them,” said Pule. “We want to applaud them for the gallant fight against Arrows on Sunday.”
