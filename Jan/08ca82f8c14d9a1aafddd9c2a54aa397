A list that claims to be the official list of 2019 Grammy Award winners has been doing the rounds on social media over the past 24 hours. The list was leaked on the official Grammy website and instantly wound up on Twitter. The list, which has now been taken down, broke the internet when it was released largely due to the jaw-dropping winners it named. The list “revealed”, in part, that Shallow by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper would win Song of the Year and that I Like It by Cardi B, Bad Bunny & J Balvin would win the Record of the Year gong. Some of the other stunners included: ICYMI: BLACK PANTHER NOMINATED FOR OSCARS! - Album of the Year: H.E.R - Best New Artist: Chloe X Halle - Best Pop Solo: Colors by Beck - Best Pop Duo: The Middle by Zedd - Best Pop Album: Taylor Swift. Well the Recording Academy, an organization of musicians, producers, recording engineers, and other recording professionals, who own the Grammy Awards are not here for this entire mess and have refuted the reliability of the list. “There is no legitimacy to this. Grammy Awards results are not shared, even with Recording Academy staff members, until the day of the Grammy Awards ceremony, when names of the recipients are delivered by Deloitte in sealed envelopes,” a spokesperson of the Recording Academy told Complex magazine in the US. The official Grammy award winners will be revealed at the glittering 61st award ceremony on Sunday, 10 February at 17:00 American time or Monday, 11 February 03:00 South African time.
