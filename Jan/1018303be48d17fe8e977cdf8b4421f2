MORE needs to be done to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies in Mzansi. Speaking during his welcome of the New Year babies, KZN Health MEC, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, said a reduction in teenage pregnancy would save the lives of mothers who die while giving birth or shortly afterwards. “Teenage pregnancy accounts for about 8% to 10% of all deliveries in the country, which is about a million deliveries a year,” said Dhlomo. He said close to 45% of maternal deaths in the country are attributed to teenage mothers. “Young mothers don’t always go to clinics for monthly check-ups,” he said. “They hide the pregnancy. By the time they come to deliver‚ there are complications that cannot be reversed. If we were to reduce teenage pregnancies we would significantly improve the maternal health in the province.” He praised the GJ Crookes Hospital for its programme of community dialogue to heighten awareness about the benefits of abstinence‚ protected sex and the dangers of teenage pregnancy. He said the hospital had not recorded a single maternal death in the past three quarters. Dhlomo warned about the dangers of using traditional medicine to fall pregnant. “When people who are aged 13, 14 or 15 fall pregnant it can have many other consequences. “Some of these girls even drop out of school and never go back. Some of them get infected with HIV and Aids. “There are many benefits in waiting before becoming sexually active,” he said.
