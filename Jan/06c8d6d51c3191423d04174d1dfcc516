WHEN Emily Mthimunye chased four boys out of her yard, little did she know it would mean her ruin. The 47-year-old from Leeuwfontein in Vaalbank, Mpumalanga, said the trouble started when the boys started fighting in her yard on Thursday. She chased them away but the fight took a violent turn on the street when one of the boys was stabbed to death and another was wounded and rushed to hospital. Residents then claimed she knew the culprits and a mob beat Emily and burned down her house, causing damage worth R16 000. She said all this happened in full view of the police. “After the boys stabbed each other, the cops were called to the scene but the residents later accused me of causing the fight. “They said I knew the boys who stabbed the other two. “They came to my house and dragged me to an open field, where they assaulted me with objects. “The cops were there but did not help me. “They said they were scared of the crowd, who were mostly women. “The claimed I took their men because I run a tavern. “A brave man eventually rescued me and took me to the cops, who then locked me in their van!” Emily said she was taken to the police station and later learned her house had been burned down, along with all the stock for her tavern. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cases of assault and arson were opened. He said Emily was rescued from the crowd by cops who were also injured during the chaos. Hlathi said a murder case had been opened against her and the police are still investigating.
