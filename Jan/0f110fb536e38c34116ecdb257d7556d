RECORD companies will soon be fighting over the right to sign former president Jacob Zuma. The golden-voiced Zuma shook Twitter after announcing he was going to record a struggle songs album. He was approached by the eThekwini municipality’s parks, recreation and culture department. Twitter went crazy. Users asked questions about its release and whether he needed video vixens. Others even offered their musical skills. @Killuminous tweeted: “Let me produce a song or two on your debut album, sir @PresJGZuma. Got some struggle bangers for you.” @JstcmllK tweeted: “Mr President, tell us you’ve found the dancers. We’re awaiting your debut album.” @Mwelasibobo tweeted: “Baba when is the release date for the album?” But not all South Africans backed uBaba’s decision to hit the studio. @ikemak75 tweeted: “Zuma must just line up at record studios to have his so-called album recorded, just like any aspiring musician.” “He has not learnt anything from the punitive cost orders from the courts regarding his legal woes.” The DA’s eThekwini councillor Nicole Graham said the proposal has not been adopted by council.
