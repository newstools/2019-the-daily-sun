A video of a speeding driver on a highway has surfaced on
social media. In the video shared by Man's Not Barry Roux, the speeding white Mercedes Benz can be seen making dangerous manoeuvres. After pulling off the dangerous manoeuvre between a white Toyota Corolla and a Yaris, a passenger can be heard screaming “Weeeeeh Jesu” just before the horror crash. The Mercedes Benz driver loses control of the car and crashes into a side barrier. It seems like the driver wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, as immediately after the crash the driver came flying through the driver’s door. It is not clear when and where the incident took place. Warning: the video contains graphic images not for sensitive viewers
