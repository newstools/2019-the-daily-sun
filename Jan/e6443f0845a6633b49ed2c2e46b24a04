ALTHOUGH some firefighters lost their lives on duty during the Bank of Lisbon building fire in Joburg, those who survived it haven’t been forgotten. Yesterday, the city of Joburg honoured these men and women for their bravery at Roodepoort Fire Station. In September, three firefighters died in the blaze at the Bank of Lisbon building housing the Gauteng Health Department. Various crews responded to the fire. Some were trapped in the building and had to be rescued by the emergency medical services rescue team. Mayor Herman Mashaba said the ceremony was meant to recognise the firefighters’ dangerous work and to honour their heroic deeds. Public safety mayoral committee member Michael Sun and acting emergency services fire chief Arthur Mqwa joined Mashaba as he handed out the medals. The families of the dead firefighters also took part in the ceremony. Survivor Moleko Bereng told Daily Sun: “The medal came as a surprise but will encourage us to work tirelessly on duty.” “I dedicate this medal to all those who were with us, from those who helped put out the fires to the whole of Mzansi which prayed for us while we were in hospital.” Mashaba sent condolences to the families of Khathutshelo Muedi, Mduduzi Ndlovu and Simphiwe Moropana. “We would like again to send our heartfelt condolences to their families and the emergency services family,” he said.
