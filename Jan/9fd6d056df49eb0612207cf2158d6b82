COPS have been urged to seek help instead of resorting to violence. Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma gave this advice after a cop, stationed at the Witbank cop shop, killed his wife before turning his gun on himself last Thursday. Sergeant Elvis Sithole shot and killed his wife Busi Mokwana (38) and left her body in her car on a street in Tasbet Park. After the murder, he apparently sent Busi’s uncle an SMS reading: “Lesson that next time there’s a problem in the family you don’t just run to the police station.” Provincial cops spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said Sithole’s colleagues launched a manhunt for him after he sent them SMSes saying he was going to end his life. “He was found at his place. But he shot himself in front of his colleagues,” he said. Police have opened a murder case and an inquest docket.
