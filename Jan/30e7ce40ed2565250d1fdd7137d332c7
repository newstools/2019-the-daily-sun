Yummy mommy, Khabonina Qubeka has given us that all-important first look at her three-month-old baby girl. She did so this past week as the adorable little girl turned three-months-old and wished her many more years to come. “HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME. My very first #Birthday as a Mommy! Feeling so happy, so content so at ease with life ... Gods timing couldn’t have been more perfect,” Khabonina said. PICS: MEET KHABONINA’S BAE! This is the actress, dancer and fitness guru’s first child with her baby daddy whose identity is still a secret.
