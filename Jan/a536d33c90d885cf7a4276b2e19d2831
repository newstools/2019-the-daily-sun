THE suspect who was bust in connection with the death of flying squad member Dwane Kemp made a brief appearance in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Tuesday. He faces charges of murder, attempted murder, business robbery and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition. A cop close to the case told Daily Sun: “The suspect appeared in a different court to shield him from the media as the investigation is at a sensitive stage.” The 24-year-old was arrested by the Hawks at his parents’ home in Algoa Park in Port Elizabeth on Sunday. He was one of five suspects who allegedly attacked a bakery. Four of them were killed while he escaped. Constable Kemp (31) died in hospital last Monday after being shot in the stomach during the armed robbery at Le Bon bakery. His flying squad partner Constable Musa Hans returned fire and killed the four suspects. Kemp was buried on Saturday and at his funeral, Police Minister Bheki Cele declared a war on thugs. Hawks’ spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the case was postponed to Tuesday. “The suspect has committed a serious offence. Due to the sensitivity of the case his identity cannot be revealed.”
