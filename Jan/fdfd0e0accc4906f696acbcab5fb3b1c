THE bodies of four South Africans who drowned off Portuguese Island in Mozambique last week arrived in Limpopo yesterday. The dead are Lesego Matsepe, Mahlogonolo Mmatholo, David Kaise and Gregory Mfune. The group of eight friends had left Limpopo over a week before to celebrate Basetsana Mogafe’s 24th birthday. The survivors –Vincent Rammupudu, Lesedi Mmotong, Basetsana and Lefentse Mampuru – were welcomed back home on Saturday night. Lesedi (24) said they boarded a boat to Portuguese Island beach and four of them decided not to go into the water. “Later we heard that our friends were missing, but we couldn’t go into the water because none of us could swim,” she said. “We thank God the bodies have been found.” Lesedi’s mum Nkweng said they when they heard about the incident, they went to Mozambique with the other families. “We thank God that their bodies are back. We can start with funeral arrangements. We wish all of them could have survived,” she said. Vincent said they went to enjoy themselves. “But then something like this happened,” he said. Social Development MEC Mapula Mokaba-Phukwana, Sekhukhune mayor Stan Ramaila and Julia Thabethe mayor visited the families, including the survivors, at their homes yesterday. Mokaba-Phukwana said they were grateful the bodies were recovered. “Social workers have been sent to the families to give trauma counselling.” Lesego and Mahlogonolo will be buried on Sunday in a joint funeral to be attended by Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha. David will be buried in Mpumalanga and Gregory will be laid to rest in the Free State.
