WALKING here is like playing hopscotch at a sewage farm. Residents from Lower Crossroads in Philippi East, Cape Town said they have been reporting the blocked drain to the city for two weeks but it hasn’t been fixed. Sifiso Msungubali (47) said their kids are sick because of the sewage. “It’s impossible to open windows or doors because of the unbearable smell.” He told the SunTeam: “Maybe after you publish the story the city will help us for but now we are still living in this mess. Daily Sun is our last hope.” Sibongile Matoti (48) said they can’t smell their cooking because of the stink. “We use stones and tyres to walk across the dams of sewage,” she said. Residents said while others enjoyed New Year’s Eve, they couldn’t go outside. “It’s dangerous to walk here at night. “We didn’t take the risk and didn’t enjoy our New Year.” Mayoral committee member for water and waste, Xanthea Limber, said sewer blockages often happen due to misuse of the system. “Recently, rags that were flushed into the system blocked a pump station, causing the overflow,” Limberg said. “Items that cause blockages in the system include building rubble, sand, animal remains and general litter.” She said residents and businesses are reminded that according to by-laws, they may not throw items into a muncipal sewerage system that will interfere with the free flow of sewage.
