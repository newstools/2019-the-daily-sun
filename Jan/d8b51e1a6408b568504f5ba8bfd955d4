PROPHET Shepherd Bushiri is only the leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering. These were the words of Bushiri’s spokesman Maynard Manyowa at a media briefing in Tshwane on Friday about the stampede at Tshwane Events Centre on 28 December, when three people were killed. The church hosts its services at the centre. “It is not Bushiri’s church as it belongs to South Africans. “The directors and resident pastors are South African. “The deaths were not Bushiri’s problem, but a problem the church must deal with.” Manyowa said since the incident, the prophet has been heartbroken and the church saw the disaster as a natural disaster. “We spoke to the families of the dead people and helped police with their investigations without interfering. “We have done internal investigations and improved our security and disaster management.” Mayor Solly Msimanga said emergency services held a site inspection at halls in the centre. “Escape routes are blocked, fire fighting equipment insufficient, there are no emergency lights and no evacuation plan.” He said there were also no proper seating arrangements. “The chairs stacked in the halls shows there are a lot of people during sermons. This is why we’ll issue an order to comply. “If after 30 days the necessarylevels of compliance have not been met, it may result in a prohibition notice, which requires the occupier to cease all activity until compliance is achieved.” Acting community safety mayoral member Sakkie du Plooy met with Sanco to discuss its concerns over the stampede. Additional concerns include the well-being and safety of residents outside the centre. “Municipal Health was told to investigate conditions under which people gather at the entrances with regard to food safety, clean water and ablution facilities.” Tshwane Metro Police have also been asked to look into traffic congestion and provide relief.
