WEARING a military green shirt and sporting cornrows, Pitch Black Afro confidently greeted the media and posed for pictures as if appearing at a concert. He then turned to greet his mother. However, he was not at a concert, but in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday. He didn’t seem to be worried and never hesitated to smile, seemingly without fear that his pictures would be all over newspapers. Pitch Black Afro, whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo, appeared on charges of premeditated murder and defeating the ends of justice. Daily Sun reported that the star was accused of beating his wife Tricia Modisane to death at a BnB in Joburg on New Year’s eve. Speaking to the People’s Paper, his mumsaid she did not know what to make of the situation. “All I can do is leave this in God’s hands. I am as confused as some of Thulani’s friends. The law will take its course. I have no problem with the media doing their job because my son is well-known, but I don’t want my name in the papers.” One of the singer’s friends, Khanyisani Vilakazi, said he was disappointed at the way Pitch Black Afro was handling the situation. “He should have controlled his emotions. I blame him for this. He is a public figure and should be leading by example.” Tricia was buried last Friday and a service held at her home in Meadowlands, Soweto. Magistrate Carlo Labuschagne postponed the matter to Friday. He said the aunt who agreed to accommodate the rapper if he was granted bail had to be interviewed.
