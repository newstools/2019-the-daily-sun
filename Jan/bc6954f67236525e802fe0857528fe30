VKB Knights fast bowler Duanne Olivier has been added to the Proteas squad to play Pakistan in the first two One Day Internationals (ODIs). Olivier took an impressive 24 wickets against Pakistan in the Test Series on his way to winning the Man of the Series Award. The 26 year-old has given Coach Ottis Gibson and the selectors another option going into the 2019 Cricket World Cup scheduled to be hosted by England and Wales from 30 May to 14 July 2019. Dale Steyn and Quinton De Kock have been rested by Crickets South Africa but are expected to return for the final three ODIs against Pakistan. Batsman Aiden Markram, whose omission from the initial squad was a bit of a surprise, has been recalled to the team. While his Test career got off to a blistering start, his ODI career has not matched those standards Markram averages just 25.43 from his 16 ODI’s so far compared to his 45.96 in just 15 Test matches. Gibson and the selectors will have been encouraged by Markram’s return to form in the past few weeks, the 24-year-old hit 78 at Newlands that was followed by an excellent 90 at the Wanderers.
