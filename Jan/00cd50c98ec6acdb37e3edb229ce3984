WHEN businessman Mohammed Abba visited the mosque, he had no idea he would soon be dead. He was shot dead at the Jumuah Mosque in Mayfair, Joburg on Tuesday night and died at the scene. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said Mohammed (40) was walking out of the place of worship to the parking lot when he was attacked by two men. He tried to run away but the thugs chased him and shot him. Dlamini said a bystander was also shot and wounded. “No arrests have been made and the motive for the shooting is unknown. Cases of murder and attempted murder have been opened.” Ebrahim Bham, secretary-general of the Jamiatul Ulama Council of Muslim Theologians, called on the police to find the culprits. “A mosque, just like any other place of worship, is sacred and a sanctuary for everyone. It is a place of retreat, prayer and devotion.”
