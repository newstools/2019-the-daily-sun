A FAMILY from Ga-Mochemi Village near Bochum in Limpopo have been living in fear since their relative was discharged from hospital. Their uncle (34) became mentally unstable in 2005 while he was still at school, and he was discharged from hospital in November. Two weeks after his release, problems with their mentally disturbed relative started again, but worse than before. He apparently smashed all the windows of the family house and broke the furniture, including the bed. A family member said: “Last month he smashed the windows of a car and injured an old man at a wedding in the village. “We don’t know how to protect him because people won’t let him damage their property without reacting. He will be attacked.” She also told Daily Sun they tried to get him back to the hospital after his actions but the doctor would not admit him again. They allegedly were told the patient is well and stable and is just pretending. “We also called an ambulance after he broke the windows in the house. They took him away but released him the same day. We really don’t know what to do anymore.” She said they have moved out of the house and are living with their gogo. Community leader Godfrey Malema said he believed the man had not been taking his medication. “We want medical help so he can be cured and live in peace with us like before,” he said.
