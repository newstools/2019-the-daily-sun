K held a candid Q&A on InstaStory which was so long it last over two days.

But of course, we're here for the bits of tea that were spilled.

We work with the same brand and we are cool with each other,” she said. She told one fan that she is 130% single and another that she is not looking to date anyone at the moment. Several other people asked her, for some strange reason, if she is engaged, which she denied. “Why does everyone think so? I wear a small beautiful ring on my right hand. You’ll definitely not have to ask when I have an engagement ring on my left hand,” she clarified. PICS: K NAOMI’S KENYAN GETAWAY! She also answered many other questions including what her biggest lesson from 2018 was. “I deserve happiness no matter what I go through. How others perceive you or treat you real does not have anything to do with you,” she preached. K said that in 2019 she wants to get a better handle on her life and that right now she is only focused on “money, peace and happiness”.
