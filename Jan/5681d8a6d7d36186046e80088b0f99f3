LEGENDARY radio jazzman Mesh Mapetla only experienced the first 30 minutes of 2019 before he crossed over. The former radio presenter’s family said he died at 12.30am yesterday. He was admitted to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Christmas Eve. The jazz guru’s wife and daughter told Daily Sun they were at peace with his death because it had been hard to watch him suffer. “He was a gentle soul who was always ready to share his knowledge and experience with others,” said his daughter Neo. She said it was strange to think she wouldn’t hear his laughter again. “But I’m grateful that I had a father like him. “He was good to me and we were very close. “The two of us used to go to shows together. “His death has left a huge gap in my family. “But we’re at peace because God gave us a chance to say our final goodbyes.” She said she was still too scared to tell her son Yandisa about his madala’s death. They were very close. Mesh’s wife Thembi was too emotional to talk to the People’s Paper. She said she won’t forget how loving and patient her husband was. Mesh is survived by his wife, daughter, grandson and son Karabo. The former radio host was especially loved by jazz fans. He shot to fame in the 70s and 80s as a presenter at Lesedi FM and Metro FM. His house in Diepkloof, Soweto, is filled with awards he won over the years. Mesh’s family was still discussing funeral arrangements.
