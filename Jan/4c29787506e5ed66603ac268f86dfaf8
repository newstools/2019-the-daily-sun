GOSPEL singer Nzala Mokoena’s highlight last year was being nominated alongside big names. Nzala, best known for her hit Bayede Uyinkosi, had a great year. She was nominated in five categories in the Ingoma Gospel Awards and alongside Sicelo Moya and Bheka Mthethwa in the SABC Crown Gospel Music Awards. “I was excited to hear I had been nominated alongside big names,” she said. “I knew that even if I didn’t win the awards I had won. I was nominated for the biggest gospel awards in Mzansi.” She first started singing at Sunday school and was later in the church choir.  In 2001 she joined the Vaal Sound Chorus and started taking music seriously. Nzala said: “I was used to the church environment, which was closed and private. “But when I joined the Chorus, I experienced something completely different. “It was big and we sang in different places and I loved it.” In 2010 Nzala quit her job as a college lecturer and moved to Northern Cape, where she struggled to find work. That’s when she decided it would be a good idea for her to start making a living from her talent and released a demo. She has since released two albums, For Times Likes These in 2012 and Anointing For Times Like This last year. She told SunBuzz she planned to release a single this year and would release her third album early next year.
