THE DA has said they would be writing to eThekwini Municipality in KZN to demand that the municipality stop funding Jacob Zuma’s music project and direct money to artists in need of support. DA spokeswoman on corruption, Phumzile van Damme, has been visiting art centres in eThekwini and meeting artists to hear suggestions on how the money could be better spent. During Van Damme’s visit to the Bat Arts Development Centre on Monday, finance manager Prince Ntuli said the municipality funded the centre’s Sunday jazz show for 15 years, until last year. “It makes the centre unworkable as we work with up-and-coming artists in visual arts and music,” he said. Van Damme said if the municipality went ahead with the project they would be forced to call for the facilitators to be prosecuted. Municipal head of parks and recreation Thembinkosi Ngcobo accused the DA of being ignorant. “There is no funding agreement on this recording project. Zuma won’t get a cent.” He said the contract with Bat Centre had simply ended. “The contracts end after three years.”
