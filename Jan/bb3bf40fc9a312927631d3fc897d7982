SHE is an actress and entertainer, but is seems Mona Skhonjane enjoys being a mother more than of her other roles. So, it’s no wonder she grabbed an opportunity to celebrate her daughter on social media and let her fans know just how much she adores her child whom she also thanked for “choosing me every single day”. Last year, the actress opened up about the death of her first child, explaining that she experienced difficulties during her pregnancy. “The pregnancy was already under so much criticism and I had to find myself defending one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced, which is motherhood," she said at the time. She added that she was confused when her baby passed away within the first seven days of being born. She said: “When within seven days my baby passes in my arms. I am sitting there going, 'Okay, what is going on?' So we are talking about spirituality and I am thinking, I am like, 'God, where are you? I don't know'. It was too sudden." Although she had questions for God about the heartache she was experiencing, she is now grateful that she has another opportunity to be a mother again. The former Muvhango star gushed about how much she enjoys motherhood. She wrote: “The greatest gift is our children. I am so in love with you my baby and everyday without your little sister is brutal but I will forever be so grateful that God allowed me to have the experience of being your mommy. Thank you for choosing me, every single day I thank you." The greatest gift is our children? I am so in love with you my baby and everyday without your little sister is brutal but I will forever be so grateful that God allowed me to have the experience of being your mommy. Thank you for choosing me, every single day I thank you? #AseAhadi #peloyaka A post shared by  Mona Skenjana (@monaskenjana) on Jan 7, 2019 at 9:46pm PST
