EVERY morning at 1am, residents hear whistling and then singing. This goes on until 6am. But when they checked to find the cause, they were shocked to find nothing! Caleb Motshabi residents in Mangaung are gatvol. They told Daily Sun it was a ghost.They said the whistling and singing started last January, with the ghost singing the hymn Hayo Mathata. Adultia Nieuwoude (45) from Khayelitsha in Mangaung said they can’t sleep. “When this started last year, my husband checked. He never saw anyone but the noise continued. “We realised it wasn’t a real person but could be someone who had died here.” Justice Mokoma (38) thought it was a drunk coming from a tavern. “But I found no one when I went to look. We can’t live like this. We need help so we can sleep in peace,” he said. Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane said the person might have been killed in January. “His family needs to collect his spirit. Maybe he was coming from church and was singing when he met his death. The ghost may not be harmful.”
