THEY want their plates back from the mashonisa! After their nephew (22) stole them to repay his R1 500 debt, there is a game of cat and mouse between him and the old couple, but he always outsmarts them. Madala Sidwell Sihlenge from Diepkloof, Soweto said he has to sleep in the kitchen to stop his nephew, who steals in through the window in the early hours of the morning. His wife Sophie told Daily Sun the dishes her employers gave her go missing each day and only a few are left. “I love those plates. They are those expensive ones used by mlungus in the suburbs.When we asked him why he stole them, he said he was repaying the mashonisa. “Cops went with him to the mashonisa but failed to bring back the plates.” Sidwell said it pained him to sleep in the kitchen. “This boy is so tricky. “I thought I would catch him red-handed, but I keep missing him. “He seems to have a lot of plans.” He said one night, he heard a noise outside, only to find the nephew had already left. “He jumped through the window.” When Daily Sun visited the couple, the nephew jumped a wall to run away. Captain Popi Matlou said the madala and gogo should visit the cop shop and speak to the station commander.
