COPS shot a robbery suspect dead and bust two others in the early hours of yesterday morning in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. They had allegedly robbed two elderly women in Alexandria and fled from the scene in their Isuzu bakkie. The suspect who died later was driving the vehicle when they were cornered by the cops. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge told Daily Sun: “Three suspects broke a window and forced their way into a house on a farm in Alexandria. They tied up two women aged 72 and 76. “The suspects were armed with knives but they didn’t harm the women. “They stole a firearm, cash and some valuables. “They spent about two hours ransacking the house before fleeing in the victims’ bakkie. At about 5.30am they were spotted in Motherwell by flying squad members. “The police pulled them over but the driver sped off and cops gave chase. “They drove to NU11 where they were cornered. The driver jumped out of the vehicle and ran into a yard. “He was shot and died on the spot. Two other suspects, aged 37 and 50, were arrested at the scene.” Beetge said the suspects will appear in the Alexandria Magistrates Court this week on charges of house robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and possession of a firearm.
