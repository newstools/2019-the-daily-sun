Chippa United have confirmed the acquisition of former Kaizer Chiefs winger William Twala on aÂ  until at least the end of the season. Twala joined the Chilli Boys as a free ageng after he was released by Free State Stars in August last year. The forward had been on trial with Chippa last week under the watchful eye of new coach Clinton Larsen. He was assessed along with former Orlando Pirates and Wits attacker Sifiso Myeni. However, it seems that Twala caught the eye while Myeni did not do enough to impress the coach and was not offered a contract with the club. Chippa also confirmed the signings of Gladwin Shitolo, Phetso Maphanga on loan from Orlando Pirates as well as Bangaly Keita and Donashano Malama. Early in January the club released Thabo Nthethe, Miguel Timm, Thami Sangweni, Jabulani Shongwe, Nkosinathi Mthiyane and Zaphaniah Mbokoma.
