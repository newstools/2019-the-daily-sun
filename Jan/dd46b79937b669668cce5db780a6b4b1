NQUBEKO Primary School parents want to know why the education department hasn’t fixed a roof which was damaged more than six months ago. The roof of the school in KwaHlabisa, in northern KZN, was blown away by strong winds in July. School Governing Body chairman Hezekia Mdletshe said parents wanted MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana to come to the school and explain the cause of the delay. Mdletshe said local officials had come to the school, assessed the damage and vowed to come back but never did. “I think we as parents are being undermined here. We don’t understand how it can take government more than six months just to replace few corrugated iron sheets. Parents are concerned about the safety of their kids as they are exposed to the sun in summer and the cold in winter,” said Mdletshe. He said they once heard a department spokesman on the radio say they were many schools they were attending to. One of the parents said they thought the roof would be fixed by the time schools reopened but she was surprised to find nothing had changed. Education spokesman Sicelo Khuzwayo said the department was aware of delays in fixing schools were damaged by storms. He said they were calling on principals to request mobile classrooms from their district offices.
