THOUSANDS of King Sabata Dalindyebo municipal workers will down tools from Wednesday. They are demanding the removal of mayor Dumani Zozo, following allegations last year that R65 million disappeared through corruption. South African Municipal Workers’ Union chairman in the municipality, Lwazi Madyibhi, said: “We had a meeting with management late last year and gave them 14 days to respond to our demands. They should have got back to us by the fourth of last month, but they haven’t acted. “There are casual workers who have been on contract for the past 10 years and we want them employed permanently.” He said they wanted the mayor and acting municipal manager Mbulelo Sigaba removed before they discussed other issues. “They have failed us. The ANC should remove them as we are tired of them. We won’t discuss anything with them right now,” he said. On Tuesday, the ANC Youth League in the municipality said they would join the strike. The Youth League’s Bongani Mlanjeni said they were tired of arrogant people and wanted action to be taken. “We are tired of corruption in our municipality. They eat our service delivery money. It has been five years now and this executive has not made any difference,” he said. The municipality could not be reached for comment as leaders were in a council meeting.
