THE angry mum has vowed her 10-year-old will never see her stepmum again. The mum (36) from Honeydew, Joburg, said after finishing her school tests, her daughter went to visit her dad on 26 November. She said the dad had been asking for months for the girl to visit. “But I was reluctant because I wasn’t sure my daughter would be in safe hands. I should have listened to my feelings.” The woman said when her daughter came back after the holidays, she had bruises. “She told me her stepmum had beaten her,” she said. “I know her father is against corporal punishment, but it happened right under his nose.” He apparently claimed they were disciplining the girl. “She is dark-skinned and for those bruises to show, it must have been a terrible beating,” she said. “I don’t mind if my daughter sees her dad but not near her stepmum.” She has opened a case. “I hope others learn from me. You need to find out about your child’s stepmum. Not all of them are good.” Attempts to get hold of the father failed. Captain Aubrey Moopeloa said cops are investigating.
