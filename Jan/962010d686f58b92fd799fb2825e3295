SIYABONGA Simelane’s family was thrilled when he moved to the city to start a new job. But their excitement turned to sadness when the 23-year-old went missing. Siyabonga, from Vryheid in northern KZN, allegedly went to a party on 11 November with his friends but never returned to his flat. His mum Ntombizethu Simelane (68) said Siyabonga’s friend delivered the bad news. “I was worried and I asked him to keep looking for Siyabonga. “After a few days he called and said he had reported the matter to the police. That was when I realised Siyabonga was really missing,” she said. Ntombizethu said the friend called regularly to tell her where he had been looking for Siyabonga. “But towards the end of November the friend stopped contacting us. When I called him, his phone was off. I don’t know what happened to him. My daughter went to look for him but he was not at his flat. I’m confused.” She said she is worried because the only person who could help find her son has also disappeared. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said anyone with information can contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
