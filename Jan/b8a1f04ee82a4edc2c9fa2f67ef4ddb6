MEET Lethabo Maleke and his fleet of cars! The 14-year-old from Phahameng, Mangaung creates eye-catching toy cars, using scrap from dump sites. Lethabo has built two two-seater cars and a motorbike, naming his collection Vrrr phas. The grade 8 Hodisa Technical School pupil wants to study mechanical engineering. “I have loved cars since I was young,” he told Daily Sun. “I used to create them on paper and build them out of boxes. “I built my own BMW Z4 with wood for the panels, plastic for the windows and wire to hold it all together.” His latest creation, a Ford with FS number plates, has two car seats, bicycle-wheel tyres controlled by brakes, a boot with enough storage space for a small suitcase and a sound system. “The engine almost works,” he said. “My biggest dream is to design a car I will drive myself.” All he needs is scrap metal and parts, a welding machine and a grinder, as well as a small engine and battery to create his dream car. His mum Diatile Maleke (38) said: “My child is very creative. He can do anything with his hands. “I recognised his talent when he was six, so I bought him toy cars and he started creating his designs.” She said after doing his homework, he goes straight to his cars. “His cars are his friends. I only worry about him when he gets frustrated looking for a car part he can’t find.”
