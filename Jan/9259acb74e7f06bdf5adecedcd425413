WHEN villagers heard they would be getting tar roads, they were overjoyed. But their joy turned to disappointment last Sunday when Councillor Thantshi Makgopja announced the project, which was supposed to start this month, had been called off. On Wednesday, villagers from Ga-Chokoe in Moletjie, Limpopo, expressed their anger by blocking the R521 and attacking the councillor’s house! The protesters apparently decided to burn down the house after cops dispersed them from the road by shooting rubber bullets. If the police had not responded quickly, the house would have gone up in flames with the councillor and his family inside. Makgopja told Daily Sun: “When they started throwing stones, we hid inside the house. They attacked me but I’m not the one who makes these decisions.” Polokwane municipal spokesman Matshidiso Mothapo condemned the attack and said councillors had no influence on when projects started and ended. He advised residents to approach the municipality for information.
