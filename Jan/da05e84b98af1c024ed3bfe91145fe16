A BABY found at a dumpsite has been in a place of safety for two weeks. Cops took the tiny boy there after a man found him in Embo, Durban on 29 December. Manqoba Wanda (27) from Botha’s Hill, who found the baby, said he is worried because the parents haven’t been found. He said when he found the baby, he hoped he would be reunited with the parents . “I was on my way home when I heard a baby crying.” He then saw a blue and white blanket which he opened and saw a baby wearing a white babygrow. “I didn’t know what to do and went to call other residents. “We called the cops,” he said. The cops took the baby. “There was no card or anything to help us find out where he was from, or his name. “Whoever dumped him didn’t want to be found and maybe wanted him to die, but I found him alive.” He said all children deserve a family. Captain Nqobile Gwala said Pinetown police are appealing for help to find the baby’s parents. They took him to hospital and he was found to be in good health. Anyone with information should call Officer Sihle Ntuli on 079 502 9113 or 031 325 5001.”
