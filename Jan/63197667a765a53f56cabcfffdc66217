THE newly launched Menzi Primary School equipment that was
stolen, has been found in a shop at corner Mooi and Helen Joseph Street in
Johannesburg. Over 185 tablets that the pupils use were stolen, eight
teachersâ€™ laptops, two data projectors, three desk top computers, a plasma TV
and petty cash of about R500 were also stolen. The multi-million rand school was recently handed over to
the community of Tsakane for the first day of school last week Wednesday. Two patrollers were allegedly tied up and locked in one of
the store-rooms. A case was opened at Tsakane Police Station.
