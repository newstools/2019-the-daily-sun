THEY call themselves archbishops and they have their church services at taverns. On Sunday, archbishops Simon Matloga and Ronald Mokhudu amused the people of Seshego zone 1, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, by holding a church service at Samma’s Tavern. The men were smoking, drinking and carrying Bibles while holding a church service for boozers. Matloga preached in Pedi and Mokhudu translated into Zulu. In his sermon, Matloga let the drinkers know that God is there for them when they are troubled. Some of the drinkers even knelt down to pray. “Normal churches judge us because we’re drunkards,” said one man, while praying. “Please increase our days of living so we can continue drinking while worshipping.” They said they went to different taverns praying for drinkers to repent and had been doing so since September. About 30 residents attended. Bob Makhongela (53) said he attended the service to worship without judgement. “We drink, smoke and listen to the word of God,” he said. Passerby Sylvia Seleka (40) said it was good that the worshippers prayed while drinking instead, of fighting. Tavern owner Quiden Mathebula said the men of God brought entertainment and customers.
