THE Vhembe
District in Limpopo has been hit by the Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) after
positive laboratory results. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF spokesperson Khaya
Nkwanyana said samples were collected during a disease investigation, after
reports of cattle with lameness were received. The positive location is just outside the FMD Control Zone in the Free Zone
without vaccination. Nkwanyana said a team of experts from the department and the Limpopo Veterinary
Services is on the ground conducting further investigations to verify the
results and determine the extent of the outbreak. The control measures will be determined by the findings of this investigation. "The matter has been reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE) on Monday.  As a
result of this development, the official OIE recognised FMD-free status of South
Africa is temporarily suspended.  He said FMD is a severe, highly contagious viral disease which affects
livestock with significant economic impact. The disease affects cattle, pigs (domestic and wild), sheep, goats, and other
cloven hoofed animals. He also said the disease does not affect human beings. "The affected area is under quarantine and no movement of animals and
animal products are allowed.  Farmers
further away from the outbreak are cautioned to observe bio-security measures â€“
not to allow any new animals into their herds, and to minimise the movement of
their own herds to other farms," he said.
