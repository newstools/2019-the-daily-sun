The 2019 edition of the Sun Met has come and gone. We saw the pictures and the videos, we all had our opinion of the fashion and for most people, we all envied our favourite personalities living their best lives in Cape Town with a glass of GH Mumm in hand through social media. All that is left now is for us to marvel over our favourite looks of “Africa’s richest race day” or to “lmao” over the worst looks of the day. This year’s theme was Precious Metals, prompting our stars to step out in Africa’s most precious stones or glittering runway looks adorned with gold, copper and platinum. But unfortunately, very few stuck to theme and even fewer people’s looks were even worth this article. Here are the most hideous looks of the day: “...you owe it to yourself to become everything you’ve ever dreamed of being.” ♥? A post shared by  K Naomi Noinyane ????

I may not know much about riches but I do know about dreams and this feels special- I pray for a day when many more of us will be able to come here as participants in the trade but for now I am happy just to say God I see you! I feel you! I thank my dear friends at Boschendal for making the day more beautiful with my choice of Brut as well as all the other fabulous quaffables! It is always magnificent to be surrounded by family and friends on this day, this year being no different with everyone from near and far. Chef Tar we love you! I also thank the fabulous @first_diamonds for my bling... feeling blessed #Bouweracing A post shared by  Carol Bouwer (@bouwercarol) on Jan 26, 2019 at 7:39am PST  A lil’ something from @csquaredsa #sunmet ?? @capturecrew_ A post shared by  Lunga Shabalala ??
