MLUNGISI Jim (51) from Lower Crossroads in Philippi East, Cape Town, is grateful for boozers because they fill his recycling bag. He said it usually takes weeks for the bag to get full, but only two weeks during the festive season. Mlungisi started collecting bottles three years ago. “Some people look down on recycling. They forget that it helps a lot of people. “No one would give me the money I’ll get after I sell these bottles,” he said. He said residents throw their empty bottles in his bag. “I hear them throwing their bottles in my bag at night and I’m thankful for that,” he said. Resident Nombuliso Nkwali (47) said she likes what Mlungisi is doing and hopes to go into the same business. “At first I laughed at him when I saw him looking for bottles. “But after he told me how much he was making, I was tempted to follow his example. “I will be joining him soon,” said Nombuliso.
