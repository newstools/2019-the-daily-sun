THE ANC will not be asking its members implicated at the state capture commission to step down. “Allegations are allegations,” said secretary-general Ace Magashule. He was accompanied by Zizi Kodwa, Lindiwe Zulu, Siyabonga Cwele and Dakota Legoete at Luthuli House in Joburg yesterday. “We can’t be asking people to step aside because of being named at the commission. Let’s use the principle of innocent until proven guilty.” Zulu said what was said at the commission will have a negative impact on the party but will also give them a chance to reflect and improve themselves. Kodwa said you can’t assume people are guilty on the basis of the evidence of one person’s testimony that had not been confirmed. “Only the judge can make recommendations.” He said the ANC can’t suspend or ask people to step down. “If there is evidence against the ANC, we’ll go to the commission and give our report of what has happened in the past 25 years. “We have no fear,” Kodwa said. Magashule said the ANC maintains its position that it will not comment on the work of the Zondo commission after allegations against Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane. He said the list of ANC members won’t be decided by commissions. Magashule said the party will remind voters about the injustices of the past.
