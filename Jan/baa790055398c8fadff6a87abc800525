Former President Jacob Zuma’s son Edward Zuma has set his sights on American celebrities like Oprah. He has slammed them for “supporting Cyril Ramaphosa and not the ANC”! According to Sowetan Live, Edward Zuma has written an open letter which has been reportedly circulating on WhatsApp. In the letter, he allegedly criticizes the celebrities for what he calls support for President Cyril Ramaphosa at the Global Citizen Concert. “The ANC never operates on the wishes of individual leaders, but on the resolutions of its conferences and constitutional structures,” he was quoted as saying. Zuma dismissed the Global Concert, which took place last year in December in Johannesburg, as a vehicle to raise funds for Ramaphosa. “It was clear in the Global Citizen Concert that Oprah and the celebrities who were there were only endorsing CR and not the ANC. The New Dawn Political Party was being launched and endorsed at the back of ANC history and sentiments,” he said.
