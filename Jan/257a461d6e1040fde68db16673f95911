ALL police have to go on are the three names tattooed on the dead woman’s back. Police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said the headless, limbless body of an unidentified woman was discovered by a 13-year-old boy along the railway lines between Etwatwa extension 7 and Albertina, Ekurhuleni. The body was discovered on 30 December. “The boy was looking for his dogs when he discovered a human hand under the bridge and called the police,” said Ramothakhi. Ramothakhi said police discovered that the body was cut into pieces, covered with a blanket and already decomposing. “At the moment we don’t know her age or how long the body was under the bridge,” he said. “The only information we have are the names that she had tattooed on her back, namely: Precious, Nathi and Luvuyo.” Ramothakhi said they hope this will help police find her relatives. He said in October the body of a 10-year-old girl was also found without legs. A murder case was opened and police are still looking for the girls’ killers. Ramothakhi encouraged members of the community to help the police find the murderers. “Whoever is behind these brutal killings needs to be brought to justice. We will keep working overtime to find the perpetrators,” he said. Etwatwa Police Station appealed to members of the public to help them identify the body. “If anyone has any information, please come to the police station as soon as you can.”
