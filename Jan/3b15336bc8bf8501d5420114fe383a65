Local singer and TV personality, Unathi Nkayi and the world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt held a little dancefloor face floor in Joburg recently. In a video posted by Unathi, the two stars are seen in a Joburg nightclub at what was a Sun Met pre-party. Unathi was a guest of both Bolt and Minnie Dlamini (as they are ambassadors of the Met’s headline sponsors, GH Mumm) and she thanked them on Instagram. “Firstly I was NEVER ready for last night Minnie Dlamini. Thank you to you and your fellow ambassador Usain Bolt for hosting me,” she said. In the video, Unathi and Bolt gyrate all the way to the floor and according to the singer, Bolt is the one who challenged her to the dance off. “The FASTEST man on earth challenged me to a get down dance off. At first I tried HUMBLY to decline. He insisted. As you can see I WON,” she said. The video is of very poor quality but you can clearly see Unathi and Bolt getting down and it is quite clear who won. Firstly Sis I was NEVER ready for last night @minniedlamini Thank you to you and your fellow @ghmumm_sa Ambassador @usainbolt for hosting me??Mzantsi then the FASTEST man on earth challenges me to a get down dance off. At first I tried HUMBLY to decline saying ‘Bruv as much as I could never challenge you to a 100m sprint I don’t think you want to challenge an African child to a dance challenge. Our squat game is for the gods of WAKANDA.’ He insisted????‍??As you can see I WON????‍????You’re both gracious and wonderfully naughty. Enjoy CT fam as they get ready for this perfect duo! #WhenFamIsFam A post shared by  Unathi.Africa (@unathi.co) on Jan 25, 2019 at 4:35am PST
