THE memorial service for a murdered policeman was held in a fully packed hall yesterday. Constable Vuyani March (27) was killed in Koffiefontein, Free State, last week when he attended a shooting scene at a local farm. Speaking at the service, Police Minister Bheki Cele reminded cops they should use deadly force when their lives are in danger. “There is always conflict between good and bad. The good must always prevail. The cop does not knock off, he works beyond the call of duty. Cops are national assets and belong to the nation, so behave as such. From here, you must walk tall. The law says if your life is in danger, use deadly force.” Koffiefontein cop shop commander Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Ntoi said it was the second police killing in the area. “Minister, this happened two years ago. Two members were shot and killed in the cop shop and the suspect vanished.” He said he saw Constable March as his own son. Leah Motlatsi from the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union said cops deserved to be respected. Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe said: “The year 1991 was accepted and the day was prepared for. That’s when the March family welcomed their bundle of joy. “On 17 January, their blessing was withdrawn. March always continued to sharpen his axe and attended various courses. We send our deepest condolences to his family.’ There will be an official funeral in Koffiefontein tomorrow for the young cop.
