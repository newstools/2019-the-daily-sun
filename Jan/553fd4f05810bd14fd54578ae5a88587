GAUTENG Premier David Makhura  visited schools in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane. He was accompanied by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. The visits form part of the province’s schools readiness programme. Makhura visited Lesedi-Potlana, Mmabana and Seetsa-Sa-Kgwedi primary schools in memory of the five pupils who were tragically killed when a mast light fell on them. He said he wanted to pilot new ideas at the schools in the next three years. Lesufi told pupils they planned to make big changes at the schools. “We are going to build a cricket field at one school, a rugby field at another, and a soccer field and netball courts at the third school,” he said. Seetsa-Sa-Kgwedi Primary School pupil Lethabo Molepo (9) said she was excited to meet the premier and promised that her school would work hard to make Makhura proud.
