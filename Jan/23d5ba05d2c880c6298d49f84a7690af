RESIDENTS of Marikana squatter camp are still in shock after illegal connections killed a woman on Thursday. Mandisi Cakatha (57), who lives in the kasi in Cape Town, told Daily Sun the woman was sitting outside her shack when she was electrocuted by dangerous live wires. “We don’t have electricity so are forced to make illegal connections. It’s bad because this woman lost her life,” he said. He said the woman had just come home from church when she was killed. “I saw her coming from church and it was clear she decided to relax outside, not knowing death would come and take her,” he said. Mandisi said residents were afraid to go near the body. “We were afraid we would also be killed because illegal connections are so strong and dangerous. We use izinyoka because we have no other choice.” Community leader Xolani Thukwayo said if they had electricity the incident would not have happened. “We’ve been asking for electricity, but no one is willing to listen to us. Look what has happened now.” Xolani said residents would not be voting until the area got power. “We’ll vote for the people who’ll give us what we want. Until then, we won’t be voting for anyone,” he said. Xolani said people decided to make illegal connections because they were tired of living in the dark. “Politicians must think twice before coming to Marikana for votes, because we won’t take part until electricity is installed,” he said. Philippi East police spokesman Captain Bheki Xulu said an inquest docket was opened for investigation.
