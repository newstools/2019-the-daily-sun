KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube has blamed a drop in matric results in eThekwini on selfish teachers. Speaking at the municipal matric awards on Friday, the MEC said the continued drop in results in the region was as a result of teachers putting their own interests ahead of those of pupils. She said teachers spent most of their time last year fighting for positions instead of teaching kids. The Umlazi area saw its matric pass rate drop from 78% to 76% last year. This has been blamed on disruptions at schools. The MEC said: “Before I congratulate pupils and schools that did well in the eThekwini region, I wish to express my disappointment at the dropping pass rate. I’m worried because schools in eThekwini have lots of resources, so we never expected this pass rate. “We have been beaten by rural regions such as Amajuba. This is where you have kids who have never seen a computer or science lab.” Dube-Ncube said she had spoken to Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana, who promised to make eThekwini schools a priority. At the event attended by eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and her deputy Fawzia Peer, Nedbank donated R150 000 for bursaries to 57 schools.
