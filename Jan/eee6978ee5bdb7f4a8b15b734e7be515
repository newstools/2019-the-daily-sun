THEY have started dumping uncollected rubbish outside the municipal offices. Gatvol residents of Umlazi, south of Durban, complained that rubbish was piling up in their yards since rubbish collectors went on strike on Friday. The workers vowed not to return to work until they’d been paid. Residents who live close to the offices in V section said they started dumping rubbish on Tuesday afternoon. Mduduzi Ngubane (40) from E section said he removed rubbish from his yard in his bakkie after he saw his five-year-old son and his friends playing with it. He had seen other people dumping their rubbish at the offices and did the same. “The refuse is attracting flies to our homes. We fear our kids will get sick,” said another resident. Umlazi Business Forum leader Sifiso Cele said contractors who hadn’t been paid by the municipality were angry. Spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the municipality, starting yesterday, had arranged for its own staff to collect rubbish under police escort.
