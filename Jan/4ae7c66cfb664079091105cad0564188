HE SNEAKED into gogo’s house at night while she was asleep. The suspect struck her several times on the head with a sharp object and she dropped to the floor. He then ransacked her house. The thug took some appliances and went to her bedroom, where he took several clothes, including her bras. The thug then went around selling gogo’s bras, but someone noticed them and notified cops. The suspect was bust with gogo’s bras on Monday and charged with murder. Gogo Ida Moletsane (84) from Sedibeng section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, was found by her son Joseph Moletsane last Sunday, lying in a pool of blood. “My cousin left to visit a relative and when she tried to call my mother, her phone was off. She contacted me, telling that she had been trying to call my mother, but her phone was off. I also contacted her, but her phone was off,” said Joseph. Joseph, who lives in Carletonville, had to drive to Tembisa to find out what was happening. He found some of his relatives there. They found gogo lying in a pool of blood. “It seems she was hacked on the head with a sharp object and died on the spot. The house was ransacked and some items in the house, including appliances, were missing,” said Joseph. “I was so heartbroken. I don’t know why the person who killed my mum didn’t take whatever he wanted and leave her alone.” Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha said a murder case was opened and the suspect appeared in the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Monday. He will appear in court again soon.
