CLIPSON Mphahlele (47) has been treated for bipolar disorder for more than six years, but he recently got some bad news. Clipson from Dithabaneng Village in Lebowakgomo, Limpopo, said: “Dr Ellias Raphadu has been transferred. I can’t imagine myself being treated by another doctor.” Clipson said other patients at Lebowakgomo Hospital were also unhappy to lose the doctor. “He was passionate about his work and he respected all his patients. Every time my review date came, I knew Dr Raphadu was going to treat me well.” Dr Raphadu said he knew the patients were not happy with his departure. “It was an instruction that I had to follow. Those patients were my people and I loved them,” he said. Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said: “People move for a number of reasons. Doctors often get better offers or want to further their studies.”
