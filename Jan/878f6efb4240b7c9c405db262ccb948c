Four people were arrested on Friday for participating in an alleged fake Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) jobs scam in Tembisa, in the east of Gauteng. According to JMPD spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, the alleged scam was discovered when a young woman went to the JMPD offices for a job after she paid "recruiters" thousands of rands. "It became apparent that she had been scammed and this led us to the arrest," Minnaar said. The JMPD warned the public that "jobs are not for sale". The four people, aged between 30 and 40, are being detained at the Tembisa police station and an investigation is under way. The police department was hit by a similar scam in November, when 23 job seekers from Limpopo each paid a scammer, who pretended to be a recruiter, between R2 800 and R20 000 for a job. "There is a hoax advert targeted at young, innocent people. These people spend over R2 800 to get a job that does not exist," Minnaar said. Minnaar warned the youth to be aware of fake job adverts and said the department did not advertise on social media but used newspapers instead. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/4-arrested-for-alleged-fake-jmpd-jobs-scam-20190111
