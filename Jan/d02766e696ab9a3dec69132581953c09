The City of Joburg Library’s e-learning Service has been
nominated for a United Nations(UN) Prize. The e-Learning Services were nominated for the UN’s World
summit on the Information Society Prize 2019. According to MMC for Community Devleopment Nonhlanhla
Sifumba, the e-Learning Unit submitted the e-Learning Classroom Projects to the
WSIS Stocktaking Database in October last year. “The WSIS Prize 2019 is a mechanism to evauluate and reward
stakeholders who have submitted projects for their efforts in the
implementation of WSIS outcomes,” Sifumba said. The World summit on the Information Society is a two-phase
summit aimed at addressing the issues raised by information and communication
technologies. “The goal of WSIS is to achieve a common vision, desire and
commitment to build a people-centric, inclusive and development-oriented
information society where everyone can access, utilize and share information,”
Sifumba also said.
