LOCAL truck drivers have given government until the end of next month to listen to their demands. This comes after they blockaded the N3 between Tugela Plaza and Van Reenens Pass in KZN on Sunday night. Sifiso Nyathi, leader of All Truck Drivers Foundation, told Daily Sun yesterday that Transport Minister Blade Nzimande had asked him to have drivers stop the blockade as he was dealing with their problems. Nyathi said the minister met them on Friday but they had still not received feedback. He said he spoke to the drivers and they agreed to give the minister more time. Many motorists near Harrismith were stuck in traffic for hours on Sunday night. According to Nyathi, one truck was burned during the incident. “We told the minister that by the end of next month we don’t want to see any foreign driver in the trucks. “These truck owners are undermining our labour laws by employing foreigners while there are many local drivers sitting at home,” he said. Mluleki Mntungwa, a spokesman for KZN Transport Department, said traffic cops cleared the road on Sunday night and all lanes were re-opened. He said Nzimande and Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda were working hard to resolve the drivers’ grievances.
