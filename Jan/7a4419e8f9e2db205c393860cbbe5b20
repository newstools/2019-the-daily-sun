NICHOLAS Ninow will spend 30 days at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Tshwane. The 20-year-old alleged Dros rapist will undergo mental observation at the hospital to check whether he is fit to stand trial. Ninow, who allegedly raped a seven-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in Silverton last year, appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday and is expected back there on the eighth of next month. Unlike his previous court appearances, the gallery was not full and there were no protests outside court, but members of the ANC Women’s League, the EFF and the #NotInMyName campaign were in the court. Ninow had waited for almost two months to get a bed at Weskoppies. The court has decided he will be assessed by three psychiatrists and one psychologist. #NotInMyName secretary Themba Masango said Ninow should not have been sent to a mental institution. He said the accused had no mental problems and should just face the courts. “This is delaying the matter and the family of the little girl needs closure. He has to answer to what he is accused of, so this case can be finalised,” Masango said.
