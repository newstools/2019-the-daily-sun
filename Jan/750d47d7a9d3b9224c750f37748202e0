AS murdered Constable Dwane Kemp (31) was being buried on Saturday, the Hawks were moving in on one of his alleged killers. That day, they bust the man allegedly involved in the shoot-out at the bakery in Central Port Elizabeth, where Kemp was killed. The cop died in hospital last Monday. Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said: “The 24-year-old suspect was arrested by the Hawks at his parents’ home in Algoa Park, Port Elizabeth.” He said the man was allegedly one of the five thugs who attacked the bakery. Four of them were killed, while he escaped. The suspect is expected to appear at Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court today on charges of murder, attempted murder, business robbery and other charges. Police Minister Bheki Cele made a call on Saturday at the constable’s funeral service for the fifth suspect to be arrested. “The long arm of the law knows no boundaries. “No matter where you hide, we will find you,” he said. He praised the Hawks for their swift action. Cele called on cops to use the tools given to them responsibly and decisively while doing their duty, and to do so within the law.
