Renowned DJ and philanthropist, Shimza is set to take his famous One Man Show abroad. The DJ put together the 10th edition of his annual show on Christmas day in his hometown of Tembisa where he hosted a range of DJs and artists in an effort to help raise funds for his charitable work. Shimza, whose real name is Ashley Raphala, has come a long way with his One Man Show and is now set to give the rest of the world a taste and make his dream come true. “Always dreamt of taking my One Man Show to the world, creating a “world tour” that will one day be as big in other countries as is in South Africa where it started. Djoonclub, thank you for believing in the dream and I can’t wait to see you,” he revealed on social media. If the previous installments of the show are anything to go by, Paris is in for a treat.
