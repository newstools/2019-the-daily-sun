THE man told his neighbours he had ordinary plants in his garden. But he was actually growing dagga and on Friday, his luck ran out when cops bust him. Neighbours of the 59-year-old from Jan Kempdorp, Northern Cape, said the man had lied for years until cops received a tip off about his activities last week. Dagga was planted behind a wire fence but residents thought it was vegetables. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi said: “The suspect was arrested and charged with dealing in dagga after the Kimberley K9 unit raided his home. “When cops arrived at his home they found dagga with an estimated street value of about R30 000. “The suspect is expected to appear in the Jan Kempdorp Magistrates Court soon.” “Dagga and tik worth about R680 were found in the suspects’ possession. “Both men will appear in the Pampierstad Magistrates Court soon,” said Mooi.
