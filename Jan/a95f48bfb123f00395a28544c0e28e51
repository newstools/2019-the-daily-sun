JULIUS Malema believes young people must stop making babies to chase grants! Speaking to the community of Mabopane, Tshwane before the launch of the EFF manifesto at Giant Stadium this Saturday, he said only responsible adults who are ready for children should have babies. He said public hospitals were collapsing as the government has failed to maintain them. Malema said the EFF has managed to close down corruption in Tshwane Municipality and said that they didn’t want corruption in Gauteng. He said the party doesn’t put anyone’s face on their T-shirts as they don’t glorify individuals. “People don’t need T-shirts, they need jobs.” Resident Asylina Magudulela (57) said she needs the EFF to help them with jobs as their children aren’t working. She also said she wasn’t happy because she didn’t get a T-shirt. Priscilla Nkosi (49) said she wants the EFF to help her with an RDP house while Susan Dithuri (60) said she doesn’t have lights or water. She said she would be voting even though she was unhappy. The party said it had opened a case against a Garsfontein woman caught by EFF officials removing EFF boards from the roadside. The boards were later found piled up in her house.
