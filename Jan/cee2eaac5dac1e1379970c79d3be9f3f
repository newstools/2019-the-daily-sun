THE Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in Limpopo has condemned the attempt on the life of its leader working for the Vhembe District Municipality. Tshililo Mosetho who is very vocal about the VBS looting, was shot by an unknown suspect at his home in Makwarela near Thohoyandou. Mosetho survived the shooting and was admitted to an undisclosed hospital. Cosatuâ€™s Gerald Twala said the federation strongly condemns the act of barbarism in the province, where there is relative political stability. Twala said this is the second shooting of this nature, with the same modus-operandi in the Vhembe Region. "Our suspicion is that there is a well-organized and funded campaign by political hyenas within the ANC, who are hell-bent on silencing any voice speaking against corruption and looting in our province. These political hyenas think that they can strike fear into the motive forces of our national democratic revolution by hiring assassins to silence legitimate voices," Twala said. Vhembe ANC spokesperson, Dali Tshifhiwa said this immoral act is unfortunate that it just happened when the president called on party members to unite against a common enemy of poverty, unemployment and inequality. Meanwhile police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo has called on members of the public to come forward with information that can assist to arrest the suspects.
