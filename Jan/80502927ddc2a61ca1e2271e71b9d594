AN MPUMALANGA gogo is seeking justice after allegedly being shot by cops on Thursday. Esther Khumalo (77) claims she was shot while fetching coal from a derailed train in Carolina. She told Daily Sun  they’ve never had problems before but the police were called. “They chased everyone away. I was struggling to move out when a cop said: ‘Hey wena gijima’. Next, I heard a shot and my cheek and arm were bleeding.” Gogo was rushed to hospital. She said: “It hurts that after 25 years of democracy police are treating us like this. It would be understandable if I were bust rather than shot.” Gogo wants to be compensated or have whoever shot her fired. After her daughter Lindiwe Khumalo (40) saidsteps would be taken, a case was opened on Friday at Carolina cop shop. Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe told Daily Sun a case has been opened against a police officer and said the case was referred to Ipid.
