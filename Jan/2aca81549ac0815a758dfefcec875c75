KHABISI Mosunkutu’s role in bringing peace to the taxi industry can never be forgotten. These were the words of Santaco’s Ralph Jones yesterday. The taxi boss was speaking at the funeral of the former Gauteng Transport MEC at Zoe Bible Church in Pimville, Soweto. Jones said Mosunkutu was the only man in government who cared for the taxi industry. He slammed government for not involving taximen in policy changes. “It’s people like ntate Mosunkutu who brought us closer to the movement,” he said. “But there are people in the movement who’re pushing us away, and the question is: what have you done for us?” He said the man they called Chesa Mpama added value. “When everybody was afraid of the taxi industry, he came into our lives and made a difference,” said Jones. He said Mosunkutu was instrumental in the formation of Santaco and in ending taxi violence. “Things started to change when Mosunkutu was removed as MEC,” said the taxi boss. Issuing a veiled warning, Jones called on government to rethink its approach to the industry in the build-up to the election. “There are some elements in the taxi industry who want to form a party because we’re not represented anywhere,” he said. “Even today, we say if only Mosunkutu was there the taxi violence taking place today would have been dealt with.” Mosunkutu died on Christmas Eve. He was buried at Westpark Cemetery in Joburg.
