THE Bakgatla ba Seabe  have been holding Diturupa celebrations since 1918. The event pays tribute to African soldiers who fought in World War 1. But on Tuesday the rain prevented Queen Selina Mabolope Chaane and her community from holding the event. She said: “We’re not disappointed. Instead, we’re happy we received rain that brought blessings to the community.” “We believe the rain brings happiness and blessings. Hopefully, there will be a lot of crops this year and our animals will be well fed. “This is a year of joy, wealth and good harvests.” The royal family plans to celebrate Diturupa in September. Event organiser Phopolo Chaane (40) said: “This is a good way to start 2019. Rain is a blessing.” He said residents were sad because they were looking forward to dancing for their neighbours and the royal family. He said a lack of sponsorship might have also affected the event. “We plan to give away prizes once we have sponsors.” Community member Mmutle Lepaaku (38) said: “We’re disappointed because we are used to celebrating on New Year’s Day.”
