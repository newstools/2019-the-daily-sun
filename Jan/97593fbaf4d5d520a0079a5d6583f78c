House music giant, Prince Kaybee has revealed that his mom was not happy with his choice to pursue a career in the arts. Like with most African parents, Prince Kaybee’s mom wanted him to do something a bit more “worthy” of his time. The producer and DJ whose real name is Kabelo Motsamai, let fans in on what his mom would’ve preferred he do instead of music. “Kabelo go be a police man, a soldier or a taxi driver, your time is running out and your son is growing,” his mom told him. The Banomoya hit-maker said that he understands what his mother meant, but he certainly had bigger dreams for himself. And lucky for us, he is finally living that dream.
