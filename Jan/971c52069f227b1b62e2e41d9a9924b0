CHOLESTEROL is a scary word. It always seems to be a sign of growing health problems and only a few people understand what it means for our health. Cholesterol comes in two types: HDL and LDL. HDL is high-density lipid – also known as good cholesterol. LDL means low-density lipid, also known as bad cholesterol. Fact is that HDL and LDL are not actually cholesterol, but lipoproteins – they are little packets that transport the cholesterol around the body in the blood stream.

Cholesterol is a critical part of a number of functions including bile and hormone production, as well as aiding vitamin D absorption. The liver makes cholesterol as part of food metabolism. While the quantity and quality of food play a key role – some livers produce more than others. PlaqueCalling LDL bad is wrong. LDL transports cholesterol to various tissues around the bodyin the blood stream. The problem is that they get caught up in damaged tissues and as more LDLs arrive, they get trapped too, which buildsup as plaque. Plaque is dangerous because it narrows or blocks the walls of arteries, veins and valves of the heart, which leads to strokes and heart attacks. Dr Rosetta Guidozzi, a doctor with an interest in weight management, said: “One vital factor to recognise is that the more fat that is carried around the abdomen, the more metabolically active that fat is.” What weight to watch“The more fat that is carried around the abdomen – the size of the belly – the higher the chance you have raised cholesterol levels,” Guidozzi said. Roughly, a waist circumference of more than 90cm in men and 85cm in women is a warning sign that a lifestyle change is necessary. People with high cholesterol levels should adopt healthy lifestyle measures.
