THE paramedic was on his way to save people’s lives  but ended up being hospitalised. Philani Nzuza (37) was stabbed several times on Saturday near the emergency medical services centre in Illovo, south of Durban. He sustained serious injuries to his chest and head, and colleagues rushed him to hospital. Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo visited Philani on Sunday. “It is worrying that a health worker in full uniform can be attacked by thugs in this manner,” said the MEC. “We are glad he survived. The people who attacked him must have been under the influence of something that made them lose touch with reality.” Dhlomo said during the struggle, health workers could go to hospitals and clinics while saving the lives of people injured by apartheid police. “This behaviour hinders our professionals from doing their national duty. “It is cruel and barbaric. May the police catch the culprits.” Cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said no case was opened.
