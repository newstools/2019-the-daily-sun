A TAXI ride to the shopping centre almost ended in tragedy last Friday. The taxi driver lost control of his vehicle and almost crashed into a house in M section of KwaMashu, north of Durban, leaving 14 passengers injured. The taxi was travelling to Bride City Shopping Centre when the driver stopped to pick up a passenger. He apparently lost control while reversing, veered off the road and landed in the yard of a house below the road. Nhlanhla Mbatha (29), whose family lives in the house, said his brother was sleeping when he was woken by a loud noise. He said he was shocked when he looked through the window and saw a taxi in the yard. “Fortunately, the taxi did not damage our house,” he said. He said four of the passengers sustained serious injuries and were rushed to hospital. “There was a three-month-old baby in the taxi, but the child survived. I don’t understand how the driver ended up in my yard. “Maybe he didn’t look into his mirrors properly. My brother almost died while he was sleeping. If the taxi had hit the house, I don’t think he would have survived.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that a taxi driver lost control of his vehicle. She said: “The taxi occupants were injured and taken to hospital for medical attention. A case of reckless and negligent driving was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station.”
