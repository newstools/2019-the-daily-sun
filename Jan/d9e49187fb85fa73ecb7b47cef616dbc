 FORMER president Jacob Zuma was in with son Duduzane when he appeared at the Randburg Magistrate's Court. The culpable homicide case against Duduzane has however been postponed to the 26th March for the trial to proceed. The judge advised the media to apply to record proceedings Mar and the matter will be heard the same court. Following this Duduzane will head to the Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Johannesburg, were his corruption charges are expected to be withdrawn. The reportedly NPA sent a letter to Duduzane Zuma's lawyers on Tuesday, notifying them of the provisional withdrawal of the charges. While the reason for that withdrawal was unknown, the letter follows the NPA's decision to provisionally withdraw charges against Gupta family members and associates late in 2018, in connection with the alleged Estina Dairy Project scam.
