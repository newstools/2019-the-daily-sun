THE Khoisan are ready and able to govern themselves. “Mzansi belongs to us as the first nation,” said traditional leader Chief Khoisan SA. “We have capable people who can run the country.” Presidency spokeswoman Khusela Diko said government was committed to addressing the Khoisan’s grievances. “The presidency wishes to outline its engagement with a few members of the Khoisan community who are camped on the lawns of the Union Buildings,” she said. Diko was referring to a list of demands the group wanted addressed immediately. “The presidency updated the group on progress made in response to demands presented in December 2017.” But Chief Khoisan SA said they wanted to be addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa himself. “The only thing we have to do is to talk to the South African government about the sharing of land, minerals and wealth,” he said. “We will report the South African government to the international community.” Chief Khoisan SA said his people were prepared to die for what is rightfully theirs. The group has been camping at the Union Buildings for nearly over a month. He said they also wanted all issues regarding land to be discussed with indigenous communities. “We also want khoekhoegowab to be made an official language.” The protesters relied on donations from Good Samaritans and said they were not worried about the weather.
