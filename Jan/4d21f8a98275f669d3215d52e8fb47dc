This is the last weekend that voters can register for the election. Young people are urged to register to vote. Chairman of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, Hlomani Chauke, said: “We urge all South Africans to take advantage of the last registration weekend to register to vote.” The voter registration weekend also provides the Independent Electoral Commission with the opportunity to update the voters’ roll. The country’s 22 932 voting stations will open from 8am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. According to the IEC, there are currently 26,1 million registered voters on the national common voters’ roll and it is hoped at least one million voters will be added to the roll. Registered voters can visit www.elections.org.za to check their current registration details and voting station location or update their details. They can also SMS their ID number to 32810 to receive an SMS with their registration status and the address of their closest voting station. Unregistered voters can add their address to the Voting Station Finder application on the website or call the contact centre on 0800 11 8000. - Meanwhile, Minister of Home Affairs Siyabonga Cwele visited the Home Affairs offices in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane yesterday to encourage the collection of IDs.
