A WAR of the wall is raging in Orange Farm, south of Joburg. Residents want a passage on the side of the house, but the Manquengue family have built a wall to stop them. Now residents have destroyed the wall. Antonnete Manquengue (31) said the wall came down on Sunday night at about 10pm. This was after residents had said the municipality gave them the right to pass through and that the family had no right to build the wall. “But they know very well this is our property,” she said. “They didn’t even talk to us. They just broke down the wall.” She said they built the wall with their own money. “We don’t owe them an explanation when we develop our yard,” she said. Antonnete said they went to the police, who sent them to the municipality. “The councillor sent somebody to deal with the problem, but he only told us the councillor wasn’t coming,” she told the People’s Paper. Antonnete’s sister Margarette (32) said she feared the people might attack them if they rebuilt the wall. “Some people understand but others are angry and unreasonable,” she said. She said if people could get this angry, they could do more and hurt them. City of Joburg spokesman Nthatisi Modingoane said they were aware of the dispute over a wall. He said they would send a team to investigate.
