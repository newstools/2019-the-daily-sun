THE State Capture Commission has heard that the African National Congress (ANC) Siyanqoba rallies were paid for by Bosasa. Agrizzi says election campaigns were run from the Bosasa offices, he explained that they had to cater for ANC rallies that had well over 50 000 people at times. He says they received absurd requests, including catering for birthday parties. “We would have to just do it,” Agrizzi said. According to Agrizzi former president Jacob Zuma’s 72nd birthday cake was paid for by Bosasa. He said the cake had the Bosasa logo on it, and it looked like a ‘tombstone’. The ex Bosasa top boss further said Minister of Environmental Affairs Nomvula Paua Mokonyane also received gifts from the company. He told the commission that when Mokonyane was still the MEC for Safety and Security in Gauteng, he met her a few times at the Bosasa offices. Agrizzi said Mokonyane received items that included over 120 cases of cold drinks, four cases of whisky, 8 lambs, 12 cases of frozen chickens, 200kg beef and 40 cases of beer. He added that the minister’s daughter who studied in China used to get hired cars. Reportedly the daughters would call Agrizzi personally to request cars like the Audi A3. The commission was told that she often got into accidents. Agrizzi says he always recorded all bribe the monies in his black book.
