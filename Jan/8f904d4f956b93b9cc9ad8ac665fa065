SIMON Nkosi told Daily Sun his life in the DA was very unpleasant. The former DA Emfuleni chief whip said he’d left the DA for something better, the Good party. He resigned at a council sitting on Friday at the Vaal municipality. He claimed he tried to raise issues with his leaders but ended up being prosecuted in the name of defending friendship and loyalty against colleagues. “The party that I viewed as my home is rife with nepotism, which only allows friends and family of MPs to get jobs. “For the past few years, my life has been a nightmare.” In his resignation letter, Nkosi raised issues in the regional office. “It’s full of friends, ex-girlfriends and the family of one person.” Caucus leader Dady Mollo said DA Emfuleni wishes Nkosi well in future endeavours.
