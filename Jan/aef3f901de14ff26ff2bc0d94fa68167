THE case of a 24-year-old mother who allegedly killed her four children last week has been postponed to 7 January. Zinhle Maditla’s case was on the Witbank Magistrates Court roll yesterday but was postponed as she is still in hospital. Zinhle and her four children, two girls and two boys aged 4, 8, 7 and 11 months, were last seen on 22 December. It is alleged that she spent days with their bodies in her rented room before neighbours became suspicious. Their bodies were found wrapped in blankets. Tenants raised the alarm when they saw flies between the curtains and an unbearable smell covered the yard. Zinhle handed herself over to the police and was charged with four counts of murder. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “We are continuing with our investigations. There are more charges we are busy with. “We urge community members who are going through circumstances that are beyond their comprehension to please seek professional help.”
