The King of filling up stadiums, Cassper Nyovest has found himself being the biggest joke on Twitter this week. Cassper embarrassed himself when he showed off his poor math skills on a very public platform. The fun began when an international news agency tweeted a story of a man who just turned 146-years-old this week, to which Mo Flava responded: “This old man has seen the 1800s, 1900s, and 2000s”. Cassper then tried to act all smart and call Mo out on his math, when in fact, he was the one who was wrong. “Don’t know about this maths though Mo,” he said. Since then, he has been made fun of to no end with the Tsibipians saying they are embarrassed and other people telling him to stick to filling up stadiums and let Mo count how many fans turned out. Lmao right? He later tried to make light of the situation and pretended that he was joking but of course, no one was buying it. "Y’all are soooo easy to Provoke," he claimed.
