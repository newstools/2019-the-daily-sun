A GRADE seven pupil has allegedly been stabbed to death by another pupil in the same grade. According to the Eastern Cape Department of Education, it happened at Mpeko Primary School in Peddie on Thursday morning. Department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: “MEC Mlungisi Mvoko mourns the death of a 14-year- old grade 7 pupil at the primary school in Amathole West. “He was allegedly stabbed to death by a 17-year-old grade 7 boy at the same school. “The department has sent officials to the family to report the matter. “We will provide counselling for all pupils and teachers of the school,” he said. The MEC sent his condolences to the dead pupil’s family and the education fraternity. “My condolences to the bereaved family and I hope they will find solace in the Lord during this trying time,” Mvoko said. It is not the first time that a pupil has died at the school. In September, an 18-year-old pupil was allegedly also killed by a fellow pupil in class at Nathaniel Pamla Secondary School. It was reported that the 16-year-old stabbed his classmate after they fought over a missing cellphone. The 18-year-old died instantly from his stab wounds.
