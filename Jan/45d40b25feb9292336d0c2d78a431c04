THE trial of a mum accused of killing her four children was yesterday postponed to 14 February. Zinhle Maditla from Klarinet, Mpumalanga, missed her first appearance at the Witbank Magistrates Court on 2 January as she was in hospital. Maditla’s children, aged between 11 months and eight years of age, were last seen on 26 December. Their bodies, which were wrapped in blankets, were found inside her house on 30 December. Residents said they became suspicious Fthat afternoon when they saw flies between the curtains and windows of her room. There was also a terrible smell in the yard. Maditla handed herself over to the police and was charged with four counts of murder. The children will be buried today. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said: “When she appears again it is possible she might get bail or the matter will be postponed. If it means we have to settle for that we will do so.”
