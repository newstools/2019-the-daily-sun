Mafikizolo singer, Nhlanhla Nciza has found herself in a rather sticky situation. The Twitter streets are having a field day with the star’s messy hairdo at this past weekend’s Sun Met in Cape Town. To this day, that hairdo is still a topic of discussion. And to make matter worse, even her outfit was terrible, her make-up was bad and she was even dragged for the way her boobs were sitting in that outfit. With her band member, Theo Kgosinkwe by her side as usual, Nhlanhla attended the horse-racing event in a brown bodysuit and a matching kimono on top. But her terrible outfit had nothing on her hair, which unfortunately for her, stole the show. The award-winning performer had faux locs that looked as though they still needed to set. And what is going on with that hairline? Oh no girl, get it together. Here are our favourite reactions:
