THE people of Mzansi must be protected from alcohol abuse. This is what Minister of Police Bheki Cele said while destroying more than 10 000 litres of alcohol at Belhar in Cape Town yesterday. The alcohol was confiscated by the police. “Alcohol consumption contributes to drownings and car accidents,” he said. Cele said alcohol is regulated but there are people who break the law by selling it without licences. “To run an outlet you must have a licence. But there are licensed businesses who break the rules by selling liquor to under-18s and by operating until 4am,” said Cele. He said restricting alcohol was one of the tools cops had to fight crime. He said there was a connection between alcohol use and crimes such as murder and attempted murder, and even sexual assault. Cele also condemned the Clifton Beach incident where people were allegedly chased away from the beach. Western Cape MEC for Community Safety Alan Winde told the SunTeam there had been an improvement on beach drinking this year. “Officials have confiscated less alcohol than last year. We’re happy that people are respecting alcohol-free beaches,” he said.
