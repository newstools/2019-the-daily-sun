MADALA no longer has to worry about going to the toilet. This is because a group of young people in his community built him a flushing toilet. Edward Ladzani (87) of Phiphidi, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, is partially sighted. He’s fallen on a number of occasions while going to an outside pit toilet. The toilet was in the far corner of his yard and it was no longer safe for him to use at night. His neighbour, Khathutshelo Mphaphuli, realised he neededa toilet in the house. With nine of his friends from the same street, they bought him a toilet set, including a basin. The new toilet was handed over on Wednesday. Khathutshelo said he could not stand watching the madala struggle to relieve himself far from his house. “We sat down and decided to make some contributions and bought the toilet set. “We also dug a septic hole. All this was done on a voluntary basis,” he said. “This goes to show that one does not need to have millions to help others. “The little that one can do to help another goes a long way to changing the lives of others.” He said the madala was the only elder left in their street. “We encourage other young people to help in their communities. We will continue to be agents of change in this community,” said Khathutshelo.
