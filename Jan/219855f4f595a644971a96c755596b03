SIX goals in 17 matches! It hasn’t taken Muhsin Ertugral a long time to figure out the real problems pulling Maritzburg United back in their quest to move off the bottom of the Absa Premiership. Winless in 13 straight league matches, the Team of Choice already look like a side doomed for relegation. But with 13 matches left, it may still be early to predict their season. “This is the 17th game and only six goals have been scored. I came to the club... sometimes I don’t know why I’m putting myself in situations like these, but the club needs help,” said Ertugral, following yet another defeat, this time to Mamelodi Sundowns (1-0) on Wednesday night. “It’s clear to see where the problem is. It’s the playing pattern. It’s tactical. We need to create chances and score. We need to get into the entries more. “This team was number four on the log last season. New players have come in, others have left. Everybody knew that the attacking format was right through the middle. And to change the mindset is not easy. “But the middle-attacking format doesn’t work anymore for Maritzburg. It has to change.” Ertugral, who is outspoken on his tactical beliefs and philosophy, explained Sundowns weren’t their direct rivals. But they are targeting points from fellow bottom dwellers, including Chippa United, who they visit at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). “Sundowns are not the reality. Our reality is AmaZulu, Chippa United and Free State Stars. We will raise our game. “But the players need to think about what kind of football they want to play. Youngsters need to learn not to dribble too much without creating chances.” Ertugral said Yannick Zakri was back in the country from the Ivory Coast after sorting out his visa issues. He will be available for selection tomorrow. “Having a player like Zakri will lift us,” Ertugral said. “We need him upfront to hold on to the ball. Sometimes we play ping pong football and it doesn’t help.”
