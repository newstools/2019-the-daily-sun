BANYANA Banyana star Thembi Kgatlana says she’s honoured to be recognised by continental football authority, the Confederation of African Football (Caf), following an impressive year. For the second consecutive time Kgatlana has made the final top three for the Caf Women’s Player of the Year 2018. The Caf Awards will be held in Dakar, Senegal on 8 January. Her nomination follows Banyana’s impressive triumph at the Cosafa Women’s Championship played in Port Elizabeth and Africa Women Cup of Nations that was held in Ghana late last year. The 22-year-old striker played a key role when Banyana made history by finishing in the top three of the Women’s Afcon to qualify for their first ever World Cup to be held in France later this year. She also finished the tournament as the top goal scorer with five goals, scoring in each and every match except for the final where Banyana lost 4-3 to Nigeria on penalties after they drew goalless at full-time. Kgatlana was also voted as the player of the tournament in Ghana. The Banyana and Houston Dash striker is nominated with Nigeria’s duo, Asisat Oshoala (last years winner) and Francisca Ordega. Last year, Kgatlana lost out to Oshoala but now she has a good chance of being crowned Queen of African Football and become the second Banyana player to have won it after Noko Matlou in 2008. The unselfish Kgatlana refused to take credit alone, she said: “I’m speechless, although I must admit I’m not surprised because we worked extremely hard this year as the team. Credit also goes to my teammates. Being nominated for the second time is a sign that we are heading to the right direction.” “Its an honour to be nominated twice in a row at this stage.”
