The Proteas have lost their first ever "Pink Day" match after Pakistan dominated the fourth ODI at the Wanderers, winning by eight wickets. After inserting the home side to bat, Pakistan took the wickets of Quinton de Kock (0) and Reeza Hendricks (2) to leave the Proteas in early trouble at 18/2. Proteas captain, Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla then went about repairing the damage with a 112 run partnership before a massive collapse saw the home side lose 8 wickets for 44 runs. Amla (59) and Du Plessis (57) top scored for the hosts with Usman Shinwari (4/35) the pick of the Pakistan bowlers. Pakistan were never really in trouble chasing the low victory target especially after a 70 run opening partnership between Fakhar Zaman (44) and Imam ul-Haq. Ul-Haq and Babar Azam (41) were then untroubled as they steered the visitors to an emphatic victory despite, Ul-Haq (71) losing his wicket with the scores level. The series tied is now tied at 2-2 and will be decided by the final match set to take place at Newlands on Wednesday. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
