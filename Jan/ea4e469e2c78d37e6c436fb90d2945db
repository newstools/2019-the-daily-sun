THE race for the MultiChoice Diski challenge crown has intensified as Premier Soccer League (PSL) reserve teams gun for the title. The league is nearing its conclusion and teams at the top cannot afford any slip ups. With only four games left in this year’s edition, there’s no room for error as a host of teams are still in with a chance of claiming the title. Cape Town City and Bloemfontein Celtic, who are in search of their maiden MDC title, are currently the joint pace setters. They have been two of the league’s most consistent teams this year. However, both teams dropped points last week as they played to 1-1 draws against Mamelodi Sundowns and AmaZulu respectively. Despite the setback, the teams still occupy first and second position, with 23 points from eleven games and are only separated by goal difference. City coach Richard Lovell says his team need to rediscover their hunger for the final four games if they want to be crowned champions. Lovell’s charges take on Baroka FC at the Cape Town Stadium tomorrow (10am). “I think we took our foot off the pedal a bit and played a really disappointing game against Sundowns,” he said. “For some reason we just did not click. We lost the ball far too often and our rhythm just wasn’t there.” Lovell hopes that their closest rivals Celtic will have their usual slip up in the final games. Celtic have lost out on the MDC title twice in the dying stages. They were also runners up last season. “Obviously we are hoping a few results favour us, but we are not too concerned with what others are doing,” added Lovell. “All we are focused on is winning all of our remaining matches and giving ourselves the best chance of winning the title.” Elsewhere, Polokwane City face Highlands Park at Makhulong, while Free State Stars meet Golden Arrows at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium.
