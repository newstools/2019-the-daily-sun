EDMORE Kizito (38) said he’s living in fear that he’ll run into his former boss. This comes after a video of his mlungu boss moering him went viral last week. On Friday, Daily Sun published a story about how he was beaten after demanding his salary. He said the trouble started on 31 December when he went to a bar in Tshwane to get his salary. He said his boss became angry with him because he had earlier refused to work a double shift. “I went out to get a taxi and he followed me. That was when he beat me,” he said. Edmore said since he started working at the bar eight years ago, his boss had been beating employees. “Month-end was always a nightmare for us. He would accuse employees of stealing and beat them.” Edmore claimed his boss wanted him to tell the media they were only play fighting. “He phoned me and read a statement he had prepared for me.” Edmore said he’d never set foot in the bar again but wanted his salary. Captain Rebecca Phatlane said an assault case was opened, but the suspect was on the run.
