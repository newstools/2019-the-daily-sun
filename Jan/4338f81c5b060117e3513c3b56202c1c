IF YOU abuse animals, don’t let authorities catch you because you’ll end up in jail! This is the message the SPCA is sending to communities. “Animals have hearts, too, just like humans,” said SPCA inspector Mishack Matlou. Matlou told Daily Sun that he met the owner of a brown dog in Ga-Rankuwa View, Tshwane, on 26 December last year. “The dog was not in good condition and very ill,” he said. He urged the owner to take the dog to the Themba Animal Clinic in Hammanskraal as it was free. Matlou followed up and discovered the owner never took the dog to the clinic. “He told me I must leave him alone because it’s his dog. When I inspected the dog, there was blood coming out of its 4-5 and the ribs of the dogs were exposed,” he said. Matlou approached the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court and got an order to remove the dog from the owner. “After being accompanied by the police, I managed to remove the dog from its owner. We took the dog to Pyramid Animal Hospital near Pretoria North,” he said. Matlou said the vets said the dog was too ill and they put it down. He said anyone found abusing animals will be bust and charged. Anyone who wants to report animal-related issues should call 012 8035 219 or 083 4533 863.
