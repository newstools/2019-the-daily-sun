LIVID SuperSport United CEO, Stan Matthews, didn’t mince his words when he said Thuso Phala’s clearance letter was ready and that any club that wanted the talented winger should pay the money or wait for his contract to expire in six months’ time. Matsatsantsa a Pitori are seemingly tired of the player’s erratic behaviour and are ready to part ways with him before the end of his contract. But they’re not prepared to do it for free. Phala has been suspended for disciplinary issues by the three-time league champions. He will go for a disciplinary hearing with the club’s top brass this week. The 32-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder has stopped training with the club. Matthews says no club has approached them to inquire about the availability of the player., despite reports that Orlando Pirates are interested in him. Matthews said: “We have not been approached for Phala. He has six months left on his contract. Thuso has a disciplinary hearing against him this week. “I told him his clearance letter is ready for collection. My door is always open for him to talk to me any time. But he’s now suspended and not training with us. “Details of his suspension are confidential. I don’t want to discuss them in public.” Matthews made it clear Phala won’t stay at the club beyond the expiry of his contract. “He won’t be with us next season. We wanted to give him a propersend-off, as he contributed to our success in the past couple of years. But that won’t happen because of his behaviour,” he said. With the January transfer window deadline approaching, any team willing to cough up the money to buy the player out of his six-month contract is welcome. “Show us the money and you’ll get your player, or sign a pre-season contract and wait for the end of the season,” Matthews added.
