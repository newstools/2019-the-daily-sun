MTHUNZI Dlamini is an angry man and has run out of patience. His life has been on hold since 1998 because of an ID problem. The 42-year-old man from Zola, Soweto, said he used to work for a railway project. When his contract ended he was advised to claim from his provident fund. “But I was told I couldn’t access my money because a stranger and I shared an ID number. “I immediately went to Home Affairs in Orlando and told them about my problem. “They said they would help me get my ID number back.” He was told to get a letter from the hospital where he was born, and a letter from his primary school, so he could apply for a new ID. “I brought all the required documents, and they said they would fix my problem within six weeks,” he said. In 1999 he went back to Home Affairs but was told to reapply. “A lot of opportunities have passed me by because I don’t have an ID. “I’ve tried everything, but all my efforts have been in vain.” Mthunzi said he fears his 13-year-old son won’t be able to use his surname because of his ID problem. The frustrated Mthunzi told Daily Sun he went to Home Affairs last year and was given a new ID number. When he applied for a smart ID card, he was told his ID number was not in the system. Spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter was referred to the Gauteng manager. “I’ve asked them to contact the client and gather information to help resolve the issue.”
