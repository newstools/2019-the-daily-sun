With over 15-million units sold, the Clio is Renault's best-selling vehicle in the world. And now Renault is getting ready to reveal the 5th generation of the Clio. Ahead of its official reveal at the Geneva Auto Show in March the company has revealed the new car's interior. And like its counterparts, the Clio is hoping screen real estate and connectivity will get you in the driver's seat. The centre console is dominated by a huge screen that looks like it crash-landed on the dash. The instrument cluster also has screens instead of traditional gauges. The overall looks more premium than its predecessor. "The interior has undergone a true revolution, with a considerable improvement in perceived quality, greater sophistication and technology. It is the best Clio ever.‚Äù Laurens van den Acker, Senior Vice President, Corporate Design said. No word on the connectivity options yet, but we expect Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to be on offer. The new Clio sits on Renault's new CMF-B platform. The electrical and electronic architecture makes it easy to integrate the latest technologies to respond to new market requirements.
