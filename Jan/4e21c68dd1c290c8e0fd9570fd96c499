PRELIMINARY investigations show that Marks Rambau’s cars disappeared on the night he was killed. And the 48-year-old’s family in Vuwani, Limpopo, believes his death was planned. They also suspect one of his vehicles, a VW Polo, could have been used to move his body. Rambau’s partially burned body was dumped next to Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday night. Rambau was the deputy director of service delivery at the Limpopo department of transport. Police are still trying to find Rambau’s beige Jeep Wrangler with registration number CJP 881 L and his blue VW Polo with registration number BLM 773 L. His uncle, Robert Khangale, said the family believed he was strangled as there were no wounds on his body. “It’s still hard for us to accept his death. It’s suspicious because the people who killed him knew where he was. He used his Polo for work and his Jeep was always parked at his office. So why did he have both cars at one place that day?” he asked. Robert told Daily Sun they had to break the door of Rambau’s house to gain entry, but found nothing that suggested he might have been killed there. Limpopo Transport and Community Safety MEC Makoma Makhurupetje, ANC regional deputy secretary Bioskop Makamu, former Mopani mayor Joshua Matlou and MP Silence Makhubela visited the Rambau family yesterday. A team of investigators was put together by provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba. Police have offered a R50 000 reward for any information leading to the culprits’ arrest. Anyone with information can contact Captain Philip Sekhwela on 072 717 8344 or Captain Makokona Ntini on 073 149 0140.
