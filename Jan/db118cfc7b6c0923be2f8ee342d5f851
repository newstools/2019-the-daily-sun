IT IS a disaster waiting to happen. And unions are worried about their members’ safety. This after worker Elizabeth Nkosi collapsed and died at the Civitas building in Tshwane. The building houses the department of health. Yesterday the Public Servants Association of South Africa told Daily Sun its members would not work until their grievances were heard. Some of the problems included unsafe working conditions and a lack of air circulation. The association’s Reuben Maleka said: “Our condolences to Elizabeth Nkosi’s family on their loss. “This could’ve been avoided at the time we raised concerns with Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi.” He said they also had a long talk with Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi on the matter. “The minister agreed with the report by the inspector of labour last year,” he said. Health spokesman Popo Maja said the minister was expected to brief the media on the matter soon. Meanwhile, workers blamed Motsoaledi for Elizabeth’s death. They claimed she experienced breathing difficulties, which were allegedly caused by the dust at work.
