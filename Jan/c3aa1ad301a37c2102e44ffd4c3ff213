WHEN Philemon “Chippa” Masinga was at his lowest, nobody was there! These were the words of his friend Majoro Nguphane, who came out guns blazing at the memorial service in Soweto on Monday. “When the lights were off in his house, I was there. Nobody was there. “Today Masinga is no more and everybody wants to come here and give us nice stories.” Majoro said he and Chippa came a long way. He said things that were said at Chippa’s memorial service were what’s always said at other fallen football stars’ memorial services. “It’s very painful that Masinga is no more, and he’s not even on the Safa wall of fame. “He took us to France in 1998, but he’s not even on the wall and you want us to believe that it’s alright,” said Majoro. Former Mamelodi Sundowns striker Eric “702” September said he still could not believe his twin was no more. Former Mamelodi Sundowns spokesman Alex Shakoane put Chippa in the ranks of international sport stars. He said his three children’s education would be taken care of. Chippa will be buried in Khuma, North West, on Thursday.
