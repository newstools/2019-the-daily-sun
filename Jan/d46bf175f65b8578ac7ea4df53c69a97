COVERING school books can be a nightmare if you can’t do it properly. It’s even worse for working parents who don’t have time to do it. After seeing how people struggled, University of the Western Cape student Seipati Lehata started covering books to make money before going back to campus. The third year education student from Greenfields in Lwandle, Strand, near Cape Town told Daily Sun: “The idea was born in high school but was never implemented because I was worried about people’s reaction.” She uses social media to advertise her business and it’s helped her attract customers from as far as Kuilsriver, about 28km away. Her mother Rorisanga Lehata said she was very proud of her daughter, who not only has a business but also worked part-time at a supermarket. Seipati said one of her main challenges was that the demand for her services was high which meant she had sleepless nights. She said her business will close at the end of next month and re-open in January.
