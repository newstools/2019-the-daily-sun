IT seems Mzansi people have found a new mode of transport for rainy days. But this one doesn’t have seats. In a video making the rounds on social media recently, pedestrians are seen being transported on a flat trolley across a flooded street in the Joburg CBD. There’s a fee for this service but it’s understood passengers pay as little as R2. The service is said to have started during the recent heavy rains, which led to most parts of the country experiencing floods. In the video, at least three trolley-pushers are seen hard at work. It appears to be the rush hour as they speedily push one person across the road and quickly make a U-turn to collect the next. Women and men used their service in an attempt to avoid getting their pants and shoes wet, while other pedestrians turned down their service and walked right through the flooded street. One of the trolley-pushers, George Moyo, told Daily Sun: “I’m so proud of my fellow brothers for coming up with such a great idea.It’s difficult to find a job. Instead of resorting to crime, we looked for ways to make money. “I had been using my trolley to collect and sell waste. But I’ll be pushing people when there are floods again.” “They said the idea came after they saw people getting their clothes wet as they tried to cross the street.
