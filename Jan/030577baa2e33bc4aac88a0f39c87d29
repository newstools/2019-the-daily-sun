THE last time the Seeco family saw their 13-year-old niece, Hope, was three days before New Year’s Day. The family from Luzuko, Cape Town, is appealing to SunReaders to help them find Hope. Nombulelo Seeco, Hope’s 31-year-old aunt, said her niece disappeared on 29 December. “We need to find her,” said Nombulelo. Hope, who was wearing a pink dress and had braided hair, went outside to play at a nearby park after eating lunch and did not return home. Nombulelo said Hope is a slow learner who enjoys playing with kids younger than her. “Although she is 13 years old, her mind is like that of a five-year-old,” said Nombulelo. Hope is originally from Gugulethu, also in Cape Town, and was visiting her siblings when she went missing. Nombulelo added that Hope knew her way around the area. Constable Anam Nciya from Philippi East Police Station confirmed that a child was reported missing and police have been searching the area. She appealed to anyone who might have information about Hope’s whereabouts to contact her family on 066 243 0517 or Philippi police on 021 370 9000/4.
