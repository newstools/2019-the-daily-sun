LAST week, Lower Crossroads residents from Philippi East in Cape Town called Daily Sun because for two weeks, they had a blocked drain. Daily Sun published the story of their troubles yesterday. They had to use stones and tyres to cross the street to avoid stepping in sewage. After the SunTeam visited the area last Wednesday, the drain was fixed the next day. Luyolo Cokana (46) said: “When we called Daily Sun,  we hoped this would finally be fixed. “We are happy now. “This drain was fixed the next day. We were surprised because we reported the matter for two weeks without any luck.” He went on to say the newspaper is really the People’s Paper because when they had a problem, the SunTeam helped them. Mlungisi Magaqa (36) told Daily Sun they could finally enjoy the sun outside after being trapped in their houses. He said it’s a shame that for the municipality to fix problems, the media has to be involved.
