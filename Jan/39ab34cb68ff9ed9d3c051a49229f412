THE name of Chippa Masinga will be on display when the exhibition centre for South Africa’s sports history is complete. This is what Sports Minister Tokozile Xasa promised after meeting Masinga’s family in Khuma, Stilfontein near Klerksdorp, North West, yesterday. The soccer legend died on Sunday morning. Xasa said the youngsters and the current Bafana Bafana squad must live up to the standard set by Chippa on the soccer field. “He was a great ambassador for football and inspired young people worldwide. We came to encourage the family. We all have fond memories of him.” Xasa said they were working to get everyone to bring books, photos and other material about the history of the country’s sport to be placed in an exhibition centre for future generations. “The people must also bring material about unsung heroes as well.” Former Safa boss Molefi Oliphant, who was with the minister, said Chippa’s death was a great loss.
