THE fraud case against former acting CEO of Prasa, Mthuthuzeli Swartz, has been postponed to 27 February. Swartz (58) was bust by the Hawks on Tuesday for alleged fraud and money laundering. He appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court on the same day and was granted R2 000 bail. Eastern Cape Hawks spokeswoman Captain Anelisa Feni told Daily Sun: “Swartz was arrested on Tuesday and taken to court on the same day by the Hawks serious organised crime unit. “This followed allegations that he and an accomplice defrauded a 41-year-old businessman. “It is alleged they misrepresented themselves as having authority to sell a Transnet railway line between Elliot and Maclear.” Feni said the businessman paid R1,5 million into the suspects’ bank account. She said the victim never received the promised railway line in spite of the payment allegedly being made. “The Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court granted Swartz R2 000 bail. The search for the second accomplice continues.” Swartz has held numerous positions at the rail agency. These include Western Cape regional manager and, more recently, executive manager for mainline passenger services. He was removed as acting CEO in April.
