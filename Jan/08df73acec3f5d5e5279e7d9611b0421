House music sensation, Busiswa is switching things up in 2019 and trying her luck at TV presenting. The Banomoya has been revealed as the co-host of the second season of Mtv Base’s Gqom music and dance show, Gqom Nation. She will take on her new role alongside season one presenter, Thando Duma who held down the hosting duties by herself for past two years. The show is based and filmed in the birthplace of Gqom music, KwaZulu-Natal where each week skilled KZN dancers break it down to the mostly underground beats of the electrifying genre that is Gqom. For the new season, set to premier this month, the production will seek to unearth and showcase new and emerging talent from the province.
