ANGRY workers threatened to keep the office shut until their arrested colleague is released from jail. Mkhambathini municipal workers in Camperdown, KZN, abandoned work and protested outside the municipality yesterday. They blocked the entrance with burning tyres and rubbish. Their anger was triggered by the arrest of a receptionist, who received a sealed envelope last year who asked her to give it to the municipal manager. When the manager opened the envelope, he allegedly found a bullet inside. The municipal manager then opened a case of intimidation and the receptionist was bust on Wednesday. South African Municipal Workers Union secretary Mbongwa Dlamini said the receptionist was doing her job. “When the municipal manager opened the envelope, he discovered a bullet inside. Perhaps he felt threatened. He went to the police and reported the matter.” “Workers will not go back to work until the receptionist is released from jail.” Municipal speaker Bongani Gwala said workers were angry after their colleague was bust. “We entered the building through the back. We are still going to meet with the mayor and discuss a way forward.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a 43-year-old suspect was arrested for intimidation.
