THE Many family needs help to find their missing relative. Moses Many (46) from Navalsig was last seen wandering next to a railway line in Bloemfontein last Saturday. His family reported Moses missing after he didn’t return home. The Manys said they were very worried because Moses needed medication for his epilepsy.
