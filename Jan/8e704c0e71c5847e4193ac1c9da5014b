 “THEY are sentencing the idea, not me,” These were the words of the fees must fall activist,
Bonginkosi Khanyile following his sentencing at the Durban Regional Court. Handing down the sentence, Magistrate Simphiwe Hlophe said
he was sentencing Khanyile to three years house arrest and must undergo life
skills courses. He was further ordered to pay a R5000 fine or serve a
three-year prison sentence, suspended for five years. He was found guilty of public violence, failing to comply
with a police investigation and possession of a dangerous weapon in August
2018. This comes after his arrest in 2016 during the nationwide
fees must fall protests. Following the sentencing Khanyile said: “I accept the sentence
with honour and pride because it was for a good course. They are sentencing the
idea, not me. I consider myself a free and an innocent man.” He went on to say that whatever that has happened in court,
they are not shaken from their position of fighting for the course of free
education. “We did what we did for the course that we believe in. If
the circumstances were to repeat themselves, we are still going to demand the
question of free education,” said Khanyile. Khanyile said some of the universities still required
students to pay registration fee. “This means we don’t have free education entirely on South
Africa and we are saying with this, young people should not be deterred,” said
Khanyile. He said he will have to report to the nearest police station
and if he wants to leave the province he will also have to report. Khanyile was a student at the Durban University of
Technology at the time of the protests. Khanyile pleaded guilty to charges of public violence,
failing to comply with police instructions and the possession of a dangerous
weapon.
