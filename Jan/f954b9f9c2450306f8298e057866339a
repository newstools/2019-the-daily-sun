IN the wake of the raging debate social media about #OpenUpTheIndustry, veteran actress Florence Masebe has come out in support of SABC’s former COO Hlaudi Motsoneng’s 90 percent policy, which he implemented during his tenure at the public broadcaster. She said had some people not been against, there would be ample space for new faces and talent to enter, because there would be more production. By the way, the biggest opportunity to #OpenUpTheIndustry was the 90% local content move that your smarts quickly shot down at SABC. More local content would have meant more production activity and more exposure for creatives that don't always get attention. Be it in music or TV,” she wrote.
