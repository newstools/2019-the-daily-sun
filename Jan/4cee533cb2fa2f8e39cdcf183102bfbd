Police found the burnt body of a middle-aged man in Eersterust, east of Pretoria, on Tuesday morning. It is suspected that the man was killed in a mob justice attack. According to police, the unidentified man was burnt to death and his body was discovered in the bushes. Police spokesperson Constable Herman Moremi said they had also found burning tyres, plastic, rocks and sticks near the body. "A community member, who was busy at his farm, saw plus-minus six vehicles full of people around the bushes and later he heard the man screaming for help then he saw big smoke from that side," Moremi said in a statement. He added that the deceased was found still burning. Police have opened a case of murder and are urging anyone who is looking for a family member or with information about the suspects to come forward and contact Temba police on 012 717 9000. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-found-burnt-to-death-in-a-suspected-mob-justice-attack-20190122
