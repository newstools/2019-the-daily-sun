PITCH BLACK AFRO and Trisha had been together for 23 years. And in that time, he claimed, he had never laid a hand on her. BUT TODAY HE IS APPEARING IN COURT,  ACCUSED OF HER MURDER! Speaking to Daily Sun on Tuesday before he was arrested, the rapper was confident. He said if he was responsible for his wife’s murder the cops would have bust him by now. The People’s Paper reported yesterday on the death of Catherine Modusane, known as Trisha, who died on 31 December due to unknown causes. According to a source close to the couple, a fight between Pitch Black Afro and the dead woman started at a friend’s flat in Bellevue, Joburg, when she told their friends that 2019 would be their year because they had cracked an Illuminati code. “We could see the anger build on Pitch Black Afro’s face,” said the source. “He told her it was not for everybody to know and it was supposed to be their secret.” Pitch Black Afro and Trisha then went back to their B&B, but Trisha was soon back at the flat, claiming she had been beaten. “When we went to check up on them in the morning, Trisha appeared to be sleeping but she had bruises on her face.” There were bloody towels in the room which were later taken by the cops. “I could see she was lifeless but I thought she had overdosed. But then what would have explained the bruises?” SAPS spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said Trisha’s husband was bust on Tuesday. “The suspect is detained at Yeoville SAPS. This is now a murder case,” said Dlamini. The rapper will appear in court today.
