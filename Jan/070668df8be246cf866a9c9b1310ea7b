SINCE December, kids have been nagging their parents to take them to Menlyn Park Shopping Centre in Tshwane. They are attracted to the centre by the Zip Zap circus. From flying saucers to clowns who perform scary stunts, the circus leaves everyone gasping for air and off their seats. Zip Zap is made up of poor kids who are from Cape Town. The circus was founded in Cape Town in 1992. Its aim is to inspire young people and help build a culture of peaceful coexistence in the country. Zip Zap’s programmes are all free to participants, with financial and material support coming from individuals, organisation, corporations and foundations. Olive Ndebele, general manager at the centre, said the mall was simply doing what it was meant for. “All we want to do is to keep our customers happy. We want to make shopping exciting and a family thing,” she said. Malebo Magoro (11) said her dad promised to take her to the circus every day. “I passed well and he said I should ask for anything. Every day after work he finds me ready,” she said.
