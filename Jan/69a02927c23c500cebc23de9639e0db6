MOST people are looking forward to having a great year but Nontsingiselo Nwebane from Marcus Garvey in Philippi said hers was already ruined. The 51-year-old said her Congolese boyfriend Amos “Celestino” Alengabo (41) was stabbed to death on New Year’s Day by thugs who robbed him of his cellphone. She was also robbed on the day of his funeral in Delft. Nontsingiselo said she last spoke to her boyfriend on 31 December while she was at her family home in Gugulethu. She said they had planned to meet the following day. “I was shocked when my neighbour and my boyfriend’s cousin knocked on my door in the middle of the night but I knew something was wrong. “They told me Celestino had been stabbed and was dead.” Nontsingiselo said she was heartbroken to have lost the love of her life. “On the day of his funeral, I was sleeping in a room with other women at my boyfriend’s house in Delft.” Nontsingiselo said they were easy targets for thugs because many of their cellphones were charging “They took all our cellphones and handbags, including mine. My clothes, bank cards, cellphone, toiletries and R170 were in my bag.” Nontsingiselo said she was disappointed that although they had called cops, they failed to arrive. “Had the cops arrived, they could have arrested them.” Police spokeswoman Constable Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A murder case has been opened for investigation with no arrests so far. “Nontsingiselo should open a robbery case in Delft in order for it to be investigated. “She can also approach Delft management if she is unhappy with the service of the Delft police.”
