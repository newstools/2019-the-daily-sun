WHEN Nomvuyo Lingani heard gunshots, she hid immediately. “I know a lot of people have lost their lives when they got caught up in something that had nothing to do with them,” said the 36-year-old from Delft in Cape Town. She said she saw the gunmen driving a silver Polo on Monday. “They shot and killed an innocent man.” Resident Luvuyo Jacobs (56) said he was happy with the way the community helped the police catch the two suspects. “The community showed the police where the suspects went,” said Luvuyo. He said criminals do as they please in Delft because they know they probably will not get caught. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cops are investigating the murder of a 28-year-old. “Police followed up on information that led them to the vehicle. The suspects jumped out of the car and shot at the police, who returned fire,” said Rwexana. She said two suspects, aged 33 and 34, were arrested. “They will appear in the Bellville Magistrates Court for murder and illegal possession of firearms.”
