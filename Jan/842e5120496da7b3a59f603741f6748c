THE community heard screams and saw dark smoke rising into the sky. When they went to investigate, they were horrified by what they found. Residents of Eersterust, Tshwane, found the burnt body of a man.

He said the suspects were still at large. “The victim’s identity is not known at the moment and we urge anyone looking for a family member or with information about the suspects to call Temba police on 012 717 9000,” he said.
