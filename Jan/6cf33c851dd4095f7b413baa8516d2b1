RESIDENTS of Jameson Park in Nigel, Gauteng promised their march would be peaceful. They promised that no vehicle, school or even tyre would be burnt. And they kept their promise. But when they met Lesedi mayor Lerato Maloka, they made another promise. “Should you not take these demands seriously, we will come back, and when we do, we won’t be so nice,” said the residents. Marchers took to the streets yesterday morning demanding service delivery in their area. They marched peacefully for about 10km. Traffic came to a standstill on the busy Jacob Street leading to Heidelberg town from Nigel. The marchers included the youth and the elderly. The distance was very long, but they all persisted as they wanted to send a strong message to the mayor. Jameson Park committee chairman Calvin Mokotong told Daily Sun that their area was deserted. “Nothing happens in our area. There is no progress at all. “We don’t know whether we fall under Nigel or Lesedi. When we need a post office we are told to use the one in Nigel, but when we pay for services, we are sent to Heidelberg. We are confused,” he said. Calvin said they used to fall under the Ekurhuleni Municipality. “Things were good, but they decided to change us and put us under Lesedi Municipality. “That is when we started to experiencing problems.” Calvin said they struggled with electricity. “When it’s raining, our electricity goes for days.” He said there was a primary school that had been without electricity for years. “It’s a struggle for our children. We want all that fixed,” he said. The residents said they wanted to be re-demarcated to Ekurhuleni. “We want to belong somewhere, maybe our lives will be easy,” said Calvin. Maloka accepted the memorandum and promised residents they would get back to them within the given time frame.
