ARTIST Noah Malatjie said the Limpopo Department of Arts and Culture failed to fulfil its promises. Noah, better known as Poet Noah, claimed the department owed him R7 000. The 31-year-old from Ga-Masha Village outside Burgersfort, Limpopo, told Daily Sun he was booked to perform at the Marula Fashion Extravaganza at Meropa Casino in 2017, but he hasn’t received a cent. “I had to make several calls to the department and I was always told to be patient.” Noah said as the department also booked accommodation for him at the casino, he never thought he’d be double crossed. “Every time I made follow-ups, I was told the money would be deposited into my account in a few days. Nothing has been deposited yet.” Noah said this was giving him sleepless nights and had affected his good spirits. He said he believed the relationship with the department would help him grow. “As artists, we want to grow, but being treated this way will prevent us from reaching our goals,” he said. Arts and Culture spokesman Malesela Ramaoka said the extravaganza was hosted by the department of economic development, environment and tourism. “The department was responsible for the event and the artists’ payments,” he said. “Our department’s availability during the extravaganza was only for support and nothing more.” He confirmed his department paid Noah for all their events he performed at. The economic development’s Marula Festival Committee chairman Moses Ngobeni denied the complaint and said the event was under arts and culture’s account and therefore his department owed no one.
