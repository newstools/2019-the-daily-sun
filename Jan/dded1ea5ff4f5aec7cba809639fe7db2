ACCORDING to the ANC, they are already preparing to govern AbaQulusi Municipality. ANC regional secretary Zakhele Buthelezi told the SunTeam this on Sunday. IFP councillors in the KZN municipality could find themselves sitting on opposition benches as the ANC has brought a motion of no confidence against speaker Mkhonyovu Khumalo. The ANC is confident of victory as IFP Councillor Khonza Thwala resigned last month. The vote is expected to take place at the council meeting in Vryheid today. Buthelezi said: “The IFP was in control because of support from the DA and the EFF. We are aware that their marriage is having problems.” IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa claimed the ANC had been trying to bribe IFP councillors. “We are not scared of the ANC and we will defend the motion. We will meet them on the streets in the by-election,” he said. “The media is aware that ANC leaders were arrested by the Hawks last year for trying to bribe DA councillors.” The IFP, DA and the EFF have 22 seats while the ANC has 21. Meanwhile, Buthelezi and two other party officials will appear in the Vryheid Magistrates Court tomorrow for allegedly trying to bribe a DA councillor last year.
