FRIENDS, family and musicians will gather tomorrow to say goodbye to disco star Dan Tshanda. A memorial service will be held at the Bassline in Newtown, Joburg, while the music great will be buried next Friday in Chiawelo, Soweto, his birthplace. This was revealed by the Tshanda family at a media briefing held at his home in Bryanston, Joburg, on Tuesday. Dan’s three sons were at the briefing and his eldest, Ndivhuwo (18), said he was a loving dad and no child could have asked for a better one. “He was our role model. He built us up and always told us we could accomplish anything we put our minds to. “He told us about all the wrong things to avoid in life. He made us good kids.” Ndivhuwo said he had just learned he had passed matric when he heard the news that his dad had died. Dan and his family enjoyed a holiday in Durban days before his untimely death. The 54-year-old died of heart failure on Saturday while on his way to hospital for a check-up. The artist left school at an early age to become a taxi driver. He started the music group The Flying Squad in 1985. The group later became Splash and released hit albums such as Peacock, Snake, Money and Tshokotshoko. The success of his music saw him collaborate with many legendary musicians and released more than 40 albums as a musician and producer. Dan, who was popular in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and the UK, leaves behind his wife Sylvia and three sons.
