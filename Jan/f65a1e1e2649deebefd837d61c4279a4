 THE teacher that is involved in the racial separation at Laerskool Schweizer-Reneke, has been suspended with immediate effect. Parents at the school at have removed their children from the school, they say their kids are not safe at the school. There was chaos as supporters of different organisations protestted outside the primary school in North West, after a picture of white children and blacks being separated made the rounds on social media. Parents reportedly used a 4x4 bakkie to break down the back of a fence to remove kids from the school. North West Education MEC Sello Lehari is at the school to address the parents at the school. It's reported that the teacher separated the children, allegedly because they are new to the school and they donâ€™t understand English and Afrikaans. Imagine removing your kids from a school because they're sharing the same environment as kids from another race. The sense of entitlement here is nauseating. Sies! #SchweizerReneke
