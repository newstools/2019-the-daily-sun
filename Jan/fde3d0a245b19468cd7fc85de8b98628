Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp has revealed the extent of goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune’s injury. The goalkeeper underwent surgery on his injured shoulder and is set to miss up to six months of action, Middendorp revealed. The coach had already confirmed that Khune would not play again this season, and now it looks like the keeper will miss more action than was initially anticipated. While he was always going to miss Bafana Bafana’s final AFCON qualifier against Libya in March, it now seems like he might go on to miss the tournament should Bafana Bafana qualify. "Itumeleng Khune underwent shoulder surgery and should return in six months. Mulomowandau Mathoho is recovering from an ankle injury,” Middendorp told the club’s website. The German coach shared some rare positive injury updates for the injury ridden Glamour Boys. Defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele and midfielder Joseph Malongoane are recovering well after their respective injuries. "The good news is that 'Tower' is out of plaster, is now using a moon booth and started some physiotherapy workout. Philani Zulu is recovering from a facial fracture, but he will still be out for three weeks,” he added.
