ATTORNEY Anton Ramaano treated traditional leaders to a fun day this weekend. The leaders from Venda in Limpopo included Chief Gole Mphaphuli, Prince Gulukhulu Mathebula and Chief Vele Kutama. The outing to the launch of the Rewards Dam Resort in Vhembe, owned by Ramaano, was attended by former traditional affairs minister Richard Baloyi. Chiefs were entertained by traditional dancers at the resort, which has wild animals and beautifully landscaped gardens. Last month Ramaano hired a bus and took traditional leaders on a tour of Mapungubwe. At the function Ramaano said he was a humble man who respected traditional leaders. “They are always coming up with ideas for development and making life easier for subjects. “We felt as the year has drawn to a close, we should give them a little rest. Let us humble ourselves before them and give them the respect they deserve.” Acting Vhembe mayor Thina Mbedzi congratulated Ramaano for opening the resort. Mphaphuli praised him for creating jobs, while Mathebula praised him for uniting traditional leaders. “Things used to be like this before we were divided. With Ramaano backing us, we are moving back there,” Mathebula said.
