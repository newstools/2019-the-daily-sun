POLICE are on the hunt for the parents of a two-year-old girl whose skull was fractured. The child, known as Mazi, is currently fighting for her life at Dora Nginza Hospital in Port Elizabeth after being admitted with a serious head injury. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge told Daily Sun the girl was dropped off at Motherwell Health Centre by an unknown woman at about 11am last Monday. The woman refused to give her name and would only say the child was called Mazi. Staff at the clinic immediately had the girl transferred to hospital. “She is currently still there on life support equipment. It is not clear yet what caused the wounds, but we have a strong belief that she was assaulted. “This will be part of our investigation,” said Beetge. “Police will be investigating a case of attempted murder. “A hospital social worker notified the police of the incident on Thursday, as no one came forward looking for the child after she was dropped off.” The police appealed to the community to help them solve the case. Beetge said: “Any person with information that might be able to assist the police can contact detective Captain Michael Shannagen on 082 779 7292.” Provincial health department spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said the child was in a very critical condition. “She had numerous injuries, including a skull fracture and bleeding on the brain.”
