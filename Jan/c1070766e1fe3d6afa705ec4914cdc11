SHE wanted to teach the other woman a lesson for messing around with her man – but it looks as if she might learn a tough lesson herself. Koketso Mogoshi, who allegedly humiliated a woman in a video, appeared in the Odi Magistrates Court in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, yesterday. A woman’s voice can be heard on the video forcing Lerato Rahlogo to strip naked and wash blankets, allegedly for sleeping with her man. Lerato said Koketso called her on Sunday and said she wanted to meet her. She apparently vowed not to hurt her as she just wanted to talk. “She told me we were going to her man’s place,” said Lerato. “When I refused she threatened to hit me over the head with a spade that she was carrying. She said she would leave me to bleed.” When they arrived, Koketso told her boyfriend Pule Mosenye to fill a bucket with water so Lerato could wash the blankets. “I tried to run away but she caught me. She slapped me in the face before telling me to strip naked and wash their blankets. “I begged Pule to help me but he refused and left me with Koketso.” Lerato said Koketso was not the wife but just a girlfriend. She laid charges against Koketso, who was granted R1 000 bail. The case was postponed to next Thursday. Tlhalefeng Khoza, one of the women who came to court in support of Lerato, said Koketso deserved a harsh punishment for what she did. Odi police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola confirmed Koketso was facing an assault charge.
