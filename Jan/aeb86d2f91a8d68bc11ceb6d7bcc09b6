Angry residents gathered to burn Bushiri's Church at the PTA Showgrounds yesterday. This follows after the 3 deaths that occurred during a stampede at Prophet Shepherd Bushiri's Enlightened Christian Gathering Church in Pretoria. According to IOL several ECG members camped outside the venue fled as the protesters descended on the venue.  Some of the protesters accused the members who queue for days outside the venue of relieving themselves in the open. "We live in this area, and the whole place has been turned into a huge toilet. Bushiri is fast asleep in a comfortable house while his people are peeing on our fences. They must just go to hell," said a protester who only identified himself as Buti. Sanco deputy chair Kabelo Tladinyane said the residents would not allow the ECG congregants to gather from now on. "We will be here, burning more tyres. They will not be using our venue anymore," said Tladinyane. "We received a call with a claim that there were about 12 people that got injured. We dispatched three ambulances, but upon arrival, the ambulances found that there was one patient with moderate injuries. The patient was treated on [the] scene and then transported to Kalafong Hospital by Tshwane emergency services. That is the only patient that we transported. We are not sure if other patients were transported privately by private people," Mabaso said.
