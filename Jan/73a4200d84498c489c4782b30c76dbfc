Rapper, K.O is still feeling the brunt of the downfall of his beloved record label, Cashtime Fam. K.O, whose real name is Ntokozo Mdluli, ditched his label in 2017 to sign with Sony Music Entertainment Africa. Since Cashtime was already a sinking ship then, it soon had no choice but to shut down. Since then its founder, K.O has been through a tough time in his professional and personal life. ICYMI: K.O IS OK! The legendary rapper has had to stare at failure in the face and come to terms with what it means for the label to shut down.
