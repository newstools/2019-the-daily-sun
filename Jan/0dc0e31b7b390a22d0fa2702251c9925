DA Western Cape premier candidate Alan Winde promised that the party would rise above its challenges. Winde said he is confident the damage caused by the long battle between former Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille and the DA is all in the past. “We are moving towards the elections. “Whatever record you want to put in front of anybody, we govern way better than the ANC,” he said. Yesterday Winde unveiled the party’s voter registration poster in Mitchells Plain. “We need to make sure we get people registered. “We all see the ANC is very enthusiastic to take Western Cape away from us.” He urged all South Africans who have not registered to do so on 26 and 27 January. “If you are not registered to vote, you cannot exercise your democratic right.” Meanwhile, party leader Mmusi Maimane and Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga unveiled a registration poster at Baragwanath Taxi Rank in Soweto.
