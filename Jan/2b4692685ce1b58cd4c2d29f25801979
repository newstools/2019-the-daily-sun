NOMHLE Madinga from Delft, Cape Town, is disappointed in the police. The 48-year-old told the People’s Paper she hoped police would help her bury her son Sizwe Madinga (28), who was a state witness. He was shot on 7 January, while working home from work. “I hoped police would help me bury him since they failed to keep their promise while he was still alive. “If we’d known cops weren’t going to keep their word, I wouldn’t have allowed him to be a state witness.” Nomhle said she was hurt by the way the police handled her son’s death. She said she was still waiting to hear from them. “They were supposed to come to me.” Sizwe will be buried in Mount Fletcher, Eastern Cape, next Saturday. His body was transported to the Eastern Cape on Tuesday, but first it was taken to the spot where he died so his spirit could be fetched. Daily Sun published a story about Sizwe’s death on 9 January with the headline, “Killers in jail”. Nomhle said before Sizwe agreed to be a state witness, she asked police to protect her son.“I made the request because we all know state witnesses are killed if there is no police protection. “I’m still afraid because maybe his killers will send someone to murder me.”
