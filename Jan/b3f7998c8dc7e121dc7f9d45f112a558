POLICE were sitting in their office minding their business when a thug suddenly came falling from the ceiling. The 29-year-old had apparently broken in through the roof of Mayfield Mall in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, to steal from a shop but he ended up in the satellite police station used by Putfontein cops! Police spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube said they believed the thug thought he would be jumping into a shop when he removed zinc from the ceiling on Tuesday evening. “But to his shock, he jumped right into the room being used by the police,” he said. Ramaube said the man was arrested on the spot and charged with attempted robbery. He said the police were given an office at the mall because there had been a number of break-ins and robberies at shops. “We suspect he was one of the residents protesting near the mall earlier. He saw many shops were closed to prevent looting,” said Ramaube. “He tried to sneak in but was caught hiding inside the mall by security guards twice and was chased away.” However, he later returned. “But his plan didn’t work out as he found himself surrounded by cops,” said Ramaube. He said a case of attempted robbery was opened. The suspect will appear in the Daveyton Magistrates Court today.
