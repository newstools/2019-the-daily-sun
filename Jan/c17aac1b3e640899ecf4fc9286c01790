SHE was out jogging when she passed a shocking crash that
had recently happened. Jacqui Saunders (50) stopped to help wave traffic around
the accident scene. Then she decided to give her hubby a call. "I thought I should ring him to say you’ve had a
lucky escape, only to find he hadn’t, it was him," she told Derbyshire
Live. John Saunders (47) died on 17 December last year in
Denby, in the north of England when his moped crashed into a Range Rover. Jacqui and John had been married for 26 years and had
eight kids together. She and her kids spoke to the Sun about losing John just
days before Christmas, with presents already piling up under the tree. Daughter Kirsty Saunders added: "He always texted me
on a Friday night saying 'Good night, God bless you' so that's my last message
from him." "He'd always give me a hug when I came in. It's
those moments I miss the most." Eldest daughter Anna (33) got married shortly before her
dad was killed. "After a long engagement, I'm glad that we finally
had the wedding, so that Dad has been able to see one of his children get
married.” Jacqui remembers: "We could talk for hours and never
ran out of things to say. Life wasn’t perfect but at the moment the good
outweighs any of the bad.” Despite the horror of their loss, Jacqui is amazed at the
support the whole family is receiving. "Everyone has rallied round and supported each and
every one of us and still continue to do so. We can't thank them enough. "We are supporting each other as a family and he'd
be so proud to know we've come together. We miss him terribly and he didn't
deserve this tragic ending." An inquest into the cause of John's death is currently
underway.
