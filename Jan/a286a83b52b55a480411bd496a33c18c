THEY saw a piece of land and decided to grab it. Allegedly led by the EFF, residents started erecting shacks in Barcelona extension 26, near Etwatwa, on Sunday morning. However, things turned violent when the Ekurhuleni Metro cops arrived on the scene and told them to leave. Furious residents confronted the cops and one person died. Three were injured. Stephen Kau (24), an EFF member, was shot in the eye and body. He died at the scene. Lerato Mokoena, one of the EFF leaders, claims a cop shot at Stephens using live rounds. “We never attacked them,” she said. His mum, Christina, appealed to SunReaders for help to bury her son. A resident said: “We are angry with cops for using so much force. That piece of land doesn’t belong to anyone and that is why we had to take it.” Nomvula Zwane (40) said she was shot in the back, while Dineo Matsunyane (30) said she was hit in the leg by a stray rubber bullet when she stopped to see what was going on. Dineo said: “I was not one of the people who grabbed the land but I ended up paying for something I was not involved in.” Residents said they decided to take action because they have been on waiting lists for RDPs for many years. Metro police spokesman Kobeli Mokheseng said cops didn’t use live rounds. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini said they were investigating.
