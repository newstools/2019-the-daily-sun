A NINE-year-old boy is fighting for his life in hospital after being shot in the back. The boy was at a service delivery protest on Saturday when he was shot, apparently by a motorist. Residents of White City, Soweto, barricaded the road with burning tyres and stones because of a lack of services and power cuts. A number of kids were standing on the side of the closed road when a man driving a white VW Polo Vivo arrived and refused to turn around. Instead, he pulled out a gun and fired shots, sending children running for their lives. The victim was hit in the back near his spine. The boy was rushed to a local clinic and transferred to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. His 38-year-old mum, who was recovering from a stroke, said she almost had another one when she heard what had happened. “I knew my kids were outside but I had no idea they had gone to the protest,” she said. Community leader Xolani Madiba said he witnessed the incident. “He could have killed a lot of people. He needs to be arrested,” he said. Moroka police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza told Daily Sun a case of attempted murder was opened. “We ask anyone with information to come forward,” he said.
