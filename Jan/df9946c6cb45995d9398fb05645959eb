WHILE registration at Unisa campuses began yesterday, the institution issued a warning to its Durban students. This comes after the university was made aware of an advert circulating on social media where Lorekom International Internet Cafe persuades Unisa students to visit the cafe for their online registration. Unisa spokesman Martin Ramotshela said: Lorekom International café has used the university’s logo in their ad and this gives a false impression that they are endorsed by the university.“We distance ourselves from this ad and strongly condemn the usage of our logo without permission. “As Unisa, all our services to students are offered either online through the university’s website or at Unisa’s service centre within campuses,” said Ramotshela. Daily Sun has learnt that the advert started circulating on Facebook on 23 December and later spread to other social media platforms including Twitter. According to Ramotshela, Unisa has learnt that the cafe charges R60 per student to process online registrations. “The advert further state that they fetch students from anywhere they are and bring them to the internet café for registration transaction,” he said. Ramotshela urged all students to exercise caution before parting with money or getting into vehicles of strangers. He said students should only register on www.unisa.ac.za Lorekom International Internet Cafe responded via its Facebook page and said: “We have helped thousands of students. If you don’t know, check us out we’re at the heart of Durban.” Lorekom comment to follow…
