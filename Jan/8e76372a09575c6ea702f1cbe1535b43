POLICE Minister Bheki Cele recommitted himself to finding Senzo Meyiwa’s killer. During an appearance on Crime Watch on Wednesday, Cele said he was putting his head on the block. “The Senzo Meyiwa matter is going to be resolved by Easter,” he said. Cele’s spokeswoman Reneilwe Serero told Daily Sun the minister committed himself to solving the crime when he came into office. “The progress that is being made is promising and there should be an arrest before Easter.” National police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo told Daily Sun he could not comment. Multiple attempts to contact Senzo’s father Sam Mayiwa proved unsuccessful. Former Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Meyiwa was murdered in an alleged failed robbery in 2014. Police have yet to arrest a suspect in connection with the murder.
