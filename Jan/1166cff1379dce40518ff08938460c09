THE new year got off to a bad start for commuters and motorists, with some sustaining serious injuries in road accidents. Eleven people were rushed to various hospitals yesterday after a taxi crashed near Victory Park, north of Joburg. Meanwhile, 11 people were injured on Tuesday after a car collided with a bakkie on the N3 highway in Townhill, Pietermaritzburg. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said: “Paramedics found a bakkie and light motor vehicle in the slow and middle lane of the highway. Several people were found scattered between the lanes. “Eleven people sustained minor to moderate injuries. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or fatalities at the scene.” The carnage started towards the end of 2018. On Monday three people sustained minor injuries in a collision involving three vehicles. The accident took place on Ontdekkers Road in Roodepoort, west of Joburg.
