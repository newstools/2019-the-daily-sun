"There's no communication with him, (we) spoke to his manager but no luck. We wish him all the best on his career. "We are hoping whoever will take him will be able to save him. Football is [a] tough sport, [your] career can end in a split second." The 27-year-old was formerly on the books of Mamelodi Sundowns before joining United on a permanent deal. He has made 13 appearances for the team and scored one goal in those matches.
