A wanted suspect has been discharged from hospital after fleeing arrest since November. The thug wanted for crimes including attempted murder was arrested after being involved in an accident in a vehicle stolen last month. The accident occurred on 30 December in Mkhuhlu, in which two of his friends died. He escaped with minor injuries. Clearance Dlamini (28), from Merry Pebble Stream Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Monday for attempted murder. This charge was provisionally withdrawn for further police investigation. According to Mhala police spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane, once the investigation is complete, charges will be reinstated. He remains in police custody as he faces charges of hijacking which he allegedly committed in Hazyview.
