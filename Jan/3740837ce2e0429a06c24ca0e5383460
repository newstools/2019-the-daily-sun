BANYANA BANYANA coach Desiree Ellis says they will need to put more effort in finishing to ensure her girls are clinical during the Fifa World Cup. Banyana are preparing for the world showpiece scheduled to take place in France from 7 June to 7 July. Banyana kicked off their preparation on a poor note as they suffered a 2-1 defeat against Netherlands in the inaugural Winnie Mandela challenge at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. The International friendly was the first match for Banyana since December when they lost the Africa Women Cup of Nations to Nigeria in the final played in Ghana. Tomorrow (7pm), Desiree Ellis’s charges will continue with their preparations when they tackle Sweden in Albertina Sisulu Centenary Challenge at the same venue. “We always look at improved performance”, said Ellis. “Our movement needs to be better, that is one of the things we need to improve going to Tuesdays game. “We need to minimise our mistakes and be more clinical, especially when we play top teams as they don’t hesitate to punish you.” “When you play the likes of Lesotho and Botswana, with all due respect, you can get away with it. One of the other areas was set pieces during Afcon and now we have been really good at defending them. We have improved on that, but still panic a bit.” Ellis also confirmed that some of the players who were limping toward the end of the match on Saturday will be available for selection tomorrow. She added: “The players haven’t played a competitive match in two months, so they were cramping. We do not have any injuries at the moment.” The coach was also full of praise for 17-year-old Karabo Dlamini, who was given a run in the second half against Netherlands. “Karabo is a good and an intelligent player, she has all the qualities and is also versatile. She looked like a seasoned campaigner. That’s good because when you go to the World Cup with a squad of 23 players you need to have players who can play in different positions.”
