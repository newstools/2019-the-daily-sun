DJ BIG BOY has a winning formula! Well-known on radio, Biggy, whose real name is Onalerona Dingoko has once again won the Best Radio Show Award at the South African Hip Hop Awards that took place last month at the Lyric Theatre in Gold Reef City, south of Joburg. This is his second win. He won in the King of North West category of the same Hip Hop awards in 2017. The 37-year-old from Mohlabeng Village in Mahikeng, North West, is the host of Motswako wa Hip Hop show on Motsweding FM. The show is on air every Friday between 8pm and 10pm and on Saturdays between 9pm and midnight. His target audience is the youth. The show has a 30-minute feature that focuses on both up-and-coming and prominent hip hop artists. “We give them a platform to showcase their talent and sell themselves to producers and the public,” said Big Boy. “We also give them advice on how to submit their mix tapes to music compilers. For example a song must be registered with Samro before it can get airplay.” Biggy joined Motsweding in 2011 and was introduced to listeners by the late HHP. “He welcomed me and said here we speak Tswanglish and I must not be afraid,” said Biggy. “I was nervous as it was my first radio job on a national radio station. I wished he could co-present with me since he knew how to ease my nerves.” Biggy said he did justice to the show and listeners liked him. “Some of them were my fans from Mafikeng FM, a community radio station where I was doing afternoon drive show and Saturday breakfast,” he said. This year marks 20 years for DJ Big Boy on radio. He was inspired by his aunt Tsabanyana, who listened to reggae and pop. “During school holidays I practised how to be a DJ using my cousin’s DJ mini booth. My parents didn’t accept my musical path and wouldn’t allow me to deejay. But I’m glad I pursued music,” he said. He said his parents were proud of him because music instilled discipline in him. “It gave me direction in life.”
