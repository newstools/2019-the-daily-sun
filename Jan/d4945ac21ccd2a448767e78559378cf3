The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has denied making
any payments to the late Fezekile "Khwezi" Kuzwayo. Kuzwayo accused former president Jacob Zuma of rape. This was according to a BusinessDay report on Friday which
stated that the NPA said Kuzwayo had been "protected and housed" by
the police in a safe house after she accused the former president in 2005. Zuma was acquitted of the rape in May 2006. Kuzwayo died on
October 7, 2016. In October last year, Zuma's legal team requested
information on whether the NPA paid Kuzwayo. The request was in support of his legal team's application for
a permanent stay of his prosecution for corruption, News24 reported. Zuma faces charges of fraud, racketeering, corruption, money
laundering and tax evasion, dating back to the infamous arms deal in the late
1990s. Zuma stated in court papers that he believed the trial was
an attempt to tarnish his name, and claimed the prosecution was biased, News24
reported. According to the BusinessDay report, a letter dated January
7 which was sent to Zuma's lawyers, stated that the NPA had been unable to
obtain any form of payments from November 2005 to August 2008 to Khwezi. The publication further reported that in its response, the
NPA further handed over the "materials relating to the income tax offences"
Zuma had been charged with. The tax charges relate to his alleged failure to submit tax
returns from 1995 to 2003 and declare income of R2.7m, as well as the alleged
evasion of R1.6m in taxes. Zuma's corruption trial will resume again on May 20 in the
KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg. In November last year, Judge Mjabuliseni Madondo ordered
that the permanent stay of prosecution arguments and the criminal proceedings
be heard on that day. SOURCE: NEWS24
