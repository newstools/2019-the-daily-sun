MINISTER of Environmental Affairs Nomvula Mokonyane has vowed to upgrade the Mandosi Combine School. The minister visited the school in Ndwedwe, north of Durban in KZN, yesterday. She was accompanied by eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and KZN education head Enock Nzama. She said her department had adopted the school and would improve its infrastructure. Mokonyane also donated desks and 15 000 sanitary pads to the girls of the school. Envirosan, a company which builds septic toilets mostly in rural areas, donated two flushable toilets. Human settlements portfolio committee chairwoman Nocawe Mafu promised to build a science lab at the school. President Cyril Ramaphosa and Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana were expected to visit but they cancelled at the last minute due to other commitments. Nzama announced his department had decided to build a new high school so Mandosi, which currently starts from grade R to matric, could be a primary school. He was there to launch the school safety programme. The school was chosen after it was in the news last year for all the wrong reasons. In August Daily Sun reported about a stabbing incident at the school which left two pupils dead. This resulted in disruptions and the school only obtaining a 31, 32 % in matric pass rate. Mkongi asked pupils to make a pledge to maintain peace at the school throughout the year. “I’ve heard a lot about the problems of this school. “So as a cop it’s my duty to come and tell you that school is not a place to carry weapons, but a place where we bring pens and books to learn. It’s not a war zone,” said Mkongi. “I promise all of you that if you are found carrying a weapon, we will deal with you. No one should disturb the peace in the school.”
