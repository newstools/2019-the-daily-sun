THE National Union of Mineworkers has blamed a team tasked with saving two mines for workers not receiving their pay. Regional secretary Tshilidzi Mathavha said the decision to allow Project Halo to take over the Optimum and Kroonfontein mines in Mpumalanga had led to disaster as the company did not have the funds to run the businesses. Project Halo, a local company, won the bid to take over the mines, which were previously owned by Gupta-linked company Tegeta. “It is sad and painful that NUM members and other workers had to have a bleak Christmas without being paid. “Employees will be going the third month without being paid as the business rescue practitioners unlawfully instructed them not to go to work.” Mathavha warned workers to be careful of parties who used their struggle to score political points. “We are calling on our members not to be misled by those who want to hijack their struggle.”
