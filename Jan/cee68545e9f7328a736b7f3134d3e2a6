THERE are already over 285 political parties registered in Mzansi and the Independent Electoral Commission is still processing another 37! Commission CEO Sy Mamabolo briefed the media on their state of readiness for this year’s elections. He said they have created a TV advert and campaign aimed at getting young people to register to vote. They have also designed a logo to appeal to the youth. Mamabolo said that while there were over 285 registered parties, it doesn’t mean the ballot papers will contain 200 parties. “If that were to happen, I would run away,” he said. “Registration and contesting the election is not the same thin. National parties need to pay a deposit of R200 000 and provincial parties must pay R40 000. “The deposits are returned to the party that obtains a seat. Those who don’t forfeit deposits, which go into state coffers.” Mamabolo said they have requested and trained about 60 000 officials, who will be on duty during the voter registration weekend, as well as the elections in May. “The commission is hoping to get 18 and 19-year-olds to participate in the election. “Registration of this age group is currently at 16%.” Addresses have also been also been prioritised, as ordered by the Constitutional Court. “Currently there are 1,6 million people without addresses on the roll.” He said they are working on the issue of addresses. Mamabolo said President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to announce the election date before the registration weekend on 26 and 27 January.
