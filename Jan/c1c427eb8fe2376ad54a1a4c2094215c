THE cops and residents are still shocked after a body with missing parts was discovered. The body was found without both legs and both arms at the Kameeldrift river in Kameeldrift, Tshwane, on Friday. Police spokesman Captain Michael Mbewe told Daily Sun they didn’t know what happened to the missing parts. “The body was badly decomposed and we couldn’t tell whether it was a man or woman, although we found a black bra and blue jeans at the scene,” Mbewe told the People’s Paper. Mbewe said the body was discovered by an employee of the extended public works programme who was working in the area. “The worker immediately alerted the police,” Mbewe said. “An inquest docket has been opened and investigations are underway.” Anyone with information should call Kameeldrift Police Station on the number 012 819 8200/8232 or alternatively, on 08600 10111.
