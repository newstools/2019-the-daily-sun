THERE is no single recipe for fun! Fun can be planned like a holiday but it can also arrange itself when the right people come together. And the women of Bo Gogo Women’s Club from Pimville in Soweto know how to make fun together. One day at the end of every year, the 16 members visit a park, lodge or enjoy a swim together. Chairwoman Nono Sinosi said that if they don’t braai meat with a few drinks, they eat at fine restaurants. “We also dedicate one special day in the year just for our entertainment.” The seed of Bo Gogo was planted at a neighbourhood Pimville zone 3 tavern where they met and formed friendships around a few drinks. But they wanted more from their circle so they created the stokvel five years ago. Once a month they have a meeting where each member pays R600. The money is given to a selected member. They also gather when one of them has a celebration or party such as a birthday – even if it’s a children’s party. Vice-chairwoman Kate Sehole said when they throw parties, they hope other women will try something similar with their friends. Member Thembi Ntoahae said that they also save an extra amount of money for their year-end entertainment. “We visited uShaka Marine World in Durban last year. “We believe in having fun now otherwise we are only ever depriving ourselves of good times no one else can provide.”
