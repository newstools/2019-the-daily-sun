Former Maritzburg United head coach Fadlu Davids has joined the Orlando Pirates technical team as an assistant to head coach Milutin Sredojevic and Rhulani Mokwena. The Buccaneers confirmed the signing of Davids, who was sacked at The Team of Choice just three weeks ago, on Tuesday morning on the club website. "After going five months without filling the vacancy left by Benson Mhlongo, the Buccaneers have now appointed Davids after he recently departed the Team of Choice. The 37-year old will complete a talented technical team that already boasts Sredojevic and assistant coach Rhulani Mokwena. Speaking on this appointment, club chairperson Irvin Khoza said: "I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Mr Davids to Orlando Pirates." "What was gratifying when I introduced the coach to the technical team there was an instant cordiality and rapport between them. "It is also quite exciting to have two emerging talents in Rhulani and Fadlu complementing each other." Davids will officially commence his duties from Tuesday, 15 January.
