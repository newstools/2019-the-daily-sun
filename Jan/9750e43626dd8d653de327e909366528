TWO thugs were arrested on Friday after they robbed a high school in Winterveld, north of Tshwane. Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said officers received a tip-off about two people carrying laptops. “The police went to their house and the two confessed that they had stolen from the school,” he said. Sebola said the two also confessed to stealing the principal’s car. A case of business robbery was opened. The suspects will appear in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court soon.
