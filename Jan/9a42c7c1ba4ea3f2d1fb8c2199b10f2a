BY the time he makes his next court appearance, Pitch Black Afro will have spent a month in prison. The rapper whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo was arrested earlier this month for allegedly murdering his wife, Tricia Modisane. His usual jolly self, Pitch BlackAfro entered the Joburg Magistrates Court on Friday, greeting everyone. The case was again postponed, this time to Wednesday. The rapper was previously ordered to give DNA samples. The musician’s bail has been delayed for the past two weeks because the state had to confirm the address where he would be living. Daily Sun previously reported that the Ntofo, Ntofo hitmaker allegedly beat his wife to death on New Year’s Eve at a bed and breakfast in Joburg. She had visible injuries on the upper body. Soon after his case was postponed, the rapper shouted and waved to his mother, who was seated in the packed gallery, and said: “Mamzo, one more week.” He was then led to the holding cells.
