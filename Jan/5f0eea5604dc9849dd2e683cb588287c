RISING star Manqonqo is ready to release more hits. The singer made his name last year after his hit song Eyadini, which features Dason and Saviour Gee, set the streets on fire. It was also the first runner up for the SABC song of the year 2018 contest, after Prince Kaybee’s Banomoya. The 21-year-old, whose real name is Mlungisi Buthelezi,  told SunBuzz he was now gearing up for the release of his debut 7-track EP titled Naoke Leonto next month. He said he was excited about it as people had been asking him to release more songs. “They have been begging me for more and some have been asking if I was just a one-hit wonder. “This EP is for the people. It’s also going to show them I’m in this to conquer it,” he said. Manqonqo, who’s from Folweni, south of Durban in KZN, started singing in 2014 while at high school. He told SunBuzz: “I loved music from a very young age but there weren’t any studios around my village. “In high school I met DJ Airic (Mlungisi Ngubane), who was known for producing beats. “I decided to grab the opportunity and ask him to produce beats for me and I’ve never looked back.” Manqonqo said Airic had been producing songs for him since 2014 and he even made Eyadini. “We didn’t expect this song to be this big but I am happy with the outcome,” he said.
