DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane and other party leaders marched through Joburg yesterday to unveil a billboard in the CBD. However, when he was asked to comment on the high levels of violence in the DA-run Western Cape, Maimane’s response was not clear. “Murder in this country is far too high. People are being killed everywhere,” he said. Maimane said the ANC must account for all crimes happening nationally. “Nationally, the ANC run the police. Whether it’s a child in Nyanga, whether it’s in Soweto, whether it’s farm murders in North West, the police must work hard,” he said. “We don’t want our people to be killed. This ANC government must account. We are sick and tired of our people’s lives being taken without a government that responds. Today, we reflect on the lives of those who have died and we say, never again. Wherever we are in government, we will continue to fight for honest police to fight for the people.” Maimane was then asked about ANC NEC member Zizi Kodwa’s tweet, in which he claimed the DA was using ANC’s name to campaign. “Everything Mmusi says is about the ANC. He can’t finish a sentence without mentioning the ANC,” Kodwa wrote. Maimane at first said: “I don’t respond to Zizi Kodwa.” When he was pressed to say more, he responded: “Kodwa must explain why the ANC has murdered South Africans. If Zizi wants to be a spokesperson for people who kill our people, he must continue.”
