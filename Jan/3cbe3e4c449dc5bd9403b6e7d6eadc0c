A security guard was shot and injured
in the Johannesburg CBD, when he went to inspect an attempted business robbery at the corner of Pritchard and Mooi Street. The security guard was taken to the
hospital after being shot in the lower body and he has since been discharged. “The security guard, who suspected an
imminent business robbery, confronted the suspects." "In the process, several
shots were fired and the security guard was wounded." Several members of the public who
witnessed the incident are being interviewed to establish as to what had
transpired at the crime scene,” police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini
said. Dlamini said they appeal to the public
who may have more information to assist in the investigation to come forward. He made a plea to social media users to
allow police to investigate the incident, as visuals trending on social media
may be a potential source that may be used as evidence in court.
