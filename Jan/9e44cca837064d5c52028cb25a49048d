STATE witness Stanley Mnyakama wanted the men convicted of murdering Matlhomola Moshoeu to receive the death penalty. Mnyakama was speaking at the North West High Court in Mahikeng on Thursday. The court last year found Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte guilty of murder. Mnyakama said: “The accused can still see their families. “But Matlhomola’s family will never speak to him again.” He said life in his kasi had not returned to normal as the community was waiting for the finalisation of the case. The defence is expected to make their closing arguments before Judge Ronald Hendricks can pass sentence. Before proceedings resumed yesterday, a group wearing EFF T-shirts tried to forcefully sit among the white people in the court. The group verbally attacked and confronted Susan Cilliers, a Netwerk24 journalist, when she took photographs. Security guards and police had to be called to calm tensions. The case is expected to end on Friday.
