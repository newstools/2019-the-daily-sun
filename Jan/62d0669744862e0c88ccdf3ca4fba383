A COP was injured and two police cars were damaged on Saturday when a group of residents attacked police who were raiding a suspected drug den. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the Umlazi K9 unit and other units went in two cars to raid a home in Table Mountain Road in Chatsworth. “When the cops got there, a group of 200 aggressive residents started attacking police with stones and bricks, resulting in the injury of a police member as well as two damaged vehicles,” said Mbele. “Two suspects aged 25 and 30 were arrested and cases of public violence, malicious damage to property, assault, and possession of an unlicensed firearm were opened at Chats-worth cop shop.” She said the suspects were expected to appear in court soon. According to a source, the targeted home belonged to a well-known drug kingpin. “It has been the subject of many police raids. In 2016 the owner was bust after he was allegedly found in possession of about R1,8m worth of drugs and firearms including a Beretta pistol and a home-made gun. “It was also reported that R5 million worth of drugs were found at his home during a police raid in January 2013.”
