OVER R2.6 million of the stolen money that went missing from
a cash-in-transit company in Louis Trichardt, has been recovered and two
suspects arrested. The first suspect was arrested at Ravele Riverside and his
accomplice was later arrested at Elim Mabedengwa in Watervaal. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said cops
dug at three different premises and produced positive results when cash was recovered buried in the yards. Some of the cash was found stashed in ice cream containers
and refuse bags. He said the suspects, who are employees of the CIT company
were responsible for collecting cash from various places and instead of making
deposits, they then took the money. One of the suspects had already bought a double cab bakkie,
the vehicle was also confiscated. The Provincial Commissioner of Police in Limpopo, Lieutenant
General Nneke Ledwaba lauded the team that led to the arrest of the suspects
and the recovery of the stolen cash. The suspects will appear in Louis Trichardt magistrate court
