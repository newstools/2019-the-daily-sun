METRO FM’s Lerato Kganyago and flamboyant former sports minister Fikile Mbalula were at logger heads on twitter over a question the radio jock asked. Lerato wrote: “My question would be about the industry I’m in, why are they nowhere to be found when we need their help with burning issues that affect us but when it’s time for rallies and manifestos we are at the top of their minds?! Or is it because they choose who they support & protect?” Mbalula, who is the ANC’s head of elections replied: “Artists and everyone come to our rallies and manifestos because they believe in us and we pay even those who support us for their performance because  its their profession”. Things soon got heated when Lerato hit back, saying she doesn’t like to be intimidated: “I don’t take kindly to intimidation and especially when I am asking a GENERIC question!,” she wrote. Not backing down, Mbaks responded: There's no intimidation am answering your question Do you feel intimidated and how?” Lerato wasn’t letting this go, she hit back and wrote: “You read without understanding and went on a defensive mode. My question was VERY generic, for ALL political parties, but you made it personal for some odd reason! If you had READ all my tweets before you have replied with an understanding”. I don’t take kindly to intimidation and especially when I am asking a GENERIC question! ??
