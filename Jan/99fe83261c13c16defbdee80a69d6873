FOOD Lover’s Market in Diepkloof, Soweto, has been closed after the backlash to the video of a rat eating food at the store that went viral recently. Company CEO Brian Coppin said it has been temporarily shut. He blamed the incident on the open space behind the shop, which has become a rodents’ paradise. A resident who lives near the shop told the SunTeam the empty space is home to a large number of rats and mice. Coppins said standards at the store were not up to scratch. “When a store falls short of our standards, we work with them to put in place immediate action and hold regular follow-up audits. “Clearly, our standards haven’t been maintained at the store and for that reason, we apologise to all our loyal customers. “Having seen the recent video and heard the public response, the board has instructed the owner to temporarily close the store.” He said specialists would visit the store to do a deep clean to ensure it’s hygienic when it reopens in about a week’s time. “This will ensure it’s up to the normal standard and ready to operate at the level we demand.” Coppins said the shop would be revamped.
