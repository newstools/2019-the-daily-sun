WARRING International Pentecostal Holiness Church members appeared in Mokerong Magistrates Court in Limpopo yesterday. This comes after chaos on Saturday in Danisani Village near Mokopane, when fighting led to four members being sent to hospital. Those who were arrested and released on a warning on Sunday appeared in court yesterday. Apparently, a faction led by bishop Jacob Modise was about to start a service when Mike Siyandlana’s rival group chased them away. Church members later went on the rampage. People were assaulted and vehicles were damaged. Cops found over 20 petrol bombs, four big sticks and a knife. Church member Thomas Mochoeneng claimed police bust the wrong people. He said members of his group were victimised by the other faction, which broke away from the church three years ago. He said the other group carrying guns chased them away. “We ran for our lives as they were shooting at us but cops arrested our people.” The case was postponed as 11 of the 23 suspects are minors and only two were questioned. Some will appear again on Friday and others on 28 February.
