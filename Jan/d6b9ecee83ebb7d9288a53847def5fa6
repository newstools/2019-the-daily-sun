IT’S been a month since Neo Mochelana disappeared from home. The 18-year-old disappeared from Vista Park, Bloemfontein, on 10 December. Neo’s gogo Matebello Mawele (53) said she couldn’t sleep since she found a note from Neo saying she was leaving and she didn’t want to be found. “This is not the first time she’s left home. She once left home for a year and was found living with a boyfriend in Virginia,” said Matebello. “I last saw her on 10 December. She didn’t look okay. When I asked if she had a problem, she told me not to worry because she was fine. “I want her to come back home. She was going into grade 10 this year and is missing out on her education.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlobi said Neo was wearing black jeans and a black shirt. “A missing person report was registered at Mangaung Police Station. Anyone with information should call investigating officer Detective Mbulelo Kgoboko on 051 406 4477 or 082 527 6099.”
