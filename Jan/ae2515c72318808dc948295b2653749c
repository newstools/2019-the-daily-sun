RESIDENTS are living in fear of a hairy little man! Some of the children are even scared to talk about what they saw. But the residents of Magong Village near Rustenburg, North West are sure they saw a tokoloshe. They described it as half human and half animal. It had the face of an old man with a long beard, with short hands and human feet. The rest of the body had long hairs sweeping the ground and it was not wearing clothes. Those who saw it from behind said its neck turned all the way around. Resident Naome Mothisi (63) saw the monster from behind. A young man who saw the creature face to face has since fled the village. Lebogang Kgwefane (40) said her neighbour’s children called her as they were scared of a hairy creature. “The kids saw a curtain move repeatedly in one of the outside rooms and heard murmurs. They threw stones and the creature left the room. It didn’t run, but seemed like it was in a beauty contest. “It was not scared of people starring. The human head then turned, but the whole body continued going forward.” Lebogang found a broken window the next day.
