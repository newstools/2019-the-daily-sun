THE cattle farmer got the shock of his life. He went looking for his livestock at about 5pm on Wednesday, but the cows were nowhere to be found. He then called police and CPF members. Randfontein police spokeswoman, Constable Carmen Hendricks, told Daily Sun: “The man did his own investigations and noticed that the fence was cut and his herd of cattle (66) was missing.” Hendricks said the farmer also hired a private helicopter to search for his livestock. While searching from the air, he spotted his stock hidden in a temporary kraal between Westonaria and Venterspost. He also saw the suspect running through the veld. A 23-year-old male was arrested for stock theft near Vleikop in Randfontein, West Rand. “The police found live ammunition in his possession,” she said. Hendricks said the suspect was detained and will appear in the Randfontein Magistrates Court soon. “The complainant managed to identify all his stock and it was handed back to him,” she said. Randfontein station commander, Brigadier Mashole Manamela, advised farmers to brand their cattle. suggested that the public should have one or two emergency numbers of next of kin in case they need to be contacted if the owner can’t be reached. He also asked that employers must have documents for their livestock and that the cattle should be marked so that it can be easily identified.
