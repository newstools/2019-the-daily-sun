SINCE school opened on Wednesday at Solomon Mahlangu Primary School in Cornubia, Durban, a dog has bitten two pupils. The dog and its puppies were allegedly living underneath one of the park home classrooms. On Thursday afternoon, a seven-year-old grade one pupil was bitten. The pupil’s gogo (55) said her granddaughter arrived home bleeding and told her she was bitten by a dog at school. “I couldn’t understand how teachers allowed a dog into the school.” She said her granddaughter told her she went to pee behind a park home where the dog slept. “As she was peeing, it came out and bit her leg. She told me she tried to run away and the dog bit her foot and her shoe came off.” She said her granddaughter was rushed to a clinic. “Another pupil was bitten on the first day of school. The principal should call the SPCA to remove the dog. Our children are not safe. How can they learn under these conditions?” SGB deputy chairman Bhekisisa Buthelezi said they saw a dog was living underneath one of the park home classrooms before the schools opened. He said they tried to remove it but couldn’t. “The children were told not to play near the dog, because we were still trying to get hold of the SPCA to remove it. “But pupils didn’t listen and continued playing near it, resulting in two being bitten.” He said the SPCA removed the dog from the school on Friday.
