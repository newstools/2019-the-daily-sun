ON the 8th day of his testimony which is expected
to be his final day former Bosasa top boss Angelo Agrizzi said the company allegedly paid Dudu Myeni R300 000
per month. Agrizzi told the commission that Gavin Watson at some point asked
Agrizzi's wife for advice on how to impress Dudu Myeni. According to Agrizzi, his wife advised Watson that a Louis
Vuitton handbag would be good. He said following that, Watson put R300 000 in the bag and
gave it to Myeni which was allegedly for the Jacob Zuma Foundation. He further said he made a few payments to Myeni in the space
of a year, but he couldn’t remember the exact dates. Agrizzi also said Bosasa scored a tender worth
R20 million to upgrade an old Justice Department building. Following that Bosasa reportedly a paid politically connected
middleman Sesinyi Seopela R1.9 million as a 'facilitation fee'. Agrizzi said the monthly bribes that were between R4 and R6 million paid by the company were "tiny". He says they accounted for about 5% on the net profit of
Bosasa. Agrizzi says Myeni was very powerful in her proximity to the
president, and could influence decisions and swing deals in their favour.
