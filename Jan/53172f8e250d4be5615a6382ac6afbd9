YESTERDAY, organisations went to court to support a woman humiliated on social media. Lerato Rahlogo (29) became famous when a video went viral of her being forced to strip naked and wash blankets by Koketso Mogoshi (27). Koketso accused her of sleeping with the father of her kids. Women came to Odi Magistrate Court in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane to support Lerato and demand a sentence for Koketso. The ANC Youth League in Tshwane, EFF members and women from the Doek on Fleek project sang struggle songs and held placards outside the court. They said they hoped the punishment given to Koketso would set an example to all those who film people to humiliate them. Captain Samuel Sebola said Koketso faced charges of common assault and was granted R1 000 bail at this first court appearance. The case was postponed to 29 January for investigation.
