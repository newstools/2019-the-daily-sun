KYO brick works has been operating for years. But residents claimed no locals were employed at the mine, which they said preferred to hire foreigners. On Wednesday gatvol residents of Slovo in Springs, Ekurhuleni, blocked the road leading to the mine with burning tyres and rocks. They vowed business would not resume until they were hired. “The company prefers to use foreigners. On top of that, our houses have cracked due to blasting, but we are not being compensated,” said community leader Ali Malinga. “We have been trying to negotiate with the mine, but they are not taking us seriously.” On Monday Malinga said they went to the mine to hand over demands that the mine employ locals and invest in the community. “The people who are working at that mine are from outside Springs and yet our people are going hungry. Jan Keys, one of the mine’s managers, told the SunTeam the mine met the residents. “We had a two-hour meeting to iron out their issues,” he said. Keys couldn’t say what those issues were.
