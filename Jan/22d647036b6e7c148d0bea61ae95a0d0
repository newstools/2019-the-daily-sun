SOMETIMES it’s good to have an organisation focused on what’s good, not on misery. “We all come from different villages around Hammanskraal, Tshwane, such as Tloonane, Utsane, Cyverskuil and Olverton,” said Badirammogo Social Club chairman Jerry Lehau. “Back in 2013, seven friends become the first members of their own club. In the years since then the number has grown to a comfortable 21. “The main aim is to make sure we contribute cash to a member who is celebrating a birthday or getting married, graduating or unveiling a tombstone.” The club meets four times a year and the members contribute R100 or more to its savings account. If there is a reason to celebrate a member’s special day, Badirammogo provides the money for party expenses while members also bring two sixpacks of drinks and another R100 to help pay for the costs of such an event. But the club has a bigger goal in mind than just parties and events. The members meet every three months to pay their contributions but every time, a different member organises the meeting, which includes paying for meals and drinks out of their own pocket, at their usual meeting place. Lehau, who is also a school principal, said: “Parties are fun but only our short-term goal. Our long-term plan is to make sure each of our members can start and run their own businesses. We will encourage and support each member’s venture. “This is why we meet at the same venue – it is a member’s pub which is why we support it.” The members look forward to their next meeting in March.
