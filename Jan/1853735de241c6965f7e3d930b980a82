CELEBRITIES congratulated the class of 2018 and encouraged those who did not make it. “I encourage you to keep the same level of energy and concentration when you further your studies. “To those who didn’t make it, you can always rewrite. It’s not the end of the world. Failure gives you the opportunity to restart.” “To all those who need to do the year again, make it count and know this is an opportunity to improve your efforts. Wishing you everything of the best for 2019.” “You are entering another world with freedom but lots of responsibility. Remain focused and work even harder. “To those for whom things didn’t go their way, it’s not over. Failure is not the end of the world. Work harder in 2019!”
