On Thursday
night last week, a Ford Ranger bakkie drove into an Engen petrol station in
Tzaneen and filled R3000 diesel into empty containers. In the
video that has gone viral on social media, the petrol attendant can be seen
pouring fuel into the containers at the back of the bakkie. When the
attendant is done filling the containers, and goes to collect the speed point
machine, the bakkie driver speeds off. According
to police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe a case of theft was opened.
