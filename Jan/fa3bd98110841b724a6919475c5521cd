MARITZBURG United are set to announce Mabhuti Khenyeza as assistant to their new coach Muhsin Ertugral. The former Kaizer Chiefs striker said goodbye to his AmaZulu teammates on Sunday when they resumed training to prepare for the second round of Absa Premiership. On Wednesday night AmaZulu announced Khenyeza retirement The 36-year-old retires with more than 100 PSL goals in the bag and is set to join Team of Choice as Ertugral’s assistant. Khenyeza has been with Usuthu for two and half season, having joined them in 2016/17 season from Golden Arrows. Ertugral, who was appointed by Maritzburg boss Farouk Kadodia on Friday (28 December) to replace Fadlu Davids, doesn’t have an assistant as he was helped by Siyabonga Mdluli, the club’s MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach. This will be the second time Khenyeza work with Ertugral as he signed him while coaching Chiefs in 2007 from Golden Arrows. The 36 year-old striker hit the ground running as he won the Telkom Knockout during the same season, but the two had a burst up the following season which saw Khenyeza leave Amakhosi to join Ajax Cape Town. Their relationship was beyond repair as Khenyeza had revealed in 2009 that he will leave the Urban Warriors if management appoint Ertugral. But the two seems to have smoked a peace pipe in a bid to help Maritzburg move away from the bottom of Absa Premiership table. However, Kadodia was tight lipped about Khenyeza’s arrival. He said: “You must keep checking on my website and twitter account, it is where we will give all the information about that,’’ “I’m not giving you or anybody a story and this type of information.’’
