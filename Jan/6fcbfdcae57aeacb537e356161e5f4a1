WHERE did we go wrong? This is the question Mpumalanga Social Development MEC Busi Shiba asked at yesterday’s funeral of the four children who allegedly were murdered by their mother. Minenhle (8), Blessing (7), Shaniqua (4) and Ethen Maditla (11 months) were allegedly murdered by their 24-year-old mum, Zinhle Maditla on 26 December. On 30 December, Zinhle called relatives to her house in Klarinet, Emalahleni, where they were met by the gruesome scene of her four kids’ bodies wrapped in blankets. Speaking at the service at Emalahleni Civic Theatre yesterday, Shiba said: “The children were betrayed by the person who should have protected them.” She said the tragedy showed something was clearly wrong. “Our family value systems are degenerating. “This calls for the intervention of all people,” she said. “As custodians of social care and protection of the vulnerable, the department is shattered by the incident. We can’t understand why such gruesome incidents happen.” She encouraged residents to use their services to get help. Zinhle’s first court appearance was scheduled for last week, but she was only discharged from hospital on Friday and appeared in Witbank Magistrates Court on Monday. Her case was postponed to next Monday.
