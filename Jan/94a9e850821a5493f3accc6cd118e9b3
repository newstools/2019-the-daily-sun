LIHLE Ngaka (17) finds peace and joy by playing keyboards, and he is brilliant! Lihle, from Fochville near Carletonville, west of Joburg, masters melodies and uses interesting chords. He said he fell in love with keyboard playing last year after watching his friend Mthetho Mathenjwa (21) playing. “His sound was great and the melody as sweet as honey,” said Lihle. Lihle is a grade 12 pupil at Fochville High School, and he said he wanted to be a producer one day. “I want to be like American pianist and music producer Cory Henry,” he said. Lihle plays every Sunday at the Faith Mission Church. “I also enjoy when a singer sings a melody and we both lead a song. “I enjoy playing the keyboard behind the pastor’s teaching and prayer,” he said. “I learned how to play from internet tutorials. My first keyboard was bought for me by my mother, Ruth Ngaka for R3 000.” Lihle said he sang about his love for God and his mother. “This is the only love I know,” said the teenager. Lihle said when he’s on stage, he becomes free from all negative thoughts. “I’m free of any sadness. Perhaps that’s why some of my fans say I bless them with my playing,” he said. “This shows that my keyboard playing is going in the right direction.” Lihle likes the positive feedback. “It makes me feel happy and it shows growth,” he said. “I want to travel the world and bless as many people as I can.” He said his mother always reminded him that he must never stop believing, and those words are written on his keyboard. “My mother is my pillar of strength and my hope,” he said.
