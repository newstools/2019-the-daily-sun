WHEN Kabelo Makubetsa asked his mum to cook for him on Sunday, little did she know it would be the last time she would see him alive. The next day, the body of the 30-year-old was found in Bochabela kasi, Manguang. He had been shot and killed. His mum Meisie (59) told Daily Sun: “He asked me to cook him a Sunday meal before he went to church. The next day, I was woken by his friend who told me he was found dead. “When I saw his lifeless body lying in the street, I just felt sick. “I want the police to find his killer and lock them up. I want the killer to rot in jail,” she said. A resident said he heard people arguing at about 4am and then there were gunshots. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a case of murder was opened. “The police arrived on the scene to find the victim lying on the ground with a wound at the back of his neck. No suspect has been arrested. “We are asking anyone who might have witnessed the incident to contact investigating officer Constable Masabata Matiba on 082 465 6304.
