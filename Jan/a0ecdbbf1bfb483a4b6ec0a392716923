IF a fire breaks out, try not to panic! “Try to stay calm and put out the fire,” said Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi. Mulaudzi offered SunReaders easy ways to deal with different kinds of fires. “When dealing with indoor fires, these are minor situations where fires start due to electrical faults or burning of materials such as rubber, paper and so on,” he said. Mulaudzi said the best way to put out electrical fires is to use sand. “That is the best way to deal with these fires, unless one is lucky enough to have a fire extinguisher,” he said. He warned residents not to leave stoves and other fire hazards unattended. With electrical faults, water should never be used to put out those fires, as the electricity will react. In cases where raging fires are in squatter camps, people are advised to use buckets of water. Mulaudzi said creating a bucket brigade is the best way to put out those fires. “People in squatter camps use communal taps and in those cases, it’s best to line up people from the tap to the fire or burning shack. “One person pours water into empty buckets and people pass the buckets to the last man, who puts out the fire.” When using a fire extinguisher, pull out the pin, aim the nozzle at the bottom of the flames, squeeze the top of the extinguisher handle and swing the hose from side to side directly at the fire.
