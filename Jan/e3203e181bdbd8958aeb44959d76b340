FREE State Stars boss Rantsi Mokoena is not worried that Sinethemba Jantjie will leave the club at the end of the season. Absa Premiership leaders Bidvest Wits last week confirmed that they have signed the speedy winger on a pre-contract. He will join the Clever Boys on a four-year deal when his contract with Ea Lla Koto expires in July. The 29-year-old has been with Stars since 2016 when he joined the team from Mbombela United. Wits management have been trying to get Jantjie now, but the stumbling block seemed to be estimated R500 000 price tag Stars had put on his head for remainder of his contract. Jantjie is among the most important players for Ea Lla Koto as he also scored the winner when they defeated bottom side Maritzburg United 2-1 in the league last week. Stars have developed the habit of losing key players. The team also lost Nhlanhla Vilakazi to AmaZulu last season in a similar way. But Mokoena is not worried about losing their influential player. “This is nature of the game. Jantjie has served us for four years now and we understand that he’s (almost) 30 years old and we believed that he must go and make some money,’’ Mokoena told SunSport. Mokoena revealed that they tried their best to hold on to Jantjie without a success. “We offered him the best we could, but we couldn’t reach an agreement. There’s no doubt that it is a great loss for us. But as long as he continues to serve us well until he sees his contract through, I’ve got no problem.” Mokoena is not concerned that they keep losing their players for free. “Nhlanhla went for free and Moeketsi Sekola also went for free (to Highlands Park). But how many players have I signed for free? It is how the game rolls.’’
