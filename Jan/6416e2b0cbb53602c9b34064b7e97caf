Idols SA judge, Somizi Mhlongo might just have a future in comedy. If the choreography and realty TV fame fails him then a career in comedy could become a very lucrative business for SomGaga. His recent Miss Universe parody has had his Instagram followers in stitches. In the video, SomGaga is in a rode while he performs his skit to an unseen audience who are dying of laughter in the background. He goes on to thank the judges for “choosing” him as part of their top five. He continues to answer a question from the “judges”, leaving his audience in utter stitches. "Us playing Miss universe. Top 5. Do u think I can win it," he captioned the video. Watch the hilarious video below: Us playing Miss universe. Top 5. Do u think I can win it.
