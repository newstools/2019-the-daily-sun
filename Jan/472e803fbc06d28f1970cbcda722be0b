BONGANI Olayi (49) had a good heart. He was a humble man and a dedicated journalist. This is how Bongani was described by friends and relatives at his funeral in Ntabethemba Village, Bloemfontein, on Saturday. Bongani worked as a freelance journalist for Daily Sun for more than 10 years. He was working for Free State local newspapers at the time of his death. At his funeral, his young brother Mthuthuzeli said: “Bongani united the family, even when we had differences. He made sure there was peace, harmony and reconciliation among us. ” He said Bongani was very humble and respected his family and everyone else. “We lost a giant in our family and no one is going to fill his gap in our hearts. It’s hard to believe he is gone,” said Mthuthuzeli. “I’d like to thank the premier’s office, business people of Bloemfontein, journalists and those who contributed and ensured that my brother had a dignified burial.” Bongani is survived by his wife and two kids, his brother and three sisters.
