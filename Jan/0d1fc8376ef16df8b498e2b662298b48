THANKS to her cats and dogs, gogo Kholeka Ndinki is never lonely. The 61-year-old from Site C in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, told Daily Sun she has been unemployed for 20 years and her husband had left her. But she was helped through the hard times by her pets. “After my husband left, I started selling second-hand clothes to feed my three kids and my grandchild, but today my pets are the ones filling the space left behind by him.” Kholeka said although kasi residents liked dogs more than cats, they were very useful for keeping mice away. The gogo has 10 cats and four dogs living with her in her RDP. She said her pets kept evil away from her house and would scream if a tokoloshe came near. “My dogs are my everything. My favourite is called Spider. He makes my problems go away.”
