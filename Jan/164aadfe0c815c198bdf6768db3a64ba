THE Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) members marched to the Minerals Council of South Africa in Marshalltown on Tuesday. They handed over a memorandum to the Mineral Council of South Africa against the current wages of mineworkers in South Africa. AMCU’s President Joseph Mathunjwa said they will extend the one-day strike at Sibanye-Stillwater's platinum mine - if the company does not return to the negotiating table. “Comrades, go back respectively to your shifts tomorrow. Let's wait to hear from the Minerals Council. If nothing changes, we will get Lonmin and Impala to join this strike and cripple the economy until our needs are met,” Mathunjwa said.
