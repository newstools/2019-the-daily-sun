RAPPER AKA is known to be one the local celebrities who are not afraid to use their platform to address political issues. In a series of tweets that were triggered by DA tweet that showed the party unveiling a billboard in the CBD, the rapper revealed that he would be voting for the ANC in the upcoming 2019 elections. AKA, whose real name is Kiernan Forbes, is known for his pro-ANC stance. “Honestly, this election, I’m going to vote ANC. But I don’t know why,” AKA admitted, “I feel like many people feel that way. “I am ANC through and through but I need understanding and reassurance of what we stand for and where we are headed. Don’t be afraid to speak out, the ANC belongs to US. This is our ANC.” With the elections fast approaching, AKA encouraged people to register to vote and promised to find answers from the ANC leaders for those who still had reservations. “I am not an influencer nor am I contracted or paid in any shape or form by the ANC,” he added, “I have a platform as a leader in my private capacity as a citizen of the country that I love. I will speak as I see fit with my own beliefs and nobody can silence me or put a price on my voice.”
