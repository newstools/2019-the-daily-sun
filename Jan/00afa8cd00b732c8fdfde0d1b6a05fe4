PORTIA Masilo is ready to love again! She said she’s been lonely for far too long. The 40-year-old from Soshanguve block F, Tshwane, told Daily Sun she was looking for a real man. She said the man should be loving, good-mannered and have at least two children. “I promise to be Mrs Right if I find Mr Right,” she said. She said she had only been meeting men who took advantage of her. “I’m a loving person and when I commit to a man, I make sure he’s happy. But my exes never saw this in me,” she said. She said she and her husband were divorced. “My husband cheated on me and it affected me badly, but I’m fine now and ready to love,” she said. Portia said she wanted someone who was ready to marry her. “He must be honest, faithful, supportive and a good person. In return, I’ll reward him with lots of love.” Portia said she read about people getting wives in the paper and hoped her soulmate was out there. “I hope the People’s Paper will help me find the man of my dreams, who will be with me until death do us part,” she said. “No chance-takers or married men. I need a man who will take good care of me.”
