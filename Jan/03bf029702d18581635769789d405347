MAMELODI Sundowns have suffered a huge blow ahead of their Absa Premiership showdown against Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Downs coach Pitso Mosimane has a huge headache as five of his key players might miss the crucial clash due to injury. Those that are still nursing injuries in the casualty room are goalkeeper Denis Onyango, defender Ricardo Nascimento, midfielders Andile Jali, Aubrey Ngoma and Lucky Mohomi. Onyango has a knee injury and trained for only 30 minutes with the team yesterday. Bafana Bafana midfielder Jali is nursing a left foot injury, while Aubrey Ngoma started training with the rest of squad yesterday after being rested on Saturday as he was vomiting. Mohomi is nursing a foot injury while Nascimento is recovering from a left hip injury. Downs doctors are working around the clock with the technical staff to ensure all their best players are available for selection against the Soweto giants. Mosimane will be forced to reshuffle his defence if the Ugandan international keeper and Nascimento donâ€™t recover on time in order to deal with the danger posed by former teammates Khama Billiat and Leonardo Castro. The teams drew 1-1 in their last league encounter with Nascimento and Chiefs defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele finding the back of net. A win for The Brazilians will boost their chances of defending their title as they will move to third spot with 25 points from 13 games. They will be five points behind leaders Bidvest Wits who are two games ahead of them. For Amakhosi a win will help new coach Ernst Middendorp to get trust from their hard to please fans who are allegedly not happy that the former Maritzburg United and Bloemfontein Celtic coach has been given the job. The 60 year-old German born mentor has only been in charge of one league game, a 1-0 win over Supersport United on 12 December at Mbombela Stadium.
