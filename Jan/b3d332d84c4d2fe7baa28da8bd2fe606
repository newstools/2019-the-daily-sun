ANGRY residents who shut down a clinic on Tuesday said they wanted the head of department fired! The residents of G section in Umlazi, south of Durban, said they would not allow Dorothy Nyembe Clinic to operate until its water was restored. They claimed the head of the eThekwini health unit, Dr Nomakhosi Gxagxisa, was ignoring them. Mzwandile Ndlandla, chairman of the clinic committee, said they had been begging the municipality to fix the water issue since 2016. He said they closed the clinic because the conditions exposed patients to danger and Gxagxisa was undermining the clinic committee and residents. “Even Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has not helped us.” Ndlandla said they went to Gxagxisa’s office on Monday and she said they must wait but she later told them she would not see them. Gxagxisa’s deputy, Zinhle Buthelezi, denied there was a water crisis at the clinic and said the problem had been attended to. When the SunTeam told her they were calling from the clinic, she said she was in a meeting. Provincial health spokesman Sibongiseni Mkhize said he could not comment on the matter as the clinic was not in their department. Dr Gxagxisa said she did not manage clinics and she was only the executive director. She said area managers should explain what was going on in clinics. Area manager Nosipho Hlophe said she was not allowed to talk to the media.
