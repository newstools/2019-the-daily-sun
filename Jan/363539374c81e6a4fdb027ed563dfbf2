THEMBENI Khuboni was horrified when her husband suddenly left her after 30 years of marriage. She said her husband left her because she had not given him a son to continue his family name. The 56-year-old from KwaMancinza in KZN said her husband, Simon, started acting strangely at the beginning of last year. She soon found out that he was having an affair with a young girl working in his office. “When I asked him why he did it, he just left our home. I heard that he was living with the girl in Phoenix, Durban. I tried calling him but he wouldn’t answer the phone,” she said. Thembeni said in the middle of last year, Simon came and told her he wanted her to give him a son. “I told him I couldn’t. I have five daughters with him and he was happy before. Now suddenly he wants a son. I told him I can’t do that,” she said. Thembeni said then he left and told her he would find a woman who could give him a son. “In September, he came home with a photo of a baby he had with his nyatsi. Unfortunately, the baby is also a girl,” she said. When the SunTeam contacted him, Simon said he was not the first man to want a son to continue his line.
