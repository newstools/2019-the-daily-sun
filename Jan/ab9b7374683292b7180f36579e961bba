TWO Rastafarians from NU10 in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, are living in fear of long prison sentences after they were arrested two weeks ago. But Anele Zigoxo (42) and Sonwabo Boxa (30) said they did nothing wrong. Anele said: “We were arrested in Swartkops on 11 January while were on our way to buy medicine for our dogs. Two cops searched us and found zol on me and Sonwabo. “We didn’t resist arrest because we know possession of small quantities of dagga for personal use is allowed. But we were shocked when we arrived at Swartkops Police Station. The cops charge us with possession of mandrax.” Sonwabo said: “I don’t even know what mandrax looks like. This was just cruelty on the part of the police. We want the cops to show us the mandrax they claim was in our possession.” Sonwabo claimed they were moered by the cops. “I had injuries to my neck and body. We went to a doctor who asked us to fill out forms from Swartkops Police Station. We fetched the forms but the police refused to write information like our case number and the name of the investigating officer.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “Anele was caught with one mandrax tablet and three zols, while Sonwabo had one tablet and five zols.” Beetge said the rastas are free to open cases of assault at Motherwell Police Station.
