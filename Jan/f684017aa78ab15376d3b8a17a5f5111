Actress Cindy Mahlangu is fairly new in the industry but her star just keeps shining. She quickly became Mzansi’s latest on-screen darling. Everyone has been talking about this beauty over her character, Dumazile Mthethwa on Mzansi Magic’s The Herd. Speaking to SunBuzz, she said: “I worked very hard to shape my craft last year. My career took off very well and I had a great year.” The 22-year-old from Mpumalanga recently appeared on Mzansi Magic’s hit, The Queen. She plays Siyanda – a fiancee of a famous soccer star. “I didn’t sleep the night before the auditions. They were very tricky. Going there not knowing what’s going to happen was scary, but I had fun,” she told SunBuzz. “I left saying that if I don’t get a call back, it’s okay. On my way home I got a call that I got the role.” Talking about her character, Cindy said: “Siyanda is extremely different from Cindy. “What I love most about the character is that it’s very challenging. I had to dig very deep to understand how a mum left by her fiance feels. I had to understand and feel those emotions. “She is still around. People are going to see a lot that is going to happen and it’s going to be interesting.” She said this year she wanted to grow and be able to play different roles.
