The 23-year-old from Silver City in Mangaung told Daily Sun she was in her yard with her four-year-old on Friday, when a young woman carrying bags asked for help. The mum said the woman suddenly stopped a taxi and tried to grab her son. “The woman said she needed help to get her child back after someone had taken the child. I lost focus on my own child and she stopped a taxi next to where I was standing with my friend on the side of the road. “Before I realised what was going on, the woman had grabbed my son and got into the taxi. “I managed to get the driver to stop and we caught the woman. “Residents wanted to beat her, but she was saved by a CPF member. “What shocked us was that she had photos of three different children in her bags, along with Sassa grant cards and muthi. “I think this woman steals kids.” The angry mum said she hoped the woman would give the police information about those responsible for human trafficking. “I want her to rot in jail and hope if she has stolen babies, they will be reunited with their families. “I no longer feel comfortable when my son is out of my sight.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the incident and said the woman was arrested. “A case of child kidnapping was registered and the 28-year-old suspect will be appearing in court soon.”
