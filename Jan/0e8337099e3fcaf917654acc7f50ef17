THE ANC Sedibeng regional offices were burnt down in the early
hours of Monday morning. The ANC Gauteng Province said it condemns in the
strongest possible terms acts of criminality by unknown arsonists who burned their
offices. Gauteng ANC provincial executive committee spokesperson Tasneem
Motara said that at this stage, the report they have from the caretaker, who
was in the property at the time, is that he was awakened by the sound of
breaking windows and the next thing he knew the building was set on fire. He escaped unharmed from the incident. A case of arson is being opened this morning with the
Vereeniging SAPS so that the police can help to bring to book those behind this
criminal act. “The burning of our offices is tantamount to an attack on
the people of Sedibeng and it is an act of cowardice by people who want to use
violence and threats to undermine the work of the ANC in the Region,” said
Motara.
