THE Zonzis were overjoyed when their son finally got a wheelchair on Friday. The People’s Paper first published a story about the family’s struggle in 2017. At the time, parents Andries (39) and Matlakala Zonzi (38) from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, pleaded with SunReaders to help them get a wheelchair for their 16-year-old son Keletso. The teenager has been unable to walk, sit, speak or feed himself since he was a baby. Andries said they had taken him to different doctors but they never got help. He said the boy needed to see a specialist, but the family could not afford to take him. Cope councillor Selata Nkwane was touched by the family’s story and started raising funds to buy Keletso the model of wheelchair best suited to his needs. “I bought the wheelchair but I had a setback because I misplaced the newspaper, which made it difficult to find the details of where Keletso lived. All I knew was that he was in Hammanskraal,” said Nkwane. He said after struggling for a long time to locate the family, he was able to hand over the gift last week. Andries was happy when he received the wheelchair and said it would allow his son to go outside to play with other kids. “My son will be able to make friends and enjoy the fresh air instead of always being stuck in bed. “I pray to God to bless Mr Nkwana for such a beautiful gift. I’d also like to thank the People’s Paper for reaching out to people.” He said he was happy to see the smile on his son’s face when he was put in the wheelchair. “Keletse loves his gift and now he is a happy child.”
