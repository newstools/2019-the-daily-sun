SMALL and emerging businesses from villages in Collins Chabane Municipality, Limpopo, will soon be smiling all the way to the bank. The department of small business development and the Matsila Community Development Trust have given them equipment to improve their businesses. This came about as a result of the vision of Chief Livhuwani Matsila, who wanted to see residents doing things for themselves. The handover ceremony of compressors, fridges, friers, stoves and ice-making machines was held on Monday at Joe Matsila Guest House in Matsila Village, Limpopo. Beneficiary, businessman Rudzani Nedzamba (46), who owns Bossru General Trading, said it came at the right time. “We have been battling on our own. Our businesses will never be the same after what we got today. “We wholeheartedly thank the chief, who knocked at government’s doors for our sake,” Rudzani said. Speaking on behalf of the department, Kgolane Thulare said the equipment was part of a departmental programme to empower local businesses to grow. He said they hoped to help each business to the tune of R80 000 but due to demand, had to reduce it to R15 000. “This is the first phase and you are lucky to be the first in this area. We will be coming back. Work hard, so we upscale our support.” Matsila said he hated seeing people suffer. “This is for our people. We are happy these people are now creating jobs for themselves. “The benefiting villages are Tsonga and Venda speaking. It shows we are bringing people together,” he said.
