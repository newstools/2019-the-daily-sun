DEPUTY President David Mabuza fulfilled a promise he made to 15 families when he officially opened the doors to their new houses on Monday. The houses were built for disadvantaged families who stayed in mud houses in Umjindi in Barberton, Mpumalanga. Mabuza said: “I made a promise and thank God I was able to come back and do what I promised. When it rains they won’t have to worry any more “I am happy our people are going to sleep in their new houses.” He also donated groceries to each family and promised to build a further 100 houses for the community of Louisville near Lily mine. Delisile Mahlalela (30), who was staying in a two-roomed house with her siblings and their kids, said she was grateful for the house. “We have been sharing our small house with my siblings. Life was hard as our mother died while we were still young. We had no hope but today we feel that Mabuza has restored it. We are forever grateful. This is a present we will cherish forever. We wish that he continues to change other people’s lives as well,” she said.
