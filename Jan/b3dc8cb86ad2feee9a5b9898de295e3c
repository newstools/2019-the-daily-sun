NELSON Toane and nine customers at a salon came face to face with death on Tuesday. The 25-year-old from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, was doing a client’s hair when the wall of the house next door suddenly collapsed on his shack. Within minutes, everyone in the mkhukhu which houses the salon was lying under the bricks. “I am lucky to be alive. It was a miraculous escape,” said Nelson, who was taken to hospital for treatment. Among the injured were eight pupils who were at the salon to get their hair cut before going back to school. “We were all trapped underneath the collapsed shack. The incident happened after it started raining heavily. I heard a loud bang and before I knew it, we were buried under bricks and steel.” Nelson said he passed out when the shack collapsed and woke up a few moments later to find himself trapped. “We all screamed for help and before we knew it, people were pulling us out. I consider myself lucky as I was quickly discharged from hospital. “The other nine are sadly still in hospital.” Selinah Ramashaba (44), a neighbour in the yard where the salon stood, said when she saw the wall collapse it was like a movie. “I couldn’t see anyone but I heard people screaming. Other neighbours and people passing by came rushing to help.” Ekurhuleni Emergency Services spokesman William Tladi said: “Our medics responded to an incident where a wall collapsed and eight injured children were taken to Daveyton Clinic,” he said.
