FELIX Mupambe (61) is grateful to his ancestors for saving his life. The madala from Boschkop in Tshwane said a tree fell on top of his caravan on Thursday. “A huge storm destroyed my property and almost killed me last week. Now this has happened,” he said. Felix told Daily Sun that he was alone when the accident happened. “My right hand and leg were injured, but I’m getting better even though I’m still struggling to walk,” he said. “God is alive and my ancestors protected me. I would be dead if it wasn’t for them.” He said the tree looked normal on the day of the accident, and he never imagined it could be blown over by strong wind. “I’m starving because my taxi was also damaged beyond repair. It was my only source of income,” he said. The father of three said he needed help to have his caravan repaired as well as buy another taxi. Felix’s grandchild Lerato Motloung (32) said her madala lost a lot. She said his taxi put food on the table and there would have no more income now that it was damaged. “We are happy he didn’t die. What was damaged can be replaced, but life is precious and can never be replaced,” she said. Outgoing Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said the City would contact Felix to offer assistance.
