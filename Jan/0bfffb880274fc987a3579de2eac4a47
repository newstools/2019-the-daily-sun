According to a frustrated parent from Montic Primary School in Zonkizizwe, Ekurhuleni, pupils could not start school as a farm school in the area was closed following disagreements between the education department and the owner. A mum said the owner closed the school after the department did not agree to his lease conditions. She said the school belonged to a farmer, who started it for the kids whose parents worked for him for more than 30 years. “Last year the man said he wanted to use his farm for another business.” According to her he said as his workers did not have kids, he wanted to close it. “The department wanted to take it over, but he wanted R80 000 rent a month, which the department refused to pay. Now the school is cAlosed.” Gauteng Education Department spokesman Steve Mabona was not available for comment.
