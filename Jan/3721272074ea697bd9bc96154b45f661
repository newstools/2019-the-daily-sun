International House DJ and producer  SHIMZA wants to bury the hatchet with old foe Prince Kaybee this year. The pair’s rivalry intensified when Shimza accused Prince Kaybee of stealing music from young up-and coming musicians a while back. This was after Prince Kaybe made a collaboration with up-and-coming musicians LaSoulmates, TNS and Zanda on the single Club Controller. The song became a hit and many South Africans fell in love with it. As the song became more popular, the pair’s dispute gain more traction and attention as it played out on social media. Prince Kaybee on the other hand had been adamant that he “started working on Club Controller way back in June with LaSoulmates and TNS,” however, “the song leaked with a wrong title” and he had been trying to correct that mistake ever since. Meanwhile Shimza insisted that he got the song first. Today Shimza shared a message apologising to Prince Kaybee on social media. After everything that has happened between them, Shimza wants to make peace and start the year on a clean slate. The message read: “Ola, bro I think this thing must just stop, not worth it at all to be showing division to even kids coming after us. If there is anything I’ve said or done to offend you I would like to apologise - All love from my side.” The musician added that 2019 should be about positive vibes and setting a good example. Shimza seems to regret his part in what led to the rivalry and what it might have done to his fellow industry peer. After he realised that his message on WhatsApp had only one tick.He said “I think he blocked me on WhatsApp as well.”
