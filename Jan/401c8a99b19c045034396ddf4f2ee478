NATIONAL Children’s Theatre is giving the youth the opportunity to learn more about drama. A series of workshops organised by the theatre will give children aged between seven and 17 a chance to explore the world of expressive arts. The workshops will take place throughout the year at the theatre in Parktown, Joburg. The initiative will help participants improve their confidence and boost their self-esteem. The programme will also equip children with the tools they need to face the adult world. The workshops boast unique and fun classes for children to develop their leadership abilities, strengthen their people skills and discover their hidden potential. For the first school term – which starts on 19 January and ends on 9 March – the classes will take place every Saturday from 9am to 12pm. Children will be grouped according to their age. The syllabus includes dancing, acting, singing and physical fitness. Refreshments are supplied between classes and bursaries are available. Coba-Maryn Wilsenach, the theatre’s director of arts education, is responsible for the programme, as well as its special events and outreach projects. She previously played the role of King Lear in The House of Bernarda Alba. Wilsenach has also starred in Lady Anne, Audrey, Rys en Aartappels, Hex and Medea.
