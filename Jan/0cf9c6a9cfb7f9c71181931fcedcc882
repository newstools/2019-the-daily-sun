THE South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has
expressed concern over a Facebook advert selling its cards. According to SASSA there’s a man selling SASSA cards on
Facebook, which are suspected to be stolen. “The stolen cards are sold for different amounts of money by
the scammers. These stolen cards were immediately deactivated and are
worthless, so the public is warned not to be tempted to try and buy them as
they are useless," SASSA Spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said. SASSA and the South African Post Office are said to be
working with the police to arrested the suspects. SASSA Acting CEO, Abraham Mahlangu said: "no grants can
be drawn from the stolen cards and anyone buying them stands to lose out and if
caught may be charged with possession of stolen property.” Mahlangu alerted beneficiaries that SASSA services are free
and not for sale. “They are also advised to refrain from sending their ID
numbers, PINS and SASSA card numbers to strangers as these are part of the
scams to defraud them,” Mahlangu added. He said selling of SASSA cards is illegal and criminal!
Beneficiaries are urged to report such incidents to the police or alert SASSA. The ceo said beneficiaries of social grants need to be extra
vigilant as there are many fraudsters who will target the innocent and
vulnerable.
