FAMILY and friends celebrated gogo Elizabeth Nabane’s 100th birthday on Saturday. A great celebration was organised for gogo at her home in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. The emotional gogo shed tears as her 11 grandchildren, 14 great-grand children and seven great-great grandchildren surprised her. Since two of her four children have died, she is now left with two daughters. Elizabeth is the first family member to turn 100 and was showered with gifts. Despite one of her legs being amputated 50 years ago, she is still going strong. During the celebration, she serenaded the crowd with gospel songs. Her granddaughter Joyce Molefe-Kukane said they were lucky to have their gogogo turning 100. “She is the only one in our family who has been blessed to reach 100 years. “To spoil her, the family decided to have a birthday celebration to celebrate her blessings,” she said. Joyce said her gogo was still healthy. “Except her losing her hearing, she is still as healthy as a horse. “She can sing, read and speak English. She loves singing,” Joyce said. Asked what kept Elizabeth healthy, she said she was keen on maintaining a good diet. “Since back in the day, she has eaten healthily. “She still loves her vegetables and fruit to this day. “She reads more than anything else and spends her days crocheting.” Joyce said the whole family felt blessed that Elizabeth was still alive and wished her many more years to come. The gogo shared her joy with the People’s Paper. “I am happy to be celebrated,” Elizabeth said. “I hope the Lord blesses me with more years to see my children and their children grow.”
