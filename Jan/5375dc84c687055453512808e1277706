Musician and MiCasa front man, J’Something has reflected on how hard 2018 was for him, the hardest year yet he says. The singer whose real name is Joao da Fonseca took to his social media to share with his fans, some of the uncomfortable lessons he had to learn in 2018. “Hardest year of my life. Without a shadow of a doubt. I don’t wish anything that happened to us on my worst enemy. But this right here is how I sum up my year ... the people around you are God in the flesh,” he began. He then went on to urge people to value their loved ones while they still can because, according to him, it is through them that one can find God. “The love around you is God revealing Himself to you. I am thankful for the people I’ve had around me this year. Specially the last 6 months. If you’ve been around me in the last 6 months for a show, or whatever it was just know that my spirit has been extremely low but you helped me to carry on,” he said. The 31-year-old did not wish to divulge exactly what made 2018 so difficult, but he did take the opportunity to give out some free advice. “Maybe one day I’ll share about everything that’s been going on but for now I just wanna encourage you all to never lose faith for it is by faith that we conquer. Don’t take your friends and your family for granted ... and make time for yourself always,” he said. “2019 is the year of focus for me. It’s the year of nurturing all that I have and being content with what is around me,” he concluded. In a separate post, J shared his resolutions for 2019. “This year is the year of focus and nurturing for me. Appreciating the things I have, be it the relationships I ALREADY have, my health, my career, my businesses, etc,” he said.
