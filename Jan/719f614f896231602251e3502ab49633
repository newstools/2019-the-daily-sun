 A 38-year-old man was arrested for the brutal murder of his girlfriend. The couple were allegedly involved in a domestic conflict in
Madikoti, outside Marble Hall. The residents reportedly heard desperate cries of a woman
coming from the nearby bushes, seeking help and immediately rushed to the
place. Police Costable Maphure Manamela said upon arrival, they
found the suspect brutally assaulting the victim with a hard object and called
the police. The suspect managed to flee from the scene before the police
could arrive. "The medical emergency services were also called to the
scene, sadly the woman was certified dead. The police continued with the manhunt for the suspect until
he was arrested today at Wolwekraal village, shortly after the incident," Manamela
said. The woman was identified as Catherine Mujalanga from
Zimbabwe. The suspect will appear in the Groblersdal Magistrate's Court
on a charge of murder.
