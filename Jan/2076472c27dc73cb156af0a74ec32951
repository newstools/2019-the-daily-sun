AFRO-POP diva Simphiwe Dana has signed a record deal with Universal Music Group South Africa. The songbird joins the likes of rapper Nasty C, singer Lady Zamar and duo Mafikizolo as some of the big names signed to the label. The 39 year took to social media to share the news with her fans, also announcing that she has some treats in store for them which include an album. The deal will also see the singer take up a role where she will “identify, develop and groom new artists plus those artists who never got a proper chance during the production of their work.” She made the announcement on her birthday. “In the past year there was so much I couldn’t talk about,” she said on Instagram. “Everything seemed to be taking forever and I had to trust the process. And write and write and write, to offset how heavy my spirit can get, my songs are testimony to this, I try and keep life light around me. “I love to joke and laugh to keep that ever present depression away. I’m happy to say on my birthday that I have finally signed that contract which took me months and months to negotiate. I also have some other surprises for you in store.”
