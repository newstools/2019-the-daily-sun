ONE corpse is in a bad state, while another is missing! Two families want answers from the Eastern Cape Health Department, since the bodies were being kept at the Mthatha mortuary. The Ngcothwana family in Lower Thyolo Mqanduli allegedly found maggots on their daughter’s body on Monday when they took it to a private mortuary. Noluvo Ngcothwana (20) died on the way to Zithulele Hospital in Elliotdale on 4 January. She had allegedly tried to commit suicide after learning she had failed matric. Her shocked dad, Melvin Ngcothwana (54), told Daily Sun: “I was in Mthatha when I got a call to say my daughter had disappeared. My sons looked for her and found her body in an abandoned house. “They rushed her to hospital but she was declared dead on arrival. “Her body was taken to Mthatha, where I was told to fetch it on Monday after the autopsy.” Melvin said when they took the body to a private undertaker, they showed them it was damaged. “Maggots were going in and out of the mouth and the body was very dark. I spoke to the forensic team at the mortuary but they refused to take responsibility.” He said he would sue whoever was responsible. “This hurt us even more while battling to deal with how our daughter died.” Provincial health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha denied the allegations, saying the body only had a white stain. “We keep corpses refrigerated and there is no way it could be damaged,” Sicwetsha said. Health MEC Helen Sauls-August said: “The mortuary said the autopsy was done on 8 January but the body was not found the next day when the family came to fetch it.”
