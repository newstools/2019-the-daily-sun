PATIENTS were being turned away from the Motherwell NU8 Clinic in Port Elizabeth yesterday. Nursing staff were on a sit-in to demand better security. The clinic corridor was overflowing with desperate patients waiting to be treated. The nurses were angry last Monday when they discovered that criminals had entered the clinic at night and stole medication, including ARVs. Kholeka Lugalo, vice-chairwoman of the clinic committee, told Daily Sun: “We had a meeting last week again after criminals broke into the clinic but nothing fruitful happened. “There’s only one security guard and he doesn’t even have a shed for when the weather is bad. We need security to be improved. Criminals broke in last year and stole computers.” Lugalo said they have a dumpsite outside the clinic and when it burns, the smoke comes into the health facility. “In November, a nurse had to be hospitalised after she inhaled the smoke. We want the site removed or a wall built around it.” A 76-year-old gogo who suffers from arthritis said she came to the clinic early in the morning and went home without being treated. She said: “I was here on Friday and I was not treated. Nurses told us to come back on Monday. I am sick and I can’t afford to buy medicine from the pharmacy.” Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetcha said it was unacceptable for nurses to withdraw their services when their grievances were being investigated. “We will take disciplinary action, and the no work, no pay principle will be applied. We are directing patients to nearby facilities.”
