Mercedes-Benz
has lifted the covers off the new CLA at CES 2019 in Las Vegas. But
wait, that looks like the A-Class sedan? Yes,
it does, a lot actually. But if you take a very close look you’ll notice some
difference. Subtle,
but they are there. First
of all the CLA is “swoopier” and more coupeish than the A-Class sedan. The new
CLA looks like a shrunken CLS coupe, sad faced rear-end and all. Its
proportions make a lot more sense than the A-Class sedan’s. “As
a four-door coupé, the new CLA intrigues with its puristic, seductive design
and sets new standards in the design DNA of ‘sensual purity” Gorden Wagener,
Chief Design Officer of Daimler AG says. It
seems like the A-Class sedan will not be sold in South Africa. So
if you want a sedan the size of the A-Class, the CLA will be it. Inside the
design is the same as you’ll find the A-Class hatchback. It
features a more advanced MBUX infotainment. It’s still presented onto two
widescreens and now you get a cleverer “Hey Mercedes” voice assistant. “the
voice assistant ‘Hey Mercedes’ is able to recognise and answer considerably
more complex queries,” says Sajjad Khan, Member of the Divisional Board of
Mercedes-Benz Cars for CASE and Head of Digital Vehicle & Mobility. The
system is no longer confused by passenger conversations, only responding to the
last person who said ‘Hey Mercedes’. The
new CLA is longer, wider, and shorter than its predecessor. It also has a
longer wheelbase, with a wider track. Mercedes-Benz reckons that all this gives
the CLA “the sportiest driving characteristics of all models in the new
generation of compacts from Mercedes-Benz.” The
company has also worked the suspension to this effect. Engine
wise, the new CLA is expected to share with its hatchback sibling. The
car was the CLA 250 with a 2.0-litre petrol engine producing a healthy 165kW
and 350Nm with a 7-speed DCT. The
CLA is expected to hit our shore in the third quarter of the year.
