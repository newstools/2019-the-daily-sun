TAXI drivers and hawkers from Acornhoek and Ximungwe in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga had HIV and other tests during a health screening programme last week Friday at Toronto taxi rank. The programme was organised by the department of health and the Bushbuckridge Municipality. Speaking to Daily Sun, health and wellness HIV co-ordinator, Gay Moreme, said the purpose of the campaign was to bring health services to the people. “We realised that most taxi drivers and hawkers work long hours and don’t have time to visit the clinic for health check -ups,” she said. Moreme said the tests included those for HIV, TB,sexually transmitted infections, hypertension, diabetes, eye screening and cervical cancer. Condoms were distributed and their use demonstrated. Taxi driver Khapela Mabuya thanked the department of health for bringing the service to those who don’t have time to go for check-ups. He said he wished the campaign could be rolled out every month, so that many lives could be saved. He said everyone should get tested so that if they have any diseases, they can be advised on which medicine to take. “Many lives have been lost due to a lack of knowledge,” said Mabuya.
