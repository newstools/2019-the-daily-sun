MALCOLM X said he wants to continue blessing the less fortunate, even after he leaves this world. The businessman, who’s known for dishing out cash to the needy, told Daily Sun he’d donate R50 000 to students at different campuses this year. And he’s planning to draw up a will. “I’m seeing my lawyers to include students in my will so the trend doesn’t die after my death,” said Malcolm (52). He said when varsities open, he’ll visit different campuses to help students as he’s been doing over the past few years. “It will be a continuation from the R30 000 I’ve been donating on a monthly basis. Individual students will get smaller or larger amounts, depending on their debt.” He’s committed to helping others. “I was born into extreme poverty, grew up in poverty, and studied in libraries on an empty stomach. “I hate it when students study on empty stomachs and lack basics like food, toiletries and transport.” He said although he’s not very rich, he never forgets those in need. “I learnt long ago that you don’t have to be rich to start giving. Through my videos and photos, I’ve inspired thousands to start giving.”
