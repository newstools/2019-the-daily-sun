THIS weekend, people across Mzansi registered to vote. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident and said two people were arrested and expected in court today. Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube visited a voting station at Embizweni High School in Umlazi to monitor the processes. Sicelo community leader Koena Mokoena said the government made empty promises. He said they would not vote until they got what they needed. Although there were no disruptions in Soweto, Motsoaledi squatter camp resident Xolisile Maxhalanga (32) said they were tired of being sidelined and would vote for someone who would change things. Deputy president David Mabuza was in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, where he promised residents water and lights. “I want government to provide jobs, that’s all I want from them,” she said. Community member Moses Thani said: “What the government does during this time is make empty promises. We are tricked year in and out and we still live like forgotten people.” Sanco chairman Amahlathi said they decided to boycott because the governing party appointed leaders who did not care about the people. Meanwhile, at a voting station at Nomzamo Hall in Newlands, outside East London, cops had to force open a locked gate as residents protested outside and demanded land and electricity. In Motherwell NU29, residents protested outside the voting station but didn’t prevent anyone from registering. They said they wanted a proper school for their children.
