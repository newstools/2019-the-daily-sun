THE stink is unbearable as sewage gushes into the streets. And yesterday, non-striking workers, taximen and ANC members decided they were gatvol and cleaned Mthatha. The streets of the town have been turned into a dumping ground since King Sabata Dalindyebo municipal workers downed tools two weeks ago. They were demanding that contract workers be permanently employed and have better working conditions. Unions have called for the removal of mayor Dumani Zozo and acting municipal manager Mbulelo Sigaba. They accused them of losing R65 million to corruption. The Border Taxi Alliance joined the campaign. Its chairman in the region, Sithandile Sikomela, said: “We want our town clean so we can get on with business as usual. The strike action is affecting our business negatively.” The ANC’s municipal chairman, Malungisa Khebeni, said: “Until the investigation into the missing money has been completed, we will not take action.”
