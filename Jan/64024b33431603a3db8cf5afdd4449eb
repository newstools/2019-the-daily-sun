RESIDENTS said they would continue with their protest until Premier Job Mokgoro personally addressed them. Yesterday, the people of Letlhabile Block 1 near Brits, in North West barricaded the main road to the kasi with branches and burning tyres. They said they have been promised that the kasi would be developed for the past three years. They complained about the lack of services and admitted that they used illegal electricity and water connections. Community leader Aobakwe Selepe said they have been talking to the Madibeng Municipality, but only got empty promises. The last meeting was in October and they are tired of waiting. He said they also didn’t want the ANC provincial task team. “Unless they provincial government comes to speak to us, we won’t stop protesting,” said a resident said. Municipal spokesman Tumelo Tshabalala confirmed receipt of the request for comment from Daily Sun and said he’d send it to the relevant department.
