VILLAGERS, believing their public transport problems would soon end, were excited that a taxi rank was being built. The R2,7 million rank, at Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, was built by the Greater Letaba Municipality in 2015. Villagers are worried that it has become a white elephant. Taxis don’t park at the rank but park almost 2km away instead. It is a struggle for most villagers to get to the spot. Taxis belonging to the Bolobedu United Taxi Association park far from the village. A 31-year-old villager said: “The municipality shouldn’t have built the rank because it’s useless. “Instead, the money should have been used for services such as water. “That’s what we need most. I only see one or two taxis going to Polokwane parked there. “We want taxis travelling from the village to Mooketsi, Kgapane and Modjadjiskloof, and these taxis are the ones they park at the spot.” Some villagers have now resorted to using the rank to host events and festivals. Taxi owner Majoboko Makola said: “The rank is useless and was built in the wrong place. There are used condoms and booze bottles.” Association boss Robert Mothombeni said: “When we park at the rank, villagers hitchhike. We start work at 5am. That’s when people can find our taxis at the rank.”
