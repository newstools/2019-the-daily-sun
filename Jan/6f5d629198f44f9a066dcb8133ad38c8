FURIOUS parents have accused no-fee schools of chasing away their children because they could not make donations. Parents from Entokozweni kasi in the Eastern Cape said their kids were left roaming the streets last week after schools in nearby towns like Ugie and Maclear turned them away. One of the angry parents said: “Of great concern to us is that some of the no-fee schools are charging fees but calling it fund-raising. “In some instances, these schools demand payment before pupils can be registered.” Another parent said Sibabale Secondary School in Ugie was demanding a non-refundable fee of R20 for a registration form that was supposed to be free. “They are also charging R250 for fundraising. Some schools in Maclear are charging R400 per child although they are not supposed to do so,” said the parent. “We have reported this to the district office but have received no positive response. “We were just told that officials and SGBs had decided to make parents pay to employ extra teachers.” The parent said some pupils were chased away last week and told to collect the money from their parents before they could attend classes. Sibabale SGB chairman said: “Towards the end of last year, we had a general meeting where parents decided that every parent will pay R250 to hire two extra teachers as some grades were short of teachers.” Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima urged communities to report no-fee schools trying to get money out of parents to district officials so that action could be taken.
