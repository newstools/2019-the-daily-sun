Residents of Philippi in Cape Town have taken the struggle for land to a new battlefield. They are building shacks on old railway tracks. They said they had been asking for space to live and now had taken the matter into their own hands. Father of three Fuzile Mlomo (46) said he had been renting for 24 years and was gatvol. Fuzile said all they wanted from government was services. “They give us running water and toilets. If Prasa plans to remove us they must come. We’re ready to defend our land.” Phillip Zulu (57) said only people from Samora and Philippi were allowed to erect shacks in the area. “There are no jobs and the rent was really killing us,” he said. A 48-year-old mother of four told Daily Sun she saw people build shacks and followed them. “It would be sad if we were to be asked to vacate this land.” Prasa spokeswoman in the Western Cape Riana Scott said illegal occupation of the tracks had been a problem for a long time. “This site is the old Philippi depot, which is earmarked for modernisation. Prasa has previously successfully relocated households elsewhere in Khayelitsha.” She said they are relying on engagement with community leaders and the provision of alternative serviced land.
