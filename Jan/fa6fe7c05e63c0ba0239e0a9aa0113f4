RESIDENTS of Greenville in Alexandra, north of Joburg, say life has been chaotic since their shacks burned down. They’ve been homeless since a fire broke out early last month. Gauteng Premier David Makhura visited the area shortly after the incident and said government was working hard to help residents rebuild their homes and get new IDs. But over the weekend residents told the SunTeam they had not received much help. Shirley Tati said: “Only five sheets of zinc for roofing were distributed to each family. “When officials returned for their second distribution, they told us we’d not be getting more because other people pretending to be fire victims were taking materials. “It’s not our fault they didn’t have a database of victims.” A resident said: “Home Affairs officials promised to help us get new IDs, but they randomly picked 20 people and only seven got IDs. “What about the rest of us?” The premier’s spokesman Thabo Masebe said Makhura got the relevant departments to help residents. He advised them to direct their complaints to the human settlements department as they were involved in the distribution process. Despite many attempts to get hold of Home Affairs and the human settlements department, officials could not be reached for comment.
