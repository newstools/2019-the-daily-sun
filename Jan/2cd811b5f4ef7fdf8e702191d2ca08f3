THUGS used to have it easy in Hillbrow, but things are changing. The area in Joburg used to be known as a place where thugs could rob people in broad daylight without anyone doing anything. But now residents are gatvol. Last week, Daily Sun published a story about a man who was set alight after robbing a woman.  On Tuesday, there was another incident where a thug narrowly escaped an angry crowd. He and two armed friends entered a salon and apparently robbed hairdressers of their money and cellphones. Two of the men left the scene but the other thug stayed behind to search the women.  The women screamed for help and residents quickly responded. The thug tried to run away but residents caught him in the basement of a building. After getting some hot klaps, the thug was taken to the street, where they planned to burn him.  Luckily, police patrolling the area saw what was happening and rescued him. Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said the suspect, who is in his 20s, was arrested for armed robbery and will appear in court today.
