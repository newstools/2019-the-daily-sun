LAST year, Daily Sun published a story about a group of young men who celebrated Spring Day by dressing up to impress. The friends, who called themselves the Mapolopolo Brothers, said they were all matric pupils at Tsoseletso High School in Mangaung, Free State. Now it has emerged that all 16 of them passed their matric exams and their dedication to fashion, which kept them away from gangs, and their discipline, paid off. When the SunTeam recently met the group in Kagisanong kasi, Tshidiso Kwari (18) said he was happy to be part of the team. “I love fashion because it enhanced my self-confidence and installed more discipline in me,” he said. Neo Mekgoe (18), the group’s stylist, said they would continue dedicating themselves to fashion. “We have all passed and we have made our parents proud. We will accept new people interested in joining and I will style them free of charge,” he said. Another member, Kgomotso Maroku (18), said he planned to study engineering at Central University of Technology. “Our dedication to style helped me pass the final exam. I was always confident and happy,” he said. Resident Pule Moseki (37), who took the photo that brought the SunTeam’s attention to the group, said he would encourage his 16-year-old twin boys to join this year. “I am a dad of twins who love nice clothes. I will ask if they are interested in joining the group. I think they will agree because they love fashion,” Pule told the People’s Paper.
