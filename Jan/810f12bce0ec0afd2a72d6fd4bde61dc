MASTER cane weaver Andrew Nakeng (41) regards each of his students as unique, with different needs. Andrew, from Makgato Village in Ga-Malebogo, Limpopo, teaches cane weaving at the Joburg Society for the Blind. He teaches his students how to make cane trays, baskets, chairs and tables from scratch. “Weaving gave me a new lease on life after I became blind in 2008. “Maybe that’s why I give new life to broken cane chairs that are brought in for repairs.” Andrew learned the skill in 2011 as he wanted to do something productive instead of sitting at home doing nothing. “I have kids and a wife to support, and I’m glad I’m a teacher today,” said Andrew. He said he needed to be patient when teaching to ensure his students could understand. “I’ve trained more than 20 people and some of them work for furniture manufacturers.” Andrew said the course takes 10 months to complete. His dream is to run a big workshop and teach at a school for pupils with special needs.
