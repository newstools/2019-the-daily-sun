WHILE many matric pupils express happiness over their successes, there are also those who failed and even turn to suicide to express their pain. Megan Hosking from Akeso Psychiatric Clinic Group told Daily Sun people aged 19 – 24 are seen to be the most at-risk group for depression and suicide. “About 20% of university students have suicidal thoughts at some point during their university career, and with student suicides, 90% are found to have had psychiatric problems,” she said. Hosking said in many cases, worrying leads to depression. “It is most important for the young person to take his or her time to adapt to the changes and not expect too much too soon. Mental health issues are more common than many realise,” she said. There are ways of helping teens to get through this difficult time.
