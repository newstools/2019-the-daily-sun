Movie and TV actress, Terry Pheto and the queen of Gqom music, Babes Wodumo are not at all impressed by the stunt pulled by rapper, Nomuzi ‘Moozlie’ Mabena. This after Moozlie had the entire country believing that she had been involved in a car accident. Last week Thursday, Moozlie’s friend and fellow rapper, Rouge, shared what appeared to be a screen recording of Moozlie’s InstaLive video in which the video ends with Moozlie being involved in an accident.

In the same evening, Rouge and other friends of Moozlie asked the country to help them locate Moozlie because they were worried about her well being. Naturally, the entire nation was concerned about Nomuzi and wondering how she was. Almost 24 hours later, Moozlie revealed that the whole thing was a PR stunt, without even apologizing to her concerned fans and industry peers who all but started a search party. “I partnered with Volkswagen and Drive Dry to make a change in 2019. We don’t want to see another year where thousands of lives are lost on our roads because of drinking & driving. Take the pledge and make the change to #VWDriveDry in 2019,” she said.

Among those who just aren’t impressed by the stunt, are Terry Pheto and Babe Wodumo. “In 2010 I lost 5 family members in a car crash. I don’t find this funny. Maybe I’m just triggered,” Terry said.
