Former YoTv star and now businesswoman Hulisani Ravele has joined 947. Ravele will host the Weekend Breakfast show alongside DJ Lusty. She took to social media to make the announcement after teasing fans about a new man in her life, whom she has revealed is her co-host, Lusky Nkohla. This comes after she left Capricorn FM last month after almost two years at Limpopo’s hottest frequency. “And here he is bakhithi! The ice to my fire, the still to my sparkling, DJ Lusky! The new man in my life, in our new home! That’s right, 947 is my new home on the airwaves! Lusky and I are your brand new 947 Weekend Breakfast hosts! Your Saturday and Sunday mornings, 7-10am, just got a whole lot of tsa!” she wrote on social media. And here he is bakhithi!
