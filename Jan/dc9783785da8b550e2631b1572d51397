DA GAUTENG premier candidate Solly Msimanga said the education department needs to explain itself. He said it must answer for the R11 million allocated to revamp Klipspruit West Secondary School. Msimanga visited the school in Klipspruit, Soweto yesterday. In 2017 and last year, residents protested against the appointment of a black principal. It was also the worst performing school in Gauteng, with only 43% of pupils passing last year. SGB chairwoman Jackie Mthombeni told Msimanga that after the chaos, the department promised to fix the school. But a walkabout at the school showed that promise was not kept. Sections were boarded and cupboards in the classes were broken, while lights were removed. Msimanga said: “Answers need to be provided.You cannot be allocating R11 million and all you see in the school are exposed pipes. “Projects were abandoned and we have seen whenever there is a lack of proper leadership, a school won’t perform well.” He applauded the appointment of the new principal and spoke about drugs and substance abuse in the community. “It doesn’t become a productive learning environment when kids who are high mix with kids really trying to concentrate in class.” Msimanga also called on police to play their role in ending the drug abuse in the area, which he said was filtering into the school. “Random drug testing and searches, as well as police visibility around the school, are needed urgently,” he said.
