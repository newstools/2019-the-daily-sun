MASONIC’S love of music was inspired by people from his village. The house and gqom DJ said he grew up in a community where music was part of the culture. Masonic, whose real name is Bonga Madonsela, is originally from Kwahlathi Village in KZN. Now he lives in Joburg. Masonic, who released a debut album titled Kwahlathi My Home, told SunBuzz: “I was inspired by the many singers in the village and I knew then that I’d study music after matric.” In 2013 he studied music and production at POW Academy in Durban. But after graduating he struggled to start a career in music. He then moved to Joburg. “At the time, getting opportunities in Durban was hard so I moved to Joburg, in the hope that opportunities would be easier to get because the music industry is broad in Jozi,” he said. “It took me two years to finally release my debut album because when I arrived in Joburg, things were done differently here. “I had to learn what kind of music Joburg people liked and that helped me release the album. “I’m happy that many people love Kwahlathi My Home.” He said the album is a mix of gqom, deep house and commercial house. Masonic said he was working on a single titled Rooted In His Light. It will be released next month. He said his dream was to start a recording label to help up-and-coming singers realise their dreams. “I want to help unknown artists realise their dreams and not struggle as I did in the music industry,” said Masonic.
