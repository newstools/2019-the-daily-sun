KHUZANI Mpungose and Mthandeni “Igcokamelisha” Manqele are known to be maskandi rivals who cannot stand each other. Now their feud has gone to another level. Just after Mthandeni accused Khuzani of leaking his album before it was released last month, he has organised a maskandi show to take place on the same day as Khuzani’s show. Traditional leaders and Ukhozi FM former station manager Bhodloza Nzimande have tried to intervene, but failed. Khuzani is set to make history by filling up the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 30 March, where maskandi artists will perform. But Mthandeni is organising a show for FNB Stadium in Joburg for the same date. Khuzani said he is not worried and he wished Mthandeni good luck for the day. He referred Daily Sun to his manager, Mthokozisi Zuma, saying he was handling everything regarding the show at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. Zuma said they heard Mthandeni might hire maskandi artists who have been hired by Khuzani. “We don’t want drama. We will try to work with him to organise times because maskandi artists are able to perform in more than one show a day,” he said. Mthandeni posted on his Instagram page that he was hosting a show at FNB on 30 March. Mthandeni said he was not trying to sabotage Khuzani’s show. “I did the same show at Ellis Park Stadium last year and it was too small. Therefore I decided to get the bigger venue.” He said 30 March was the only date he was available.
