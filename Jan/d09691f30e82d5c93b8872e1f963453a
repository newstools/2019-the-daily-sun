KENEILWE Mokale (40) said her four-year-old son was born with a problem stomach, but it became worse last year. The boy was admitted to Sebokeng Hospital, Vaal, due to tuberculosis in his intestines. She told Daily Sun Lebogang was two when his stomach became painful and started growing. “We have been going from one hospital to another but he is still in terrible pain,” she said. “They give him medication that helps but after few weeks the pain comes back,” Keneilwe said. She said his friends were always making fun of him. “When he comes back from playing with his friends I can tell that he is not okay,” she said. Her neighbour Paul Makhale posted on social media that if anyone wanted to help they could contact him. “I will do my best for this boy. He has a bright future and we will do everything in our power to fix this,” said Paul. “I’m pleading with SunReaders to help. The boy can’t even play with other kids.” He said if people could recommend a doctor they should come forward. “We’re also pleading with the community to work together and assist the boy by sending him to a private hospital. Your help will be highly appreciated,” said Paul. Lebogang told Daily Sun the other kids did not want to play with him. “The kids run away from me and my stomach is very painful. Mum said the doctors will fix me,” said Lebogang.
