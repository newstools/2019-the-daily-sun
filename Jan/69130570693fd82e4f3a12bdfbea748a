HER family reported the gogo (75) missing on Monday when she was not seen in church last Sunday. After gogo Thibeletsa Maloi’s burnt body was found in Kroonstad on Friday, they positively identified her by the operation scars on her feet. Her younger sister Yvonne Maloi (58) said gogo’s tenants owed her rent money. She told Daily Sun: “They tied her and took her to Kroonstad, where they burned and dumped her body at the dumping site. “All she wanted from them was her money. We could identify her by the scars on her feet. “We’re very sad and will bury her on Friday after she’s cremated.” Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the tenants were bust and cops were searching for gogo’s Peugeot 208, with the registration number FPT409FS. “On Wednesday, a couple was traced to Aliwal North, where they were linked to the crime and charged with murder. “Her tenants allegedly robbed the dead woman and strangled her to death. They then took her body to Kroonstad in her car.” The suspects will appear in court today.
