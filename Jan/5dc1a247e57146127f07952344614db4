CLINTON Larsen began his stint as Chippa United coach on a positive note when he claimed a 2-0 victory over Muhsin Ertugral’s Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership clash at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium yesterday. The defeat for Maritzburg means they remain bottom of the table and Ertugral has much work to do as he has not won a single encounter since he joined the Team of Choice in December. The result will put him under immense pressure as he has lost all four matches since he arrived at the club. Tebogo Tlolane and Andile Mbenyane’s goals in the second half ensured that Chippa end their 10 matches run without a victory. Tlolane and Mbenyane both scored their third goals of the 2018-19 PSL season. However, the Chilli Boys will remain in 15th position in the PSL table with 15 points equal with Baroka FC who are on 14th position due to a better goal difference. Larsen was on the Chilli Boys bench for the first time after replacing Joel Masutha who was sacked following a string of poor results. He is the fifth coach to be in charge of Chilli Boys this season. The other coaches who have been shown the door by Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi are Teboho Moloi, Dan Malesela and Eric Tinkler. Having now gone 14 straight league matches without a win, the Team of Choice already look like a side doomed for relegation and coach Ertugral admitted after the match that he is sad with the way things are going. From the first minute of the match Chippa were the better side compared to Maritzburg. Kurt Lentjies had a steel performance and was voted man of the match of this encounter. This will be a huge morale booster for Chippa ahead of their next league match against Mamelodi Sundowns which will be played at the same venue on Saturday 3pm. Maritzburg will continue for their first victory of the second round on Friday when they visit Bidvest Wits at Milpark at 8pm.
