THE three-day holy walk for Shembe church members has started. The aim of the pilgrimage to Ekhenana Mountain in Tongaat, KZN, is to pray for blessings. The sacred walk retraces the footsteps of the church’s founder, Isaiah Shembe. Church spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe said it looked as if the creator had already blessed the walk. “Everything is going well. The church leader is guiding us and members have come out in large numbers as always,” said Mncwabe. “Usually, when we begin our holy walk the sun becomes unbearably hot, but this time it is cloudy. “It’s as if the creator has given us an umbrella to protect ourselves.” He said they left in the early hours of the morning and stopped along the way so members could take a short rest before continuing the journey. He said they believe that taking part in the walk unlocks blessings and good luck that sustains them throughout the year. “At the mountain we pray that the year brings joy and prosperity to us and our families,” said Mncwabe. Ntombifikile Mzobe (56) from Empangeni said she was grateful she joined the walk. “As a mother of three young kids, I need to pray for them and ask God and our ancestors to help me raise them in this wicked world,” she said. “The year always runs smoothly after I come back from the mountain.”
