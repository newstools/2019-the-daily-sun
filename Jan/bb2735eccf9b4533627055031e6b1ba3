SHE saw that people needed beans so she started selling them! Today Mafumane Khakhau (47) is happy with the decision she made two years ago, as people are buying her beans and she’s making a good living. When the SunTeam met Mafumane in her two-roomed shack in Seroalo Kopi, near Thaba Nchu, she had only three packets of beans left for the day. “I did research and found out most residents went to town to buy beans as there was nobody selling them,” she told Daily Sun. She said she sold her sugar beans for R25 a packet. “These are the beans people love the most,” she said. “With the money I make I buy more stock and I save some of it to buy bricks so I can build a house one day.” Neighbour Masabata Liroeng (48) said she was glad Mafumane was selling the beans. “She has helped me save money because they are cheap and I don’t have to pay for transport to go to town. “My 13-year-old grandson enjoys them with pap. He says the beans help him concentrate at school.” And she said her doctor advised her to eat more sugar beans as they helped decrease blood sugar levels.
