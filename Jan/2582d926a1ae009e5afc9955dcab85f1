INMATES at a youth prison were left nursing injuries on Saturday after they were allegedly beaten up by warders. A source from within the prison told Daily Sun the inmates at Ekuseni Youth Development Centre, a juvenile prison in Newcastle, KZN, were beaten up for being too rowdy. “The warders came into their cell and accused them of making too much noise,” claimed the source. “They started beating them heavily. There was blood everywhere. “Some of the kids could not walk and they were left lying on the ground with no one to help them.” He said some of them even hid under the beds. The source alleged one inmate died as a result of injuries sustained. “Even if the kids were making a noise, there was no need to beat them up like that,” he said. He said the worst part was that prisoners had nowhere and no one to turn. “The people who abuse them are friends of those in management and their complaints are never taken seriously,” he claimed. KZN Correctional Services spokesman Bhuti Mchunu could not confirm that an inmate had died. He said no deaths were reported and that the preliminary report was being prepared. But Mchunu confirmed that the rowdy offenders were given a hiding by warders. “They were disciplined for transgressions that occurred,” he told the People’s Paper.
