Tshwane cops have issued a warning to students and parents to be careful of education scams. Captain Augustinah Selepe said bogus colleges misled students into believing they were registered with educational authorities and bodies. “They must be aware of fly-by-night institutions when looking for space as these institutions will give students qualifications that are not valid for employment or further studies.” Selepe encouraged students to research colleges before they register or make payments. “Before enrolling with a private higher education institution, ask for evidence that the institution and its programmes are registered. “This evidence is the certificate of registration and the registration number issued by the education department.” Selepe advised students to ask the higher education department to confirm the registration status of an institution.
