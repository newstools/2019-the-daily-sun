ANC deputy chairman in KZN, Mike Mabuyakhulu, said he would not challenge the seizure of his assets by the NPA until his corruption trial was finished. He was speaking to Daily Sun yesterday after the Asset Forfeiture Unit raided his house in Empangeni, north of KZN and attached his property, including his two German made cars. Mabuyakhulu said: “There is nothing I’m going to do or say about what they are doing. I’m not the person who wants to talk about a case that is still in court.” The seizure was confirmed by KZN provincial spokeswoman Natasha Kara, who said the unit was acting on the court order granted last month. The order asked to attach the assets of Mabuyakhulu and the seven accused in the corruption case involving R28 million meant to sponsor the North Sea Jazz Festival in 2013. The money was paid by the KZN Department of Economic Development and Tourism, which was under Mabuyakhulu as MEC. Although the festival was cancelled, the money was paid out and allegedly shared by Mabuyakhulu and other accused, including former Gagasi FM Dj Nothando “Mamgoh” Zungu. Mabuyakhulu allegedly received R300 000. The accused will be back in court on 15 February.
