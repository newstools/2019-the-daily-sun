PARENTS have started flocking into school uniform stores in large numbers. On Friday Gem Store on Pine Street in Durban was packed with hundreds of parents who had gone to buy their kids school uniforms. Daily Sun spoke to mum Dumisile Mzobe (32) who said she had travelled all the way from Inyamazane in Maphumulo, north of KZN to buy her daughter, Phiwokuhle Mzobe (12), her school uniform at the store. She said Phiwokuhle is going to do Grade 6 at Inyamazane Primary School. She said while other people may view the timing as last-minute rush, she does not view it the same way. “In December there are a lot of festivities that we do with our families. This includes buying kids anything they want to eat which might result in them gaining some kilos, so buying uniforms ahead of the festive season might be a problem if a child ends up gaining weight,” said Dumisile. She said she does not experience the challenge of not having enough money to buy her daughter a school uniform every January. “I always set it aside when I get paid in November. By doing so I am trying to avoid misusing the school uniform money for other things that we do during the festive season,” said Dumisile. She said she always preferred coming to the Gem Store because she likes the excellent service they provide. “I also like the brand because it has quality clothes that last my daughter the whole year,” said Dumisile. Gem store manager Muhammed Pandor said for several years they have managed to keep their customers happy: “Between December and January we employ about 200 matriculants to ensure that we have extra staff.”
