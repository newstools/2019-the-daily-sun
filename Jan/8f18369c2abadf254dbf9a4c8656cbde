Tributes are pouring in for radio jazzman Bra Mesh Mapetla. Former colleague and close friend Stan Bodibe said: “We were friends for over 10 years and the friendship was centred on music. “It was amazing to have worked with a man such as Mesh, who was charming. “He had an easy-going manner and had respect for his work. “Since I knew and worked with him, he never was late for work and always showed up for his gigs. “Ours was a smooth friendship without hiccups,” he said. The radio host, who contributed a lot to the jazz scene, died at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Monday. Mandla Baloyi said Bra Mesh was his mentor and it was through him that he became one of the best jazz promoters in the game. “Bra Mesh was something else. “I worked closely with him as a promoter at Blue Note, EMI and he taught me all I needed to know about jazz. He was my mentor and neighbour. I valued our friendship because he was humble.” Jazz artist Kunle Ayo said Bra Mesh was one of the few people who welcomed him when he landed in Mzansi from Nigeria. “He was a force to be reckoned with. I enjoyed listening to his show because of his love and understanding of jazz. We lost jazz itself in Bra Mesh,” said Kunle. Mesh’ former Radio Metro boss Koos Radebe said: “Mesh was a gentle giant. He was one of the first guys to be part of Metro in 1986. “My condolences to his family.”
