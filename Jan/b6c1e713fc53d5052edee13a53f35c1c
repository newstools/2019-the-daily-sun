Over the years, Emtee has been accused of having a drug problem. Those accusations grew even more when the rapper had his bizarre collapse during a performance in Limpopo last year. Emtee vehemently denied being on drugs at the time and he still maintains that he has never used in his life. The rapper admitted to being a dealer back in the day when he was down on his luck, but he insists he never used. “I use to be a dealer coz I was hungry. Ni**as turned around and called me a druggie. I sold that sh*t because I was broke! Never used it,” he said on social media. “I never had a drug problem. I was just in disbelief that people can do or say any and everything about you when you’re quiet and trying not start sh*t,” he added. Emtee said he only smokes zol.
