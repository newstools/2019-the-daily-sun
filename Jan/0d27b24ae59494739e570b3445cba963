DANCER Sibongile “Bad Ass Shazzy” Shongwe’s goal is to become one of the best twerkers is Mzansi. The 23-year-old from Boipatong in the Vaal said her passion for dancing started when she was at creche. Back then she would dance whenever music was played. She saw people dancing in music videos and realised she could turn her passion into a career. When she was 16 she grew fascinated by music videos of women twerking, so she gathered a group of friends and started learning how to twerk. The friends formed a group called Double on Twerk. The group got a lot of bookings and good reviews. Bad Ass said she is inspired by former dancer Faith “Queen Twerk” Nketsi. She said although a lot of people have negative opinions about twerking, her goal is to make money and own a dance studio. “There is a lot of stigma about twerking, but I’ll continue to do it because it helps me support my family. “I’m getting a lot of gigs that are growing my brand,” she said. “I know a lot of people don’t understand what I’m doing. My father said he doesn’t like what I do. “I want to study nursing because I enjoy helping people.” Bad Ass said the highlight of her career was sharing the stage with musician MoonChild Sanelly.
