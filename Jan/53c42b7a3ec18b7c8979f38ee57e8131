NEW Maritzburg United striker Thabiso Kutumela says the move to the Midlands club in Pietermaritzburg is an opportunity for him to regain his form. Kutumela has signed a three-year deal with the club. He is the third player signed by new coach Muhsin Ertugral in the current transfer window following the acquisition of Mpho Matsi and Judas Moseamedi, both on loan from Cape Town City. The 25-year-old was signed by Orlando Pirates in 2016 after a great performances for Baroka FC on their way to win promotion to the PSL. He scored 18 goals at the time to claim the National First Division Golden boot. This is a reunion for Kutumela and Ertugral, who brought him to Pirates. The player hopes to regain his scoring appetite, having scored a mere three goals in 30 appearances for Bucs. Interestingly, his last goal for the Soweto giants came against his new club in their 2-1 win at Orlando Stadium on 3 February last year. Maritzburg fans hope Kutumela’s signing will help them move away from the bottom of Absa Premiership table. He is expected to make his debut today (7.30pm) when The Team of Choice face defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld. The struggling side have the least goals in the league so far. They’ve only scored six goals this season. They have 11 points from 16 league matches. “It’s a good move for me and I hope to get my form back,” Kutumela said. “I’m happy to be in Pietermaritzburg and I am here to do what I love – play football and help my team win matches. “My new teammates are already making me feel at home. “Ertugral is good coach and I’m looking forward to renewing our working relationship. I feel he can get the best out of me.’’
