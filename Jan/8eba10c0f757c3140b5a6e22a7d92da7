“Agrizzi is much better than the so called investigative journalist” These were the harsh words from EFF Commander in Chief Julius Malema addressing the media on Wednesday. “He is a criminal himself, let’s not forget that, he’s a big criminal himself. But you know how mafias operate – there’s no honour among thieves” “He’s exposing them, they will expose him too,” Malema said. Malema says they are happy that they are exposing the leaders of the African National Congress, including Ramaphosa. The CIC says Cyril Ramaphosa must produce evidence that he has paid back the R500 000 funding from Bosasa. Malema says Ramaphosa has until end of the month to produce the evidence or else his party will turn the next State of the Nation Address into a Q and A session on Bosasa. “We warned about Ramaphosa, we warned about the new dawn, we warned about the Ramaphosa defence force, and we warned about Stratcom,” Malema says. Malema says other companies should also be subjected to the Bosasa process, and the nation would be shocked. “Ramaphosa said unprovoked in Parliament. My son has got a contract with Bosasa, I have went through the contract and I have satisfied myself. Later on Ramaphosa comes and says I was talking about the wrong contract,” said Malema. On the issue of the political party funding bill Malema says they will not be challenging the political party funding disclosing bill. "We wish it came early", Malema said. “The founding manifesto of the EFF actually speaks about that, that all political parties must disclose their funders,” Malema said.
