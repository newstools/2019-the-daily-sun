Fitness Guru Sbahle Mpisane has sent a message of support to her bae Itumeleng Khune after his injury. The Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper is set to miss the rest of the season after he sustained a shoulder injury in training. The Bafana Bafana shot-stopper watched helplessly from the stands with a brace on his arm as his team lost 2-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns over the weekend. Khune’s girlfriend, Sbahle, has shared a lovely message of support on social media. The fitness guru who is on her own road to recovery after a near fatal accident, encouraged her man to come back even stronger from the setback. “My babe please know that tough times never last but tough people do. I am with you in your dark times. You will overcome this injury in no time. Wish you nothing but speedy recovery my love,” she captioned a picture of the goalie on Instagram.
