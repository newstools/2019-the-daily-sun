POLICE in the Eastern Cape are appealing for information that could lead to the arrest of thugs who allegedly killed a spaza shop assistant on Wednesday. Sergeant Majola Nkohli said Kamesh police in Uitenhage are investigating a murder and business robbery case after three men raided a spaza shop. He said: “At about 7.30pm, three men allegedly entered a spaza shop. “One of them, armed with a firearm, stormed into a spaza shop in Tambo Crescent, Kamesh, Uitenhage.” Nkohli said the suspect with a firearm fatally shot Ibrahim Mizinga (31) and then held the spaza shop owner up at gunpoint. Two other suspects ransacked the spaza shop and stole cash, cigarettes and airtime vouchers before fleeing the scene. “At this stage, it is unknown whether a getaway vehicle was used and if the suspects are still at large,” Nkohli said.
