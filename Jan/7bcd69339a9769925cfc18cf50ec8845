MULALO Negondeni’s dreams are finally coming true. The talented 24-year-old from Mukula in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, has taken the first step towards building a real stadium! Earlier this month, Daily Sun published a story about how Mulalo had built a replica of FNB Stadium in his yard. At the time, he told the SunTeam he had never been to the stadium and relied on what he had seen on TV and in newspapers. Now the civil engineering student won’t have to worry about paying fees to continue studying for what he loves. Stadium Management South Africa has offered to pay for his studies. Mulalo has also been invited to travel to Soweto to watch a PSL match, along with three family members. CEO Jacques Grobbelaar said he was very impressed with Mulalo’s creativity. He said after speaking to him, he discovered he was a vibrant and enthusiastic young man. Mulalo said he was very happy to get an opportunity to visit the stadium. He said he wanted to use the opportunities given to him to build a stadium in his village.
