FOR most people January is a long month of struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table. But for madala David Selepe, it’s just like any other month. His best friend is Baile the dog, and Baile goes out into the veld and comes back with meat. The 85-year-old man from Breevoerte farm, near Marquard in the Free State takes his dog out during the day so he can hunt for rabbits. David said the meat is free and he can spend his money on other important things. “I grew up on a farm and my father was a shepherd. We used to spend a lot of time in the veld and wild meat was the only thing we ate while we were away,” said David. He said his dog was like a child to him and a security guard in the yard.
