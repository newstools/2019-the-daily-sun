Celebrity couple, Dineo Moeketsi and her fine bae, Zothile ‘Solo’ Langa have celebrated the seventh anniversary of their relationship in island style. The happy couple are on an undisclosed island for a romantic getaway that looks like it was taken out of a romcom. And since their vacation coincides with their anniversary, they are being extra romantic about it. Since being on the island, the lovebirds have been boat cruising, sun-bathing on the beaches and of course, celebrated their anniversary in a romantic, candle-lit dinner. Needless to say, Dineo has been serving fashion goals while on the trip serving us kimonos and rompers, plus a stunning orange, pleated maxi dress for the dinner. She has described the “unforgettable” getaway as her own slice of “heaven”. Solo on the other hand has been mostly topless; so much so that he even joked about not having forgotten his clothes at home. He even dropped what seems to be a hint onto his and Dineo’s family planning, calling the two of them “mom and dad”. Could a little bundle of joy be on the way? ?????? ...Golden Lady... ??????
