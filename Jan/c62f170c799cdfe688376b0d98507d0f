THE EFF in Limpopo wants Education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe to step down. The party made the call after the matric results were released and it emerged the province had performed poorly. Although Limpopo’s results had improved compared to previous years, the province still had the lowest pass rate in the country. EFF provincial chairman Jossey Buthane told Daily Sun the department could not pride itself on a percentage improvement while still sitting in the last spot. He said the party was worried that the department did not take education seriously. “It is disappointing that our leaders are busy looting the department through tenders instead of focusing on schools,” he said. “It worries us that the leadership is just the face of government while the department is led by outsiders.” He said if the province had at least produced a 70% pass rate, it would be something to celebrate. “Celebrating this poor achievement means we see no problem at all and this could prevent us from pulling up our socks,” he said. Buthane said the EFF wanted an MEC capable of running the department so pupils could pass. “Our province has proper schools and teachers but it’s a pity there is no proper leadership from the department,” he said. He said Limpopo would continue struggling if the provincial government ignored the call for the MEC to step down. Earlier, Kgetjepe said despite the province coming last in the country, he was happy the pass rate had improved by 3,8%. Limpopo registered a pass rate of 69,4%.
