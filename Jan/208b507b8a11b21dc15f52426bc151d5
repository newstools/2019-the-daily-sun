FARMERS in Qamata and surrounding areas have been thrown a lifeline. On Tuesday, the rural development department handed over new tractors and hay making machinery in the town near Cofimvaba. Officials, including acting Chris Hani mayor Sibongile Mbotshane, Chris Hani Development Agency chairwoman Nokulunga Skeyi, Eastern Cape Moral Regeneration Movement chairman Ngangomhlaba Matanzima and Intsika Yethu mayor Jongumzi Cengani attended. Farmer Malolo Qoko, who employs five people, said: “These tractors will make things easier and came at the right time.” Skeyi said they would bring progress, because jobs for machine operators would be available and fruit, grain and livestock production would increase. Matanzima told the people they should not damage what government provided and urged them to protect the tractors. “Our land helps fight poverty.” Rural development MEC Xolile Nqatha said: “We hope people will be united to fight hunger and not fight about tractors. “We want farmers to produce food and feed people,” he said.
