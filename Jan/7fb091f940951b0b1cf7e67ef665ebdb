DJ Zinhle and AKA have come a long way. The musicians, who are parents of three-year-old, Kairo Owethu Forbes have survived many trying times. Their much publicized split after rumours of AKA’s infidelity and secret relationship with Bonang Matheba came to the fore, was anything but nice. Things would get even nastier as more secrets came into the public sphere. Fast forward a couple of years, the pair have sparked rumours that they may have rekindled their romance. They both shared pictures on social media from what appears to be the same hotel. Fans have concluded that the pair are on a baecation and have expressed their disapproval of the reunion. Many of Zinhle’s fans have warned the DJ about getting back with her baby daddy, saying he will break her heart. However, others are more understanding and urge the DJ to follow her heart. Rumours of Zinhle and AKA’s reunion have been making the rounds ever since the rapper’s split with ex-girlfriend Bonang.
