  A
41-year-old man from Ga-Botha village in the Moutse West was struck by
lightning at his home. The
man was reportedly trying to move a speaker inside the house in the evening, as he was listening to music
inside the house while the other speaker was outside. Police
spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said when it started to rain heavily with
lightning, the man went outside to collect the speaker and that's when he got
struck by the lightning. “The
police and emergency medical services were called to the scene and they
responded immediately. Upon their arrival, the man was certified dead at the
scene,” he said. He
said the deceased was identified as Daniel Maapoga. Ngoepe
cautioned members of the community to be more alert during thunderstorms and
take necessary precautions, including taking shelter at safe places and
switching off electronic devices.
