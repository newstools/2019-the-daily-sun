Mzansi’s most famous hustler, Sibusiso ‘DJ Sbu’ Leope is once again being a good Samaritan and sharing his most prized knowledge on how to become successful. The radio DJ, businessman and all-round performer is looking to pay his own fame and fortune forward by letting his legions of fans in on some of his insights. Sbu has a couple of secrets to help make 2019 a super successful year and he is freely distributing it. All of his advice can be summed up in three simple steps, all of which speak to the power of outwardly expressing your goals, as opposed to keeping them locked away in the back of your mind. “1.Write down all goals you want to accomplish in 2019. 2. Go to your voice recorder. Record your goals in your voice saying "I am" "I have" present tense language. 3. Listen to your list at least an hour every night falling asleep into it instead of tv/radio,” he advised. “A dream written down with a date becomes a goal. A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. A plan backed by everyday action becomes a REALITY over time, that's if you don't give up along way when the going gets tough,” he continued. Sbu’s fans have thanked him for this and countless other words of advice that he has shared, with one fan going as far as to call his Twitter timeline a “blessing”.
