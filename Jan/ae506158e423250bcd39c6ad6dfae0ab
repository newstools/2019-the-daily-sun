MADALA MZIMAZISI Ndlovu wants the cows he paid for to in 2017. The 62-year-old from Hillbrow, Joburg, said he paid R7 200 for eight cows in August of that year but had still not received them. He told Daily Sun he made the purchase after seeing a pamphlet for a company selling cows at very low prices. He said he was convinced the company was legitimate. Mzimazisi said when the company was due to deliver, they told him he had to pay an extra R1 400 for insurance in case anything happened to the truck delivering the cows. “I had already spent too much so I decided to pay.” Mzimazisi said they promised to deliver the cows last January but when they were supposed to arrive, they told him the cows were sick. He said when he told them to deliver them anyway as he knew someone who could treat them, they refused. Mzimazisi said when he called the company again, no one answered and his number was later blocked. “I have not had peace since then. I just wanted to ensure my family was taken care of but they took advantage of me.” Daily Sun tried to get hold of the company but they evaded calls. Hillbrow police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said a case of fraud was being investigated.
