"I'm racist, I agree, judge me on that, it's
fine". These were the words of former Bosasa chief operation officer Angelo Agrizzi admitting being a
racist at the Zondo commission. Agrizzi has spent the last eight days at the Zondo commission giving testimony about how Bosasa allegedly paid millions of rand in bribes to top government officials in exchange for contracts. The zondo commission listened to a tape in which Agrizzi
was recorded making racial slurs, repeatedly. He told the commission that he knew they were recording
him but didn't know it was a trap. He said he would love the commission to hear the bad part
of the whole three hours of the clip which has never been played. Agrizzi said that his racist rant was directed towards
Gumede and Papa Leshabane. “Those two had made threats to me and towards my family. Yes,
I was wrong in expressing these sentiments, however, when people wrong you then
one may lose their cool,” he said. He said he made the statements in the privacy of his own
home. Judge Zondo asked him if that excuses his racism and Agrizzi
said he has no excuse. Said Agrizzi: "I was wrong and there's no excuse. When
people threaten you, you do stupid things. This is not an excuse.” Zondo told him that what “I have heard you say is totally
unacceptable but i will still examine your evidence property in the way a judge
should deal with it”. He says he think those who recorded him did so for their
own protection. Pretorius wants to clarify that he knew at the time he
was being recorded and that it was not something he realised with hindsight.
"I thought I could control it. Evidently I couldn't." LD Advocate Paul Pretorius, SC, told him that his remarks
are "nakedly racist and grossly offensive," said Agrizzi: "I'm
racist, I agree, judge me on that, it's fine". Agrizzi said he's paying the price for the remarks. “My children couldn't go to varsity, they had to work
from home,” he said.
