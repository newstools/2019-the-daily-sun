A 34-YEAR-old man was beaten and his shack was torched after he allegedly raped a 16-year-old girl on Saturday. The man allegedly took advantage of the girl after she was locked out of her house by her father because she returned home late. Residents from Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung, Free State claimed the man took the girl to a local tavern when he noticed she was stranded. They allegedly returned to his shack, where he raped her. Resident Leabua Tjemolane (37) told Daily Sun: “I was shocked when I heard the news. The man allegedly saw an opportunity to rape the girl at his shack when he saw that she was vulnerable.” Leabua said the girl complained to residents and her parents that she was raped. “Residents came together and hunted the man down. He was found in one of the local taverns boozing. Residents moered him and he pleaded with them not to kill him. Cops were called, but the residents went to his shack and burned it down,” he said. Another resident, Mantwa Lesia, said: “I am happy the man was arrested. This is scary because I also have two girls and I worry about what could happen to them. “There are a lot of prostitutes not far from where he lives. He should have gone there to buy sex instead of raping an innocent child. He must never set foot in our kasi when he comes out of jail.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said a case of rape was opened. The suspect will appear in court soon.
