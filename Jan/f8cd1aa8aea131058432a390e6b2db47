WHILE most people took time off and relaxed during the holidays, newly trained cops were working around the clock to make sure people were safe. Now that the holidays are over, they are taking a well-deserved break. The 594 constables who completed their basic training at the Tshwane Police Academy last year arrived in KZN before Christmas. They will have two weeks off before reporting to their stations. When the constables arrived in KZN, provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi sent them to hot spots across the province to beef up capacity over the festive season. They worked tirelessly and most holiday makers felt protected as cops were visible everywhere. Nomkhosi Khanyile (35) from G section, KwaMashu, north of Durban said they did a great job to keep the peace during the festive season and deserved their break. “Thugs didn’t do as they pleased because cops were all over. I hope they remain visible, especially after the holiday season,” she said. On Monday in Chatsworth, Durban, Mkhwanazi urged the constables to be disciplined. “Always be reminded of the Constitution because it makes provision for our presence in society. Treat residents with respect, for we exist because of them,” he said. He thanked them for sacrificing their family time to serve the province’s citizens.
