AFTER a robbery at Menzi Primary School, it emerged that a security door was left unlocked and a smart board wasn’t switched off. The thugs took 185 tablets, eight laptops, three desktop computers, two projectors, a TV, a digital video recorder and petty cash. Now parents at the school in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, believe someone at the school is working with the thugs. They said they believed the smart board in a grade 7 classroom was left on so the thugs would know which classroom to go into. School patroller Themba Kobane, who was tied up by the thugs on Monday night, said the robbers said they would return for more smart boards. “We were sitting in the guard room when seven men with their faces covered pounced on us. They took us to the staff room, tied us up and took our cellphones. We were found by our colleagues at about 4am on Tuesday morning,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the value of the stolen goods was still not known. A case of business robbery was opened. Ramphora appealed to the community to help the police find the suspects.
