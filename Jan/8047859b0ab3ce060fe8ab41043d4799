PHOTOS of school children who were involved in an accident have left people divided. The photos circulated on social media showed the pupils lying face down at the scene of the accident. The accident appears to have happened in Rockville, Soweto yesterday morning. The eight children were injured following a collision between a school transport vehicle and a Rea Vaya bus. But people were not pleased that the photos were shared on social media. While a lot of people were against the photos being circulated, others felt it was necessary as it was a quick way to spread the news. “The only thing that we can say is to pray for their recovery, nothing else. At least now you know that the children were involved in an accident.” According to EMS paramedics 15 people with minor to moderate injuries were treated on the scene. The injured were taken to hospitals. MMC of Transport, Nonhlanhla Makhuba, urged drivers to be extra cautious and obey the rules of the road at all times.
