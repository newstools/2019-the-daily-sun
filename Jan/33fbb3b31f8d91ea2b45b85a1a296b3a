ALL Thulani Ndzotyana ever wanted was to positively change other people’s lives. And the dream of the 20-year-old from Nelson Mandela Bay in Eastern Cape was realised when she was crowned Miss Sundowns last year. This gave her the platform to start working on the Kicks with Goals and The Helping Hand initiatives last February. “I did not want to be just a pretty face behind the crown. I want to make a difference,” she said. Thulani gets shoes from people and donates them to the poor. She is also sponsored by sports brand Puma, which donated 15 pairs of tekkies last month. Thulani said she gives them to kids at schools when she does motivational talks. “We don’t just give them away but encourage pupils to get educated so they don’t rely on handouts all their lives. They need a push in the right direction.” Thulani said she also gives food parcels to random people and wants to touch people’s hearts through her work. “I need people to know that no matter how tough you think your life is, there’s always someone who has to face challenges even tougher than yours,” she said.
