GATVOL parents closed down a crumbling school. They barricaded the entrance to Manyakana Primary School in Newington, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Thursday. More than 552 pupils, 15 teachers, three general workers and two guards were left with no option but to return home. The protesters later marched down the road and closed Agincourt School. They said it would remain closed until their demands were met. They are demanding that the Mpumalanga Department of Education builds a new school. School Governing Body chairman Raymond Tibane said: “The department promised to build a school in 2013. “This school is now a death trap, as part of the roof of the classroom was blown off by a violent storm in 2011. “The walls have terrible cracks which could crumble and crush our kids.” Tibane said the department only provided them with six mobile classrooms and promised it would only be for six months, as they were busy with budget allocations. His secretary, Phumzile Mkhonto, said recent rains soaked the stationery and textbooks, as well as the computers in the administration block. Department spokesman Gerald Sambo said they were still waiting for a report from the district office.
