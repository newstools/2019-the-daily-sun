WORKERS from three pineapple farms in Hluhluwe, northern KZN, have vowed not to return to work until their demands are met. About 360 workers started protesting for better working conditions on Monday. Zuthulise Mqadi, general secretary of Abanqobi Workers Union, said workers had been complaining about the same problems since 1993. Among other things, they wanted to be employed permanently as they’d been temps for years. “They don’t even have benefits such as provident funds, bonuses or overtime pay.” Mqadi said the workers were angry as they had come to realise they were being mistreated by their employers. Farm owner Johnny Dinsteden said: “We’re not bad farmers. We do allow them to go home early on some of the days, and we also give them bonuses when we can. “In December I gave them R500 each on top of their normal pay.” Daily Sun couldn’t get comment from the other farmers.
