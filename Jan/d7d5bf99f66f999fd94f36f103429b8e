If you are a jazz fan, your year will start on a sour note as the best jazz spot is closing down. The place has hosted jazz artist from all over mzansi and has given a platform to up-and-coming jazz musicians. The Orbit was opened in 2014, and it hosted artists such as Msaki, Sipho Hotstix Mabuse, Tlale Makhene and Max-Hoba got a chance to perform their music at the Orbit last year. On Thursday the jazz joint released a statement stating that the place will be closing down due to financial constraints. The statement reads: “It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of The Orbit Lve Music and Bistro. We have unfortunately not been able to overcome the financial constraints that we have found with running a live music venue like The Orbit. We had hoped to attract more investment but has proven difficult with the type of business that we are and the current financial realities in the country.” In their statement, they continued to thank the people who supported the venue over the years and the staff member. It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of The Orbit. Thank you for all the support over the years. A post shared by  The Orbit - Home of Jazz (@orbitjazz) on Jan 3, 2019 at 3:17am PST
