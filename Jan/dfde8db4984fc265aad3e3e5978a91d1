No injuries were recorded but their houses were damaged.” Dlamini said according to their information, about 150 households were affected. “We are working closely with all ward councillors to help all affected families and get the details of the family members of the person killed by lightning.” KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said they sent the disaster management team to the area to assist all affected families. “We have sent teams to help people who are homeless and in need. They are on the ground and doing their best, even though conditions are difficult. “We appeal to residents to immediately call leaders nearby, like councillors, amakhosi, community development workers and izinduna, to receive immediate help. ” Dube-Ncube warned people to be careful as this weather is expected to continue. “In KZN, summer is when we experience scorching temperatures that suddenly are replaced by violent storms and lightning,” she said.
