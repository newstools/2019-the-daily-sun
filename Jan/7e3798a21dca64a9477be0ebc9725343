FORMER Bosasa Chief Financial Officer Andries van Tonder Bosasa has told the commission of how the company paid him R20 000 per month to shut up. Van Tonder said the R20k was in addition to his normal salary. He said Gavin Watson himself would give the money to him every month. "I received it over a period of... if I can recall right, it started in 2005,” Van Tonder said. On the issue of money for bribes, he said the cash was generated by creating fraudulent documents to request cash. He says the requests were justified by contracting SMMEs, who didn’t have bank accounts and then after claim that the money was used to pay them. Van Tonder confirmed to the commission that he filmed the video in which Watson was seen counting stacks of cash intended for bribes. According to him, he would take cash from the company secretary's vault, to Watson's vault, whenever Watson requested. He added that he did not keep a record of all the cash he deposited into the Bosasa safe. Van Tonder further confirmed that the cash would be delivered in a sealed, brown carton box. The former CFO confirmed to the commission that Blakes Travel was used to make travel arrangements for high ranking government officials. He says Watson instructed him and Agrizzi at some point to destroy incriminating documents at Blakes Travel. Van Tonder pointed out how documents would be taken to a nearby site, dumped in a big hole and then they would burn them. He said the hole was filled again after burning the documents, and then covered with concrete.
