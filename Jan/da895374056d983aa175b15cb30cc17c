President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated the Matric
Class of 2018 for keeping the National Senior Certificate (NSC) pass rate above
70%. He said this achievement underscores the importance of
learners, educators, families, administrators and political leadership working
together. “As South Africans, we can all take pride in the
dedication shown by learners and educators. Together, they have presented our
nation with another cohort of young people whose life chances have been
significantly enhanced, and whose success in basic education is indeed
reversing the damage inflicted on generations of South Africans who were
deprived of quality education under apartheid," said  Ramaphosa. The Class of 2018 was the fourth large cohort in the
history of basic education to register for any NSC examination. Ramaphosa said this illustrated the impact of
government’s support to poor learners and their families. “This support spans pro-poor funding of schools; the
provision of nutritious meals on a daily basis; and the provision of scholar
transport to deserving learners on daily basis. “These interventions have led to increased levels of
retention of learners and enabled their success in the National Senior
Certificate examinations,” said Ramaphosa. The President has urged matriculants to show
responsibility in exploring opportunities in higher education, vocational
training or workplace experience, and to adopt the understanding that learning
is and should be a lifelong endeavour. Ramaphosa has also encouraged learners who did not pass
to make use of Second Chance programmes and to believe in their ability to
overcome this challenge as one of many that will bring out the best in them
during the course of their lives.
