TWELVE years ago, Kamohelo Malefetsane (18) made a promise to himself that he would make his grandmother and great-grandmother proud. Yesterday he delivered, passing six of his subjects with distinction. Daily Sun visited the Malefetsane family in Sebokeng in the Vaal, south of Joburg. When Mamolefe Malefetsane heard the great news, she broke down in tears and gave her great- grandson a big kiss. Kamohelo said he was very happy that he had passed. “I couldn’t have done it without the support and the great efforts of my grandmother and great-grandmother,” he said. Kamohelo said seeing their happiness brings everlasting joy to his heart. “My elders were always my motivation. Even when I was about to lose faith in myself, they always encouraged me to do better next time,” he said. Kamohelo said he always wanted to study accounting and his great marks have given him hope. “Life has become real. I still have a long way to go to make my family happy,” he said. Gogo Malefetsane said she has no words to express her joy. “My great-grandson always promised me he would prove himself to me,” she said. Malefetsane’s mathematics teacher at Esokwazi Secondary School in Sebokeng, Potso Mokwena, said for the past three years they have been tops in maths. “It makes me happy to see our learners maintaining the scores to motivate those coming to the next grade to lift the bar higher,” he said.
