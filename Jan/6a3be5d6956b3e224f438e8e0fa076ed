The flyer of Coachella’s lineup was
released, and it took social media by storm. He demanded that the Coachella team should
fix things quickly because he didn’t like how his name was written so tiny.
Burna Boy complained about the size of the font used when written his name. On a poster that he later deleted reads:
“@coachella I really appreciate you. But I don’t appreciate the way my name is
written. So small in your bill. I am an AFRICAN GIANT and will not be reduced
to whatever that tiny writing means. Fix things Some
of his Twitter fans salute him for knowing his worth, while some think he is
just being too much and made him a new flyer with only his name on it  AJ | Adonai Jonathan‏ @Mrmanhere_ 7h7 hours ago More Funny thing about this burna boy Coachella
story is that a lot of people bashing him have clearly misunderstood what he
said. Burna said ‘I’m an African giant’ not ‘I am the only African
giant’. But because you don’t like him, you feel the need to come online to
bash him.  PAPA FUÈTE‏ @The_Papafuete 8h8 hours ago More Burna boy is fighting for how big he sees
himself, And y'all can't relate because you don't even have self esteem. Sad.  JJ.

Omojuwa Retweeted Tersoo T-Rexx Abaagu I agree with Burna Boy 100%! And this isn’t
about Burna himself, this is about the culture this side of the world.
Wiz refused to collect an award because presentation would be backstage. The
following year, Davido collected it on stage. These are necessary battles!  Ngozi.‏ @BiggieMonzie 8h8 hours ago More Coachella should remove Burna Boy and put
Skibii because the whole world needs to hear the masterpiece that is
"Sensima".  Doc C‏ @tweetMOPOL 8h8 hours ago More Please don't compare Burna Boy to wizkid.
Wizkid fought for African acts, Burna Boy is fighting due to
pride. If the small fonts were reserved for just Africans, I would have agreed
with his point. There are ppl bigger than him with smaller fonts. Rest
