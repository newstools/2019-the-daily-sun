SERVICES are expected to improve at Site C Youth Clinic in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. This is because the clinic received new equipment from ward 86 councillor, Mlulami Velem yesterday. Facility manager Nonkosi Ngingi told Daily Sun the equipment, which included a bed, a scanner to check for high blood pressure as well as a dressing trolley, are exactly what they need. “We are so happy as the ones we were using were old and always gave us problems.” Dr Virginia Azevedo told the People’s Paper the equipment came at the right time and they were happy the councillor heard their plea and came to the rescue. “Our patients won’t have to go to other facilities to get quality services because they can get them here,” said Azevedo. Velem said they were always on the lookout to help where they can, and they would continue to do so. “The lives of the people are important so we used the allocated money to improve service,” said Velem.
