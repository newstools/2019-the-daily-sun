A group of magoshas have allegedly been robbing old men, by luring them to an unused church yard on Groom Street in Verulam, KwaZulu Natal. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) spokesperson Prem Balram they have attended to several of these cases over the festive season, Balram says several madalas were robbed of cash, watches and other valuables. “Some of the victims were lured from Wick Street, in Verulam to the abandoned church yard - after they were promised sexual intercourse and oral sex,” Balram said. After they arrive at the abandoned church, the men would then be approached by drug users, who wait in a temporary structure. The victims would reportedly then be robbed at knife-point and assaulted. “Other victims are approached by the two females and robbed. The woman recently forcefully removed R1000 in cash from a pensioner. This after they accused him of failing to pay for sexual services,” Balram added. The women were eventually arrested by Reaction officers on Tuesday, after a victim spotted them. According to RUSA, the women were released as the victims had not opened criminal cases.
