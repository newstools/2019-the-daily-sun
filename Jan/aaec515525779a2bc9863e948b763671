LIMPOPO police need the community’s help to find two missing people. Mologadi Kgasago (50), a mentally disabled woman from Matatane Village outside Lebowakgomo, left home on 15 December without informing anyone, while Silas Nemapakoni (37) from Mulodi Village outside Thohoyandou, went missing on 24 December after he left Joburg on his way home. But searches for the two people yielded fruitless results. According to provincial cop spokeswoman Constable Maphure Manamela, police investigations revealed that Mologadi was last seen in Mphaaneng Village on 15 December. “According to the information we received, it is not the first time Mologadi went missing. “She is mentally challenged and allegedly left home in the morning without informing anyone where she was going. Intensive searches by police, relatives and villagers were not successful. Efforts to find the missing woman continue,” said Manamela. She said anyone with information on the woman’s whereabouts should contact Captain Matsobane Chuene on 082 414 3345 or call 08600 10111. Meanwhile, police in Mutale outside Thohoyandou launched a search operation after Silas went missing. He was reported missing by his brother, who told the police that Silas called on 24 December from Midrand, outside Joburg informing the family he was coming home. “Unfortunately, Silas never arrived home,” said Manamela. Anyone with information should call 015 967 8000.
