RESIDENTS from Ilitha Park in Khayelitsha are gatvol of paying for water they don’t use. They took their anger to the streets on Tuesday afternoon as they marched to Stocks and Stocks’ offices in Khayelitsha. Residents accused the city of Cape Town of installing water meters that rob them. Mkhuseli Joba (45) said: “Since these were installed last year, we have had to pay lots of money but we can’t do that anymore.” He said many people receive high bills. One resident showed officials a disconnected broken meter that still clocked up use despite being disconnected. Bishop Derrick Mtsolo told Daily Sun: “We are tired of being billed for what we didn’t use, being billed without meters, drinking dirty water and unwarranted water disconnections. Enough is enough. “Some owe over R100 000. “Where did this come from and who wants that money?” Residents burnt tyres and blocked roads in anger. Mtsolo said they weren’t going to allow any more connections. Nosisi Nxusani (56) said in 15 years she’s never paid over R1 000 but now owes R15 700. Manager of revenue Bertram Arendse accepted the memorandum, promising to investigate.
