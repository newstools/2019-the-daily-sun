BENEFICIARIES were frustrated last week after they were turned away from Sassa’s office in Mbumbulu. According to residents, Sassa in the south of eThekwini was without electricity for the whole week. They said each time they went there, security guards turned them away. Only those collecting or dropping off application forms were helped. When the SunTeam visited the office on Friday, guards confirmed there was no power. The previous day, the office was open but there were few workers there and residents complained they didn’t get help. Goodness Maphumulo (57) wanted to renew her pension grant but was turned away. She said it broke her heart because she desperately needed to renew the grant, which expired at the beginning of the month. “I went to enquire and was told I needed to renew it. I didn’t have transport money, so couldn’t come earlier. Now that I have the money, I can’t get help. “The guards didn’t even tell me when the problem would be resolved. I used my food money and now I’ll suffer. I don’t have food.” Gcinile Mkhize (54) said she only had to drop off a form, so wasn’t affected. “But a lot of people couldn’t get help. The department should do something about this.” Social development spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said: “We aren’t sure why the power was out but Eskom said it would fix it today.”
