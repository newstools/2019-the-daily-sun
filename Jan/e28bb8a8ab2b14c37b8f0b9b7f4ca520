EFF leader Julius Malema believes the ANC died with Nelson Mandela, Robert Sobukwe, Steve Biko and others. “Today’s life is not the democracy that people fought for,” said Malema. “Voters must do the right thing and vote for a better life. “Mandela and others didn’t go through hardships for these matchbox houses people are living in.” He said people needed houses like those given to poor white people during apartheid. Malema said the water in Hammanskraal was dirty. “Children are ill and dying from drinking dirty water in Hammanskraal, but people still continue chasing after T-shirts and food parcels from the ANC,” he said. He said Hammanskraal needed a water plant. “I’m not carrying T-shirts and food parcels, but I brought the truth. I will die with my conscience intact,” he said. He said owning land was not only about agriculture – that there are minerals such as gold, diamonds and platinum which people could benefit from. Malema said deputy ministers’ positions must be done away with. He said departments such as sports and arts and culture, as well as health and social development, must be combined.
