FOR several years gogo Deliwe Nzuza (77) relied on her dog to protect her from thieves. But the dog that served as the only form of proection for gogo Deliwe from Obonjeni, northern KZN, will now have little work to do. On Friday, Councillor Sibonelo Mathenjwa got local businessman to build the gogo a three-roomed house. Gogo Deliwe said she always dreamt of owning a house that would make her feel safe. “I thank the ward councillor and his friends for practising ubuntu. Several years ago I lost all my children and I was left with no one to look after me. “I bought a dog that turned into my friend and guardian angel. “He always sits next to me when I’m in the yard. When I’m in the house he stays right at the door step. “I thank God for the kind bond he created between me and my dog,” said the gogo. She said she was happy she could sleep in a house that will give her dignity. “I could see the sky when I was sleeping in my old house. On rainy days I would wake up and stand in the corner and wait for the storm to pass. Rain used to leak through the roof and walls. “I am over the moon because now I will sleep peacefully in my new house.” Mathenjwa said: “It is my job to lend a helping hand to the residents of my ward. “I was moved by the gogo’s plight, so I decided to get my friends on board. “I am thankful to them for providing such assistance.”
