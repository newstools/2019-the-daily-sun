A GREAT white shark spoiled the festive season for Eastern Cape beachgoers. Two weeks ago Ndlambe Municipality closed all the beaches in Port Alfred after fishermen spotted a shark at West Beach. Director of community protection services Nombulelo Booysen-Willy instructed lifeguards at East Beach and Kelly’s Beach to close them until further notice. “Lifeguards are patrolling the beaches to ensure they are safe for swimmers to return to the water. “Shark experts will be sent to monitor the situation.” The man from Tshwane was visiting his brother in Port Elizabeth. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said: “Two brothers went fishing and were caught in a current. “At about 10.30am the one brother managed to swim to the shore. “A passerby on the beach noticed that the other brother was in trouble and went into the sea to pull him out of the water. “They immediately performed CPR but he passed away. “The brother who survived was taken to hospital for a check up.”
