TWO more Joburg Metro cops were arrested for corruption yesterday. The cops, a man and a woman, were part of a group of six officers who were served with notices of intent to suspend them. They allegedly demanded a R20 000 bribe from a foreign shop owner, who was accused of making fake IDs. Metro cops spokesman Wayne Minnaar said two women cops were called by a member of the public who was allegedly not happy with a fake ID received from the shop owner. Minnaar said the two cops called the other four officers and they all went to the shop and demanded a R20 000 bribe from the shop owner. The owner gave the cops R5 000. But he then laid a complaint with Metro copsâ€™ internal affairs about the incident which took place on 2 January. Three of the six cops were arrested last Thursday. The two cops arrested yesterday were bust by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.
