The G12 BMW 7 Series has been around for more than 3 years
and in BMW's world that meant it was up for a Life Cycle Impulse. And like it has been recently with BMW their face-lifts have
a lot to do with their signature kidney grille. So the G12 LCI brings X7-like
kidney grilles which are huge, 40% larger to be precise. That grille is flanked
by slimmer, redesigned adaptive LED headlights. BMW Laserlight technology with selective beams can be fitted
as an option. The front bumper has also been given a few touches to bring it up
to date. The front-end is 50mm taller. The LCI doesn't stop with the front end and its big grille,
look around the car you'll notice subtle changes around the car's exterior. For
example, BMW has redesigned the "hockey stick" front air vents on the
sides. The vents are now more upright, the whole design looks a lot
less like a hockey stick. The rear gets a new light strip that runs across the entire
back. That light strip is neatly integrated into the newly redesigned rear
lights which now have a 3-D design and are 35mm slimmer. Inside the Nappa leather gets extended quilting, there are
new wood trims and ambient lighting. The new 7-Series also gets BMW's Live
Cockpit Professional with a Navigation system, a fully digital, 12.3-inch
instrument cluster and 10.25-inch Control Display as seen on the new 8-Series
and X5. The system is run by BMW's Operating System 7.0. The new OS comes with BMW Intelligent Personal which is
controlled by natural voice commands. The side windows have been made thicker
so you and your assistant can get a more quiet space to talk. The engine line-up remains the same, but all engines have
been updated to meet the latest Euro regulations.
