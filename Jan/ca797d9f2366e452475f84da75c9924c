THE R20 an hour national minimum wage came into effect yesterday. The rate does not immediately apply to domestic workers, nannies and farmworkers, and it will kick in gradually over time. Meanwhile, domestic workers have to be paid at least R15 an hour and farmworkers R18. Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the national minimum wage at a ceremony in Kliptown, Soweto. He said it was a good start towards a living wage. In his New Year’s message, Ramaphosa said last year was a year in which they focused on employment and were determined to create new opportunities for all South Africans. “This is the result of many decades of tireless struggle and is a powerful demonstration of the shared determination of all partners to tackle poverty and inequality,” he said. Domestic workers who shared their views with Daily Sun had mixed feelings about being paid R15 an hour. Lindiwe Zulu (45) from Randburg, Joburg, said she works nine hours a day, Monday to Thursday. She said she clocks in at 6am and knocks off at 3pm. “I’m grateful that with the kind of work we do, at least we were considered. “I’ve been a domestic worker all my life and it’s the only job I know. “I raised my daughter, who’ll be in matric with the money I earn. And it’s been difficult.” Lindiwe’s employer said she was more than happy to pay this amount.
