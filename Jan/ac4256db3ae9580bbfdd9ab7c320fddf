BOOZERS and loud music give neighbours of illegal shebeens sleepless nights. But over the past month, the CPF in Meadowlands, Soweto, has been trying to restore peace to the area by closing down places selling booze illegally. On Saturday, members of the CPF and cops destroyed all the booze they had confiscated as part of the operation. As beer was being poured down the drain, some residents could be heard complaining that it was a waste. Meadowlands police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Thebe confirmed illegal booze had been confiscated and destroyed. “The booze was taken from shebeens that do not comply with the law,” she said.
