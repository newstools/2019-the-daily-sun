THOMAS Sebopela wants to set the record straight! He told Daily Sun that he is no sugar daddy! Following an article published on 11 July 2017, Thomas has contacted the People’s Paper to make things clear. Thomas said Mantso Semelane wasn’t just a random woman he picked up on the side of the road. He said they were dating and they decided to live together because he spends his time on the road as a truck driver and he needed someone to look after his two children. Thomas, from Rabie Ridge, near Tembisa in Ekurhuleni said: “My wife died in 2015. A year later I decided to find a woman to marry and also to help take care of my kids. Someone I know told me about a single woman in Lesotho. Arrangements were made for her to come to South Africa and we agreed to date,” said Thomas. Mantsho was 28 and Thomas was 59 when they met. Thomas said they had disagreements like any other couple, but he wasn’t home when Mantso decided to pack her bags and leave. “I discovered she took the money and my daughter’s suitcase when I got home,” said Thomas. A case of theft was opened with the police. But Rabie Ridge police spokesman Captain Mofana Masela said the case was struck off the court roll due to lack of evidence.
