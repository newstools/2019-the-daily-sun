HIP-HOP DJ Junior De Rocka is hopeful that he and the mother of his child will “find common ground” and resolve their problems. The DJ and his ex-girlfriend Ntando Duma were top of the trending list on Twitter a few days ago after they aired the issues in public. Duma accused her baby daddy Junior De Rocka of being a deadbeat dad.Needless to say, the DJ denied the allegations and went on to set the record straight, posting proof that he does indeed take care of his child. However, Junior is still hopeful that the pair will find an amicable solution soon. “I'll never do that. That's the mother of my child. We will eventually find common ground,” he replied to a fan who suggested he take Duma to court. “Me going to courts to hurt her won’t make our situation any better n that's just how I feel.”
