He obtained distinctions in maths, life sciences, physics, life orientation, geography and religious studies Robert told Daily Sun he was planning to study astrophysics at Wits University this year. “I’m so excited. I haven’t slept for days . I didn’t know how good my pass would be. I was worried about maths and science,” he said. “I’m happy that I survived the worry! Another top achiever, Lindokuhle Sithole (17) from Lefa Ifa Secondary in KwaThemba, Ekurhuleni, got four distinctions. “It’s been hard studying this year because I had to share the small house with my siblings,” he said. “I had to study when I was not doing house chores.” He said extra classes at the school helped him a lot. “I thank God for making me ace it,” said the happy young man. But not everybody will be smiling. Some will be shedding tears. Dina Molemo, motivational speaker, urged matrics who failed not to give up and go back to finish their studies. “Many will be dropping out because they are ashamed to be laughed at by their peers,” said Dina. “We urge them to go back!” She said matrics now have other platforms to complete their matric studies.
