Owami is following in the footsteps of her dad, kwaito king Arthur Mafokate! But the 17-year-old house DJ has taken a slightly different music direction to her famous dad, who usually accompanies her to events. She said being a DJ has not changed her, and that she remains a humble, respectful girl. Owami said like other girls, she spent a lot of time with friends and even took them along to gigs. “I want to produce music, release my own album, and become a businesswoman in the future,” she said. Owami counted herself lucky because she got to spin the decks at big gigs during peak slots, even though she was new in the game. “I will be doing matric this year, and although I’m always busy school is my priority.” Owami said she has been on the decks since she was 13. She started taking it seriously last year when she was on YoTV during Women’s Month in August. “It opened doors for me, and that’s when I started getting bookings and performing across the country.” She said she was bringing something special to the music industry and was keen on learning the tricks of the trade. Her dad Arthur told SunBuzz seeing his daughter doing wonders on stage made him emotional. “She is just unbelievable,” he said. “As much as I preferred her not to be an artist, people always expected it and I think those expectations somehow worked on her and she automatically fell into it and is doing well.” Arthur said Owami can still improve as she needs to do more gigs to gain experience, but the fact that people embrace her music made him happy. Owami’s mum, former kwaito star Queen Sesoko, was the front lady of music group Abashante. Her kwaito king dad was the group’s producer, through his record label 999 Music.
