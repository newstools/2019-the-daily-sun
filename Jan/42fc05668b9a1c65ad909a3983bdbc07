RESIDENTS of Vhembe have learned with shock of an attempt on the life of unionist Timmy Tshililo. Tshililo, a senior official at the South African Municipal Workers Union, has been vocal about the VBS Mutual Bank scandal. He has also led campaigns against corruption in the Vhembe Municipality in Limpopo. According to police, the 50-year-old was shot by an unknown person who waited for him outside the gate of his house at about 8pm on Thursday. The suspect fled the scene and Tshililo was rushed to hospital. He is not the first union official to be targeted for speaking against corruption and the looting of the bank. Last year, Limpopo secretary Patrick Aphane’s house in Ga-Kgobokwane Village, outside Marble Hall, was shot at just after he had walked in. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the motive for the shooting was still unclear, but would be part of investigations. He called on residents who might have information about the shooting to come forward. Mojapelo said the case was receiving priority attention and provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba had already established a task team to investigate the matter. “Anyone with information about this incident is requested to contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or 08600 10111. “Police investigations are continuing,” Mojapelo said.
