GRIEVING relatives, friends and colleagues said their final goodbyes to Tshepiso Moremi on Saturday. On Friday Daily Sun published a story about the cold-blooded murder of the 19-year-old from Kagisanong View near Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane. Tshepiso’s mum, Mokgadi Moremi (46), said the teenager and her friends were on their way back from a shop when four men attacked and robbed them. “According to her friends, the men forced them to lie on the ground and demanded their phones and money. “But before they left, one of them shot Tshepiso and ran away,” said Mokgadi. Family representative Moloko Molefe said they always thought Tshepiso had a bright future ahead of her. “We were left with an unfinished story. “Her matric results are due early next year,” said Moloko. Her friend Rebaona Ditlhareng said Tshepiso was a good girl. “Tshepiso loved computers a lot. She wanted to study IT,” she said. One of the speakers said it was time the community did something about crime. “We need to work hand in hand with the police to stop this,” he said. Tshepiso was buried at Rockville Cemetery.
