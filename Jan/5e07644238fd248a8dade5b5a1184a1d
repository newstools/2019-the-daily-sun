FOOTBALL can be a cruel game! That is the feeling that Kaizer Chiefs supporters left the FNB Stadium with as Cape Town City did a smash and grab in their Absa Premiership encounter at the FNB Stadium last night. Amakhosi did about everything to win their league game, but still ended the evening on the losing side. City rode their luck to end their bogey over Chiefs with a 1-0 victory to continue their rich vein of form. Edmilson Dove grabbed the winner 12 minutes from time to help the Citizens collect 30 points from 18 matches to hold onto their fourth position on the log. Amakhosi could have easily buried the Citizens but they missed an avalanche of chances. However, when the opportunity to score presented itself, City grabbed it with both hands as they clinched the three points to punish the wasteful Amakhosi, who have no one but themselves to blame for the loss. City ended the game with ten men when Zukile Kewuti was shown a red card towards the end of the game, his dismissal did not affect the score line though. Chiefs tore the Citizens into shreds with a 4-1 hiding at the Cape Town Stadium in their first round meeting, but City gained a good measure of revenge. The Mother City based outfit came into this encounter as the form team, but Amakhosi had the upper hand against them with three victories, a draw and just one defeat in their past five meetings, but City changed all that with a surprise victory in their sixth league meeting. Peter Leeuwenburgh stood between Chiefs with his string of fantastic saves to keep them at bay in both halves.
