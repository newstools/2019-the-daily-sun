WHEN Benjamin Kunene’s phone beeped, he was shocked to find an SMS stating he had earned himself more than R2 million. The 60-year-old immediately called the number attached to the message, which stated the money would be cleared if he deposited R1 150. But it turned out to be a scam. Now, Benjamin is poorer and not a millionaire. He said he was told after the deposit cleared cash would be delivered to his house. He was told to stash his bank card in a bucket of mielie-meal before going to bed. The madala from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: “I was told the money would pile up in my house. I woke up every hour to check if the money was in the house, but in the morning there was nothing.” He said when he realised he had been scammed, he tried to open a case with the Duduza police but was told cops could do nothing as he deposited the money voluntarily. Benjamin is now sitting with only an SMS to remind him of his bad luck. When asked what he would have done with the money, he said he wanted to buy a taxi to transport kids to school and to open a tuck shop. “I had big dreams about that money. Sadly, I was taken for a ride. I’ll never do it again and my advice to others: Do not to fall for the trick.” Captain Johannes Ramphora said the public must check individuals and companies’ details before sending money.
