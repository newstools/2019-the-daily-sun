ANGRY train commuters have expressed their frustration after they were left stranded at Koedoespoort Train Station in Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, yesterday. They claimed they were told by the train operator that their shifts ended there and that they won’t be going any further. The commuters came from different parts of Mamelodi and were heading to the Tshwane CBD. Some were going to work while others were going to school. They said they paid the same amount that took them from their local train station to town. The commuters claimed this was not the first time they were told their train would not go to town and needed to make alternative arrangements. Minah Kheswa (38) said using the train felt everyday abuse. She said if she had enough money, she would use the bus or taxi. “It’s one drama after another with these trains. We have to pray every day that everything runs smoothly,” she said. Gauteng Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said there was a faulty train in the Mamelodi corridor. “Another train was dispatched to collect commuters. We apologised for the delays and inconvenience caused,” she said.
