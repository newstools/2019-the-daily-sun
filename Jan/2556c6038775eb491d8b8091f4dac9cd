MADALA Leepile Simon (74) has a double headache about a duplicated document and he has appealed to Home Affairs to fix it. Leepile, from Constantia in Kroonstad, has two different marriage certificates although he has been married once. He separated from his wife 20 years ago, but they did not get divorced. Later, he got himself a new lover. “I agreed with my second partner that I was going to marry her, but I needed to divorce first,” Leepile told Daily Sun. His partner arrived with a man who they claimed was from Home Affairs at their home. They gave him Leepile’s ID to check his marital status. “My ID was returned after two days in 2011. Last month I got the shock of my life when I found two marriage certificates in my drawer,” he said. Leepile said his partner does not give him clear answers about how they are now legally married. “I’ve never signed any document or got married to anyone except my first wife. Home Affairs must tell me what happened.” Much to madala’s joy, Home Affairs has brought him relief. Home Affairs provincial manager Bonakele Mayekiso said: “The first marriage was not registered on the system. Hence the second marriage took place. “The officer did not check the registration book. “The second marriage certificate has since been cancelled.”
