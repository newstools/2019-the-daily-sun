Locally-renowned DJ, Shimza has made a call for sponsorship in aid of an up and coming DJ. The founder of the very successful charity event, One Man Show, is taking the show to Paris, France later this year. As part of the Paris edition of the show, Shimza wants to open up the industry by giving an up and coming House music DJ the opportunity to prove that he/she has what it takes to shine on an international stage. But first, he needs the finances to make it happen. “Looking for a sponsor to fund a talented and upcoming house DJ who will be an opening act for my One Man Show in Paris,” Shimza tweeted. The DJ, whose real name is Ashley Raphala, has been very vocal about the fact that aspiring DJs have a tough time making it in Mzansi because people are not willing to take a risk and invest in them. ICYMI: SHIMZA TO TAKE HIS ONE MAN SHOW ABROAD In a recent interview with TshisaLive, Shimza said that it is usually the top-rated musicians who receive financial backing. He told the publications that even music lovers are only willing to buy tickets to see the biggest acts we have. “The model is people pay for the big names. At the end of the day we want to sell a product that people will want.... It's all good and well to want to put upcoming artists on the lineup but the model says people pay and buy tickets for the big names.  We want to get the masses there and then introduce those we can introduce at that point,” he said. Fans have applauded the DJ for wanting to create more opportunities for aspiring DJs and have heeded his call for them to raise awareness. Shimza will stage his One Man Show, Paris Edition on the 12th of April 2019.
