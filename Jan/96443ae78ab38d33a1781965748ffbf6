WITH the passing on of former Bafana Bafana sharpshooter Phil “Chippa” Masing, Safa president Danny Jordaan will meet with the SA Football Players Union to discuss the role that agents/intermediaries play in the lives of soccer players. In a subtle and veiled reference, Jordaan took a pot shot at players’ agents and said it wasn’t about the players who have died, but about those who are living as well, and to help them carve a career beyond their playing days. “The problem is regarding players who are still playing in their careers. They have agents. Sometimes, you can’t even speak to the player – you must get to the agent. I don’t know what happens to agents in difficult times,” said Jordaan. “So, we also have to look at the question of intermediaries and agents. We should have a comprehensive review of all those things. “Next week, I’m meeting with player union representatives to address these issues and how we can deal with them.” Jordaan, who spoke glowingly about Masinga’s career, added that this was a big problem, and not just in Mzansi, but mostly in the African continent. “There’s almost a cycle from poverty to wealth, and then back to poverty. Phil Masinga understood that to break that cycle, education was important. “Yes, we should deal with those who die and give them a dignified funeral, but also the challenge of working with those who are here. “To be a coach, you attend coaching courses and qualify. It’s frustrating every time you read an article about a player who is struggling,” Jordaan added. He further mentioned that there’s a list of players who were supported by the 2010 World Cup Legacy Fund in terms of bursaries and that others already have qualified with degrees. “And also with Banyana, we saw Thembi Kgatlana there at the HPC at Tuks and look at them now, they’re graduates. “Speak to Banyana players, they’re confident, smart, graduates and some of them even run their own businesses.”
