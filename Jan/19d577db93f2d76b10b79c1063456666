Former model and Joburg socialite, Babalwa Mneno says she has been robbed of her personal, luxury possessions. The Barbs, as she is known, told fans on social media that thugs broke in to her house and made away with possession whose value is yet to be revealed. According to Barbs, the thugs took sunglasses, perfumes, purses and shoes in addition to some things that she is not yet aware of. “[I] don’t have the courage to check what’s all been stolen [because] I will just have a heart attack... It will dawn to me when I’m looking for that particular thing I guess,” she said. But, never one to be deterred, Barbie (her other aka) went on to brag about more of her expensive luxury possessions in the very same post. “On a lighter note, my Gucci [birthday] gift glasses escaped the thieves hands hahahaha,” she said. Well, clearly she hasn’t learned from Kim Kardashians and Safari Samuels (to name a few) that social media bragging invites thieves.
