HENDRICK Chamanga (31) has wowed Mzansi with one of his creations. Hendrick from Dilopye Village near Hammanskraal, Tshwane, has built his dream sports car. Daily Sun published a story about Hendrick in June. Displaying his beautiful creation, people could not believe he used scrap metal to build the car. He has already built a replica police helicopter, a cop van, as well as a statue of a police officer standing next to the bakkie. “My car is going to be the first African car made by hand in Africa by an African.” It took him five months to build.
