NOW that Selby Shezi has died, Phuzekhemisi Mnyandu could be in a much stickier situation this year. Legendary maskandi star Phuzekhemisi allegedly shot band member Selby last year. Selby (35) died in hospital on 27 December after apparently being shot by the Imbizo hitmaker after an argument earlier last month. Phuzekhemisi, whose real name is Zibokwakhe Mnyandu (55), was bust for attempted murder on 10 December while Selby was still fighting for his life in hospital. He was granted R3 000 bail in the Durban Magistrates Court on 11 December. But now that Selby is dead, the case could be changed to murder. Selby’s brother Sbusiso Shezi (27) said the family were devastated by his death. “All we know is they got along very well,” he said. “We don’t know what happened on the day he was shot.” He said they had never spoken to Phuzekhemisi. “He never visited us. “I think it is because the matter is in court or he is ashamed. We hope to get the truth in court,” he said. “If justice is done, we will get closure. What happened hurt us a lot.” Phuzekhemisi is set to return to court on 15 February. According to the statement read in court, Phuzekhemisi, Selby and another companion were in a car in Amanzimtoti when they had an argument. The argument started after Selby got out of the car but banged the door. Phuzekhemisi allegedly pulled out a gun and shot Selby in the stomach and chest, but Selby tried to grab the gun and Phuzekhemisi was hit on the forehead. Phuzekhemisi told Daily Sun he was not allowed to comment since the matter was in court.
