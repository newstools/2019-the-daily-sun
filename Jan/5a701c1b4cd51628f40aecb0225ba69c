 The Ekurhuleni municipality has received a clean audit for the 2017/2018 financial year and Mayor Mzwandile Masina has welcomed the Auditor-General's (AG) report. The City of Ekurhuleni's audit committee tabled the report at its first ordinary council meeting on Thursday. "The AG found an improvement in the overall outcome of performance reporting. The City received a clean audit on performance information and no audit findings were reported," the mayor's spokesperson, Phakamile Mbengashe, said. Mbengashe added that improvements were noted in the report. "The City did not incur fruitless and wasteful and unauthorised expenditure in the 2017-18 financial year... and [there was] a decrease of R198m (42%) in irregular expenditure from R472.6m to R274.5m."  "We have continued to display our commitment to good governance and accountability following the AG's 2016/2017 financial year audit," said Masina.
