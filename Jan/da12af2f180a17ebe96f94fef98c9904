A MAN who is living with a disability is begging his councillor to help him get an RDP. “I live by myself and sleep with one eye open,” said Siphiweyinkosi Ngidi from KwaMancinza, north of Durban. He lives in a two-roomed shack that is slowly falling apart and fears one day it will collapse while he’s asleep. Siphiweyinkosi (58) said his wife died in 2007 and he lives alone. “I built the shack a long time ago, and I don’t think it will last much longer because it’s old,” he said. “My bedroom wall collapsed last week. Fortunately I didn’t get injured.” He said he now sleeps on the sofa, which makes for a very uncomfortable bed. “It’s not easy to live like this. When I need the toilet I’m forced to go outside.” He said he pays people to clean the shack and help him fetch water. “I rely on my disability grant. “After I’ve paid the people who help me, I’m left with very little money to buy food,” he said. Councillor Simon Khuboni said Siphiweyinkosi has told him about his problem. “I’m going to contact the housing department so that he can get an RDP,” said Khuboni.
