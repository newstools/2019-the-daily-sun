GOGO Maureen Molale always struggled to wake up in the morning to start work. However, since her little dog Spikey has joined the family from Protea North in Soweto, the 60-year-old has been getting up on time. This is because her chow dog Spikey has become Maureen’s alarm. Spikey comes to her bed and barks every morning at 4am so she can start preparing the fat cakes she sells. “If I don’t wake up, he gets on the bed and drags off the blankets. Before Spikey came, I would sometimes not hear the alarm on my phone go off and I would go back to sleep.” Maureen said Spikey was a very clever dog and she was grateful to the friend who gave her the dog two years ago. She said she used to work for the police but when she retired, she decided to start a small business to keep busy. “When I retired, a friend gave me Spikey as a gift. We became friends from the word go. Spikey was still a puppy. “He got used to waking up at 4am and he’s better than the phone,” she said. Maureen said at first, she was shocked that a dog could wake her but as time went by, she realised Spikey was not an ordinary dog. “He is different, and very intelligent. If there is something wrong in the yard, he finds it first.”
