THE quality education at Olifantsfontein Primary School might be affected by the large number of pupils given places. This was after fuming parents threatened to shut down the school in Ekurhuleni if their children were not accepted. They demanded to be addressed by the department of education, saying the school had placed them on a waiting list for too long. The pupils most affected are Grade R pupils going to Grade 1, as parents had to register online despite their children having done Grade R at the school. Yesterday, parents were met by the school leadership and representatives of the Ekurhuleni North district education office. It was then agreed that 333 qualifying, but unplaced, pupils would be absorbed, although classrooms would be full. District acting director Nonceba Ntuta said lack of schools in the area and late registration contributed to the problem. Olifantsfontein Primary has been in existence for 107 years and is the only school in the area, resulting in a great demand. Ntuta said they have used specials rooms and divided the staff room to make more classrooms. She said: “The school will be operating in an abnormal situation. I’m hoping laterparents will not come back to complain.”
