Oh boy is it good to be L’Vovo Derango right now. The legendary Kwaito musician whose real name is Thokozani Ndlovu seems to be living his very best life. From buying brand new German cars, to having life-long dreams come true, and even working with people who inspired his career. PICS: LVOVO'S FLASHY NEW RIDE To top it all off, he has now made another life-long dream a reality when he gave his childhood home a facelift. The 38-year-old shared before, during and after images of his childhood home in Newcastle, KZN. The musician spent his entire working life building up to this moment and he couldn’t be happier with himself. READ AGAIN: L’VOVO’S TV DREAM REALISED “When prayer becomes your habit miracle become your lifestyle. Never give up no matter what comes you way,” he said. A few days ago, the musician also showed off his brand new BMW X5 on social media and thanked God for his blessings. Someone is clearly raking in the big bucks! ICYMI: LVOVO'S EMOTIONAL TRIBUTE TO ZAKES BANTWINI Two few weeks ago, it was revealed that L’Vovo would star in the Mzansi Magic drama series, eHostela, as Nhlamvukayigeji, making his TV dream an instant reality. Derango has been so happy of late (understandably so), he is even dishing out thanks you cards all over the place. “Thank u for believing in me and guiding me to be [the] person I am today; you saw something that no one saw even myself. You told me how I should protect this brand called Lvovo. I hope [you’re] proud and I’m still going strong thank you so much for everything we I LOVE YOU,” L’vovo said to Zakes Bantwini on Twitter.
