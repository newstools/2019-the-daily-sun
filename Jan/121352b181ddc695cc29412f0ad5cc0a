Bring it on! Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has been calling on Mzansi people to boycott Vodacom if it fails to pay Nkosana Makate by 1 February 2019 for his #PleaseCallMe idea. He is calling on people to show their support to Makate by cancelling their contracts with Vodacom and to stop from attending Vodacom sponsored events. Now Vodacom wants Lesufi to stop “making threats to invade and occupy” Vodacom stores. In a letter sent to Lesufi by their lawyers, Vodacom tells the MEC to ”stop making false and defamatory comments of and concerning our client in relation to its litigation with Mr Makate in general and in particular that our client is in wilful breach of the Constitutional Court that is acting in an unfair and morally repugnant manner towards Mr Makate”. They want Lesufi to “desist from calling for and /or inciting the invasion and occupation of the Vodaworld store or any other of our client’s premises including but not limited to its various stores around the country on 31 January 2019 or any other future dates”. They gave Lesufi until midday on January 30. Lesufi hit back at Vodacom. “Bring it on Vodacom! I am NOT easily intimidated. You can’t bully me or silence my support to the weak and vulnerable. This is a democratic country and I have the right to express my views without fear. The apartheid regime detained me without trial. I am not scared.”
