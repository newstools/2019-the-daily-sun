THE Democratic Alliance billboard that read #ANCISKILLINGUS was vandalised on Thursday, allegedly by family members of those who died through Life Esidimeni saga. Soon after the billboard was vandalised, City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba posted on Twitter and said: “Is there anything that the ANC does not want society to know? @Our_DA.” In the video, two men can be seen cutting and tearing the billboard which had the names of the people that died in the Esidimeni tragedy. Over 140 mentally-ill patients died mostly from dehydration and hunger after the Gauteng Health Department terminated its contract with the Life Esidimeni Group. Patients were then moved to ill-equipped NGOs, some with open bakkies and without identification as well as medical records. Furthermore, over 40 patients are still unaccounted by the department. The former Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, the former Head of Department, Dr Barney Selebano and the former head of mental unit, Dr Makgabo Manamela were among those implicated to have headed this deadly marathon project despite warnings from clinicians and organisations. Mahlangu resigned the day before the Health Ombudsman's report was released in February last year. Selebano and Manamela also tendered their resignations early this year. Mahlangu testified that she was never told that the project was harmful. She blamed her team for misleading her, adding that it was a collective decision to terminate the contract. Selebano on the other hand apologised to the families and claimed to have feared Mahlangu. While Manamela insisted she was instructed by Mahlangu to carry unlawful duties.
