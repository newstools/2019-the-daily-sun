SO MANY Mzansi people cry bitter tears in January after the crazy amount of money they spent in December. Mellony Ramalho, African Bank’s group executive for sales said: “If you’re smart with your planning, you could make that salary work extra hard for you.” Budget A budget helps you organise and plan your money, divide your income into expenses, savings and debt repayment. Budgets also make sure that you always know how much money you have and can use. Pay off your debt Pay off your debt. Start with the one with the highest interest rate such as credit cards. Start saving If an emergency comes up, it’s helpful to have an emergency fund saved up rather than use credit to deal with whatever the problem might be. The earlier you start saving the better, as the more money you will have when needed. If you invest your savings in a smart investment product, you earn interest. The longer you save, the more interest you will earn on earlier interest. Protect against disability and critical illness You may be fit and healthy now but an accident could strike at any time and that’s when you need your cover to work. Statistics show that one in four workers will become disabled or be diagnosed with a critical illness at some point in their careers. An income protection benefit pays you a monthly income during the period you are not able to earn an income due to injury or illness. Also don’t forget about retirement, although the last salary of your career is the furthest thought from your mind when you’ve just started earning your first salary. Medical aid can be as basic as a hospital plan and you can choose a life insurance option that requires a minimal initial investment. Speak to your financial advisor to find the right fit for your income and your needs. “It is important to remember is that many of the financial decisions you make today could have a major impact on your long-term financial future so never rush into a decision.”
