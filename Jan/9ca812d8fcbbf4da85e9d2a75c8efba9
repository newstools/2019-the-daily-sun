FOUR pupils have responded to their communityâ€™s cries for help. At least once a week, they push their wheelbarrows and carry their spades to close deep potholes around Sebokeng in the Vaal. This comes after service delivery protests and alleged irregular spending amounting to more than R800 million by the Emfuleni Municipality. Sipho Moyake (19) and Siyabonga Maseko (19) told Daily Sun they had been filling potholes for more than four months and some motorists tipped them. They said it took about a week before they needed to work on a hole again. They allege rubbish has not been collected for almost a year. Municipal spokesman Stanley Gava said residents had created the problems by throwing foreign objects down the drain. He said a progress report would be announced today.  They had borrowed 10 trucks, which would start collecting rubbish today.
