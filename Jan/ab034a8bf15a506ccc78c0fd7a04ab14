PRESENTERS at community radio station Motheo FM have shut it down. Fifteen presenters said management failed to pay the stipends and bonuses they were promised. Presenter Vuyokazi Dunywa told Daily Sun they always struggle to receive their stipends and the station does not have Wi-Fi or landlines. “We are forced to use our cellphones to play music. We have stalkers but management tells us not to worry.” “We are using one toilet with the men. “We struggle to get home at night because the station says there is no petrol.” She said management earns a lot of money but presenters get peanuts. “When you raise a point, you are told you can be fired without notice. We want this management to step down.” Station manager Manko Buffel said: “There is not enough money for bonuses.” She said they don’t have Wi-Fi because a lot of money is paid to presenters. “We pay the presenters more and explain some of the money is for transport. I want to meet them to discuss the way forward.”
