Former Black Leopards and Chippa United coach Joel Masutha has found himself a new home. Masutha who was sacked by Chippa last Wednesday has joined National First Division Strugglers Maccabi FC on a six months deal. Last season Masutha promoted Leopards from NFD to Absa Premiership but was sacked early in the season following a string of poor results at Leopards. He will take over from Mokete Tsotetsi who helped the team gain promotion from the ABC Motsepe League last season. Tsotetsi won’t be fired but he has been demoted to be Masutha’s assistant. Maccabi are currently 10th on the NFD log with 21 points which they accumulated from 17 games. Masutha is not new in the NFD as he has coached the likes of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, Black Leopards and Royal Eagles.
