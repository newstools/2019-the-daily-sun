WHILE most South Africans, who have day jobs returned to work this week and some students, are trying to gain admission into different universities and schools around the country, rapper Khuli Chana is not about that life. The Never Grow Up hit maker is currently enjoying some downtime in Zanzibar. His hectic schedule might not have allowed him to go on vacation in December, but the star grabbed the chance to let his hair down this January â€“ the month most ordinary folks struggle with bear necessities. The star posted a series of pictures of himself on sabbatical. He is definitely living his best life and making the most of his holiday before the grind begins again. 2019 journey starts here in TANZANIA.I landed in Zanzibar this afternoon buzzing with mad ideas,I'm on a search for new possibilities.I can't wait to check out the Dar es salaam music scene...Yo @osborne_macharia Holla at your boy???? ?? by @lamiez_holworthy A post shared by  KHULI CHANA MOTSWAKORIGINATOR (@khulichana01) on Jan 3, 2019 at 12:15pm PST  Now that's how U smile in 2019,all we need now is a smash hit to go with it.....@cloudsfmtz I got something special for u.
