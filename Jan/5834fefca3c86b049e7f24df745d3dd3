THE New Church of South Africa held a pupils’ prayer meeting at Isivivana Centre Hall in Khayelitsha on Sunday afternoon. Event organiser Noxolo Sekhobo saidkids don’t get the motivation they need. “Some of them didn’t do well last term, so we’re here to pray and motivate them to do better this year.” Life coach and former gangster Xolani Tshandu advised the pupils to avoid bad company. “Regardless of your cirmumstances, the biggest weapon you have is your mind. If you change your mind, you change your future. “If you want to change your circumstances, you need to change your environment. By that I mean if you eat your lunch at school, you have a choice who you want to eat it with. “It’s proven that if you’ve spent 21 days with people, you adopt their character and habits – and they become you or you become them. Choose friends wisely.” Pupils from Khayelitsha and others from Beaufort West told the SunTeam they’d never been to such a session. Said Thobeka Vries (16), a pupil from Khayelitsha: “The session was encouraging. The life coach taught me something I didnt know about changing my mind into thinking positively.” The speakers came dressed in their graduation gowns to inspire pupils. Chartered Accountant Nomzamo Bobotyana, who matriculated at Fezeka High School in 2001, said: “Never think it will be easy. You will fail along the way, but don’t lose hope.” “What’s imporant is to keep your eyes on the ultimate prize – passing.”
