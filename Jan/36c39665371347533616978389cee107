The legendary Yvonne Chaka Chaka paid the late Brenda
Fassie’s family a visit. She is starting the years with the spirit of Ubuntu and
making people happy, she shared a video on twitter of when she arrived at the
late Brenda’s home finding her siblings who were so excited to see her they
even shed tears. She shared a video on Twitter where she was singing
Vulindlela with one of the late singer’s sisters who only recognized who it was
as they were singing. The Umqobothi hitmaker told the SunTeam that she was in Cape
Town and thought she should go see how they are doing. “The last time I went to see them was a couple of years ago,
and when we arrived, they didn't recognize us hence the reaction when they
finally saw who it was. I also went to see how they are doing after their young
brother Kenny passed away. I was Overseas when I heard the news and couldn’t
attend the funeral,” she said. Yvonne said she this is a way of showing the spirit of
Ubuntu because it takes a small gesture to make someone smile. “It was lovely seeing everyone, I actually didn’t put the
whole video, but it was a beautiful feeling I am happy.  And to also bring something small just to
share with them as a family I can’t explain the feeling. This is really a good
start because it is a reminder that we need to be kind.” 1st Jan 2019. I decided to visit Brenda Fassie s home found her two sisters it was a great reunion . I am glad I went on this day.
