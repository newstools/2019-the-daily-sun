WHEN Masabata Moduka (37) first started her garden, people laughed at her because she didn’t have running water at home. But Masabata from Dipotomaneng kasi in Clocolan, Free State didn’t let this worry her. Now she has a small garden to feed her three children and also makes a profit. She grows cabbage, beetroot and onions. “I started with flowers after gaining skills of how to grow vegetables. “Three years ago, I wouldn’t have dreamt of having my own garden because of the water crisis in our community.” She said she collected water every morning from a nearby dam with buckets. “Neighbours said my garden was going to die. After the first year, I lost all my vegetables but never gave up as this was all I knew. “I have invested a lot of time and effort in the garden and now it is finally paying off. My vegetables are beautiful and local stall owners buy from me. I can support my family with the money I make.” She said she plans to make her garden bigger and hopes to pass her skills on to her children so they can become farmers too and make a living. Masabata said: “My dream is to one day become a supplier for big businesses and to employ people who are interested in learning about gardening.”
