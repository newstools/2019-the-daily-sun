Kaizer Chiefs head coach, Ernst Middendorp has hinted that goalkeeper Virgil Vries may not start in goal in their next match against Orlando Pirates. Vries committed another costly mistake when he failed to deal with a cross into the box in the final minutes on Wednesday night which saw Amakhosi suffering a 1-0 defeat to Cape Town City at FNB Stadium. Chiefs next match will be against their Soweto rivals, Pirates on 9 February at the same venue.Middendorp couldn’t hide his disappointment at the manner of defeat in a post-match interview saying it was unacceptable to concede such a soft goal. “Of course, I’m not happy with this, this is the second time, what must we say? It happened against Sundowns where it was unbelievable to lose that game and now again it happened and again it's unbelievable to lose here," said Middendorp after the match. “We have to work it out in the next 10 days and see who is in the goalposts next Saturday. Conceding a goal like this is not acceptable. We have this goalkeeping issue, but on the other side of the pitch we failed to take our chances." The 29-year-old goalkeeper, who replaced injured Itumeleng Khune said he won’t allow the error to affect him and he took some lessons from the error. Vries stated: "We play as a team and these things happen but I need to reflect on my mistakes and in times like these I just need to keep on smiling and learn, work hard."
