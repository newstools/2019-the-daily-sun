BANJIWE Khosa is a sad gogo. The 76-year-old from Ludlow Trust outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said when her husband Josias died last year, he left her nine cows. But thugs killed three of her cattle at the weekend. The incident happened at Ludlow Trust after Mhala cops spotted a suspicious bakkie moving meat on Sunday. The cops chased the bakkie, but the suspects abandoned it in the bush and fled on foot. Gogo Banjiwe told Daily Sun: “I received a call about meat that was being transported in a bakkie and I knew my cows were dead. “This has caused more pain because I’m still mourning the death of my husband. “What’s even worse is that two of the cows were pregnant.” She said she hoped the culprits would be bust and punished for what they did. Mhala police spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane said the cops were investigating a case of stock theft but no arrests had been made.
