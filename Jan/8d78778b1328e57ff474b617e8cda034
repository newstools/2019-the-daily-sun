GATVOL residents protested in Motherwell NU 5, Port Elizabeth yesterday. They said they wanted the decision by the department of education to evict them from the disused DDT Jabavu Secondary School to be reversed. Wandisile Lukwe of Zwartkops Conservancy said: “The school was closed in 2014 and organisations, including ours, occupied the premises to stop vandalism. “We used a lot of money to renovate the buildings and toilets.” Julia Ndwayana, Lathi Thaa project manager, said: “We occupied the school in 2017 after I followed all processes. If we are evicted from here, where will we go?” Councillor Mazangwandile Dano said: “All alterations of government buildings are done by the department of public works. I don’t think the government will pay as it was not involved.” Andile Nogaga from the department said: “Motherwell does not have a school for children with special needs and disabilities. We want to accommodate them.”
