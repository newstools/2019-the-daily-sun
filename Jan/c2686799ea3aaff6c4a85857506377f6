SUPERSPORT United captain Dean Furman is disappointed with his side’s performance. This follows a 2-0 defeat to Black Leopards in an Absa Premiership match played at Thohoyandou Stadium on Saturday . Furman, who played his first game after being sidelined for two months due to a shoulder injury he sustained in October last year, says they didn’t put enough effort to win the game. “Leopards deserved to win,” said a frustrated Bafana Bafana star. “Leopards played very well and to be honest, we were not good enough. We have a lot of work to do. This is not the performance of Supersport United.” Despite the setback, the 30-year-old said he is delight to play again. United coach Kaitano Tembo shared the same sentiments as his captain about his side’s poor display. “Leopards were a better team today. They created many goal scoring chances and also dominated,” said Tembo. “It is true they deserve three points. I am really disappointed with the performance of my team today.” Tembo said the scorching heat in Venda which made his side struggle to play was not an excuse. “Heat or no heat, we have to put a good performance. We have to be honest, we did not put in good work today,” said Tembo. “We do not have to make excuses. We tried in the second half but we were below par. Leopards had the heart to win this game and we did not have that hunger. We beat them 4-0 in the first round and they wanted to reserve that defeat and get revenge, which they did.” The three times PSL champions have now suffered two consecutive league defeats. They came to this clash from a 1-0 defeat by Cape Town City. United are now eighth on the league table, with 23 points from 16 matches. Tembo’s lads are now 10 points behind leaders Bidvest Wits. United now face a huge mountain to climb if they still dream of challenging for the championship. They will meet Bloemfontein Celtic in their next league game at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm)
