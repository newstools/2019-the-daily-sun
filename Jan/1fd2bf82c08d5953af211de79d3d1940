Our favourite pantyless queen of the dancefloor, Zodwa Wabantu is more than just a dancer you know. It turns out, the Savanna-toting dancer has a beauty trick or two up her sleeve. And if you pay close attention, you might just learn a thing or two. The KZN-based performer has shared a rather unique beauty secret in a home-made video on the gram. This was a first in what Zodwa promises will be a series of videos in which she will share some of her most prized beauty secrets. “Ladies you've been asking why I don't have Kiwi between my Thighs. Well that's my Kasi Treatment, Remedy,” she said. What is “kiwi” you ask? And how does one get rid of it? Zodwa has all the answers. “Kiwi” is a Zulu term for the dark inner thigh spots that some women have, leaving them feeling self-conscious when they have to take their clothes off or wear short clothing. But no more, forget the long pants, forget the sarongs at the beach and forget the pricey creams, Zodwa has your back. According to Zodwa, a bottle of methylated spirit and a dry cloth is all you need. The vosho queen told fans that you need only rub the spirit in between your thighs using the cloth every single day until the dark spots are all gone. Who knew?
