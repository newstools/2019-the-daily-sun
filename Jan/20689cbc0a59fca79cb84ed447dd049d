DOZENS of workers from trade unions affiliated to Zwelinzima Vavi’s Saftu have taken to the streets to condemn police brutality directed at protesting members. Speaking to the SunTeam, Omar Parker, co-ordinator of the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers in the Western Cape, said cops favoured employers during protests. “Instead of doing their job, they jump in to protect the interests of the employers. They must protect the people of South Africa, not the rich few,” said Parker. Luvuyo Jantjies (41) said they had been protesting for the past three months for Dischem to increase their salaries to R12 500 from R5 000 per month. Gathered near the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, the protesters have been carrying placards with messages screaming against cops. “Don’t beat us for exercising our rights,” read one placard. “We are sick of police brutality,” another poster read. Union members painted the streets red as they went to hand over their memorandum at the Cape Town Central Police Station. “If cops continue to mistreat us we are going to intensify the protests. We are not going to bury our heads in the sand and allow brutality to continue,” said Parker. He said one woman was hit on the eye by a rubber bullet during one of their protest actions against Dischem. “All our strikes have always been protected yet cops always find ways to attack us,” said Parker.
