A MAN died after being hung by furious residents for
collecting and eating human poo – apparently for evil muthi purposes. According to Punch, Babatunde Ajonileju (29) was
allegedly gathering and eating some of the poo in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, on
Monday. An unnamed old woman spotted him and raised the alarm. A group of angry young men then caught him. Ajonileju, who was believed to be a sangoma, apparently
claimed some of the poo he’d been collecting was destined for the church. An eyewitness said: “Nothing could be confirmed. The leader
of the white garment church in Odo Ado is not in town. The man attempted to
escape, but the pursuing mob caught up with him at the Red Roof junction.” Cop Caleb Ikechukwu said: “It was alleged that Ajonileju
gathered human faeces for ritual purposes. What the people did was to lynch him
to death. “That was jungle justice. It is not acceptable anywhere.
What the people were supposed to do was to hand him over to the police for
proper investigation. It is only then we would be able to establish if what they
said he did was actually true. “We have yet to make any arrest.”
