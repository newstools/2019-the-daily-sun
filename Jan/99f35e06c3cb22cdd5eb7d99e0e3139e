SCHOOLS that were torched will not be a priority for renovation. This was revealed by KZN Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana after Mvuzo High School in uMgungundlovu and Bathembu High School in uMzinyathi were set alight on Saturday. Dlungwana said the department cannot renovate these schools at the expense of schools that had already been chosen for renovation. “This is our way of discouraging people from damaging schools. We cannot keep taking 10 steps backwards,” said Dlungwana. He said the fire in uMgungundlovu destroyed Mvuzo High School’s administration block. “Some textbooks were also affected but the stationery was spared because it was in the storeroom. Mvuzo is a state-of-the-art school that was opened in 2017. It has been broken into 16 times. “Just last month it was broken into three times,” said Dlungwana. He said textbooks and stationery have been taken to a nearby primary school which has never been broken into. “In Bathembu High School the administration block was burned down along with textbooks and stationery.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incidents: “A case of arson was opened at Alexandra Road Police Station and a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Msinga cop shop.” No arrests have been made.
