HE IS officially a dead man – but he is very much alive! Joseph Mokoena (57) from Dobsonville, Soweto told Daily Sun his fake death was allegedly arranged by his 36-year-old stepson, who is a cop. He said he raised him since he was nine years old. The stepson is accused of submitting fraudulent documents to an insurance company to claim life insurance money in November. Joseph’s wife, Zodwa, who is the biological mother, said she wanted her son to face the law. Joseph said he was shocked to receive a call from an insurance investigator on Thursday wanting to establish if he was indeed dead. “According to the investigator I was found dead under a bridge near Vereeniging in October and the amount claimed for my life was R100 000,” said Joseph. “The investigator showed me the fake death certificate,” said Joseph. Joseph said he went to Home Affairs on Monday and the system confirmed he was dead. When contacted for comment, stepson Simphiwe Mdikane said he didn’t want the paper to be involved and said we should never contact him again. Dobsonville police spokesman Constable Mzwakhe Xazi said a case of fraud was opened and transferred to Vereeniging. In an email sent to Daily Sun, 1Life said it knew of the attempted claim. “We rejected the claim and the matter was referred to the police,” said the insurer.
