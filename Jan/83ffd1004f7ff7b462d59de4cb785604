A TAXI driver was found murdered on Thursday with his private parts cut off. Zandile Tulman (25) from Walmer kasi in Port Elizabeth was attacked at midnight by a group of people and later killed. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “Zandile was severely beaten and shot three times. “He died at the scene. “The gang of ruthless killers allegedly forced open the door to the shack in area Q, where he and his girlfriend, Anele Matshaba (28) were sleeping. “Earlier, four men entered the shack of another man and dragged him out. He sustained severe head injures and a gunshot wound. “He died at the scene. “Half an hour later, the same gang stormed into Zandile’s shack.” Naidu said police later arrested four suspects in Airport Valley in connection with the two murders. “Three guns and suspected stolen property were recovered during the arrest. “The four suspects, aged 24 to 30, were charged with murder,” she said. “A fifth suspect, at whose house the firearms were found, was held on charges of prohibited possession of firearms, illegal possession of ammunition and of suspected stolen property.” Naidu said when police examined Tulman’s body, they found his private parts had been cut off with an unknown object. The suspects will appear in Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court today.
