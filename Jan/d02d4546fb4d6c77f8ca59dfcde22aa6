THESE brothers have big plans and they won’t allow poverty to stand in their way. Dumisani (30), Nelson (25), Khulekani (21) and Sandiso Mokoena (18) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, have built a car from scratch to show what they can do. Dumisani told Daily Sun: “We want to sell cars like this. “This car can help a person who wants to travel around the kasi or buy groceries.” He said after he finished school, there was no money for him to continue his studies so he stayed at home. “Two of my brothers have completed matric and are at home. The third brother is in matric this year and will be staying home next year. We decided to put a stop to this.” “I pitched the idea of building a car to them early last year and they liked it. It took us a year to build it with corrugated iron and the engine of a four-wheeled motorbike.” Dumisani did most of the welding while Nelson focused on the interior. Khulekani did the design and drawing and Sandiso did measurements to make sure the car was balanced. “Working like this showed us that together we can achieve anything,” said Nelson. The brothers said they wanted to sell the car and use the profit to send Nelson to school. They would then work towards getting money for the rest of them to study. When the SunTeam visited the brothers, they all got into the car to show it could take a lot of weight. “We would have built an even nicer car if we had the funds but we had to hustle for everything. We took some of our grocery money for the project,” said Nelson. He said he wanted to study engineering so he could uplift his family. Their mum Christina (49) said she was very proud of her boys.
