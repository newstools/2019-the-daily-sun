Fitness guru Sbahle Mpisnae has decided to give back to those less fortunate than her. The star, who is lucky to be alive after her near tragic accident that left her in ICU for months  last month, is doing her bit to make other people's lives better. Sbahle is recovering well after the crash and she has plenty to be grateful for as she has even returned to one of her favourite places, the gym. She took to social media to share some of the snaps showing her donating 200 school shoes and 1,200 sanitary pads at Mkhumbane Primary School in Durban alongside her brother.
