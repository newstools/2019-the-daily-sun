There’ll be no more Mr Nice Guy from Dr Malinga in 2019! The king of kicks himself says he’s done “having a good heart”. And this isn’t just in his personal life, but also in his business affairs. Malinga was chatting to TshisaLive about his 2019 resolutions and what he plans to do differently this year. He did, however, tell the publication that he hasn’t particularly set any resolutions for this year because his 2018 resolutions left him with a big shock. But one thing he will be doing differently in 2019 is cutting the nice guy act in business. “I want to change my attitude towards hard work because I was lazy in 2018. I want to stop having a good heart. I want to start firing people who don’t do things that I hired them for. I want to stop mixing business with pleasure. I want the best team for 2019,” he told TshisaLive. Despite his new approach at life, Malinga did have a great 2018 with his work soaring to new heights and is family being blessed a little baby boy. And with his new outlook on life and new business acumen, brand Malinga seems to be headed in the right direction.
