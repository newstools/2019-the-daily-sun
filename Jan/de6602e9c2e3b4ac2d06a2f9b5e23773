THE terrified child ran into the street and stopped a taxi. He had just witnessed his father attacking his mother after a terrible argument. The six-year-old from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni jumped into the taxi and went to his relatives to tell them what was happening in the house. The relatives alerted the public and the cops. Ekurhuleni central cluster spokeswoman Captain Pearl van Staad said the man struck the wife with a sharp object. “A 49-year-old man then hanged himself in front of their bedroom door. The wife’s neck was slit with a sharp object and she was found in a pool of blood on the bed,” said Van Staad. “We understand the couple was going through a divorce and the motive is believed to be related to domestic violence.” Cases of murder and suicide were opened at Daveyton Police Station. “Parents should not fight or attack each other in front of their children. This leaves them scarred for life,” said Van Staad. She said a local pastor was arranged to give the boy counselling. The boy is currently with his relatives.
