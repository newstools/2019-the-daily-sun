IDOLS SA star Mthokozisi Ndaba’s dream of working with Prince Kaybee has come true. It happened after he posted an RnB version of the artist’s hit song Banomoya on his Instagram page. Apparently, Prince Kaybee asked to work with him on remixing the song after seeing the post. Mthokozisi said: “It has always been my dream to work with him. God quickly answered my prayers,” He said he did a cover of the song and posted it along with the video clip on his Instagram page. “I got carried away and just rearranged and remixed the song without his permission. “ I then wrote: ‘Banomoya RnB cover coming soon. Shall I?’ My intention was to see how fans would react to it.” He was surprised when it caught Prince Kaybee’s attention.“A miracle happened. He saw it on Sunday and sent me a message to fly to Joburg. “He wanted us to record the RnB version and use it as an intro to his upcoming album,” Mthokozisi said . By Monday afternoon, the RnB track was done and dusted. The duo posted clips, with Prince Kaybee saying: “Shout out to Mthokozisi. Something huge is coming. I called this guy yesterday and he was here today.” Mthokozisi said: “Working with him was amazing. I thank Prince Kaybee for believing in me.”
