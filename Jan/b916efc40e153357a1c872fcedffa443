A SIX-month pregnant woman who was stabbed 14 times in her house on New Year’s Eve wants justice. Agreeneth Mthabini said she pressed charges against the man after she was discharged from hospital on 4 January but he is still roaming the streets. The 26-year-old mother of two from Dixie Village in the Greater Manyeleti area of Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said now she feared for her life. She said she heard footsteps on 31 December while was she and her kids were asleep. “I saw a man standing behind mye bed. He jumped at me, grabbing me by my neck and sat over my stomach while stabbing me in the back. I shouted his name and asked why he was killing me. My brother called neighbours for help. But unfortunately, he jumped out of the window and ran away,” said Agreeneth. “Few days later I received a call from police saying they were on the way to my home but they never came.” On Friday, angry villagers approached chief Theophilus Mnisi, a former magistrate, for help. “We want to find out what happened to this case. Cops and the Mhala Magistrates Court prosecutor are pointing fingers at each other,” said Mnisi. Resident Rex Ntimane said the man was being protected as he was related to a cop. “We will ensure Minister Bheki Cele deals with the matter. They are taking advantage of the victim, maybe because she is an orphan,” he said. Captain Sfiso Nyakane said if the community was not happy they were welcome to approach the station commander or branch commander.
