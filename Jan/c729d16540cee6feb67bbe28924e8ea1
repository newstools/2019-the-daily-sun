LIFE is hard for Tebogo Mputla. The 20-year-old from Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said his problems started when his family left him. He told Daily Sun he was shocked when he came back home from engomeni (mountain school) to find the family shack locked. Tebogo shared the shack with his grandparents Miriam and Simon Shabangu and his uncle, Thabo Mputla. He said the last time he saw his family was in 2017. “I regret going to engomeni because it brought suffering to my life.” He then moved to Mamelodi West, hoping to have a better life, but ended up sleeping on the streets. To add to his problems, he was bitten by a spider last month. “I’ve suffered a lot and I’m tired of selling bottles and plastic. The little money I make goes towards my drug addiction. Being an addict is painful. I want to quit,” he said. Thebe Mohatle, a spokesman for social development department, said that Tebogo should go to a hospital. “Tebogo needs to start at the hospital to be referred to our drug rehab centre for treatment. The second phase will be to help him trace his family,” he said.
