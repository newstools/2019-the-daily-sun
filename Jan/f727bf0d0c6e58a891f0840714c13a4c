 FORMER SABC COO and African Content Movement leader Hlaudi Motsoeneng has admitted that after he left the public broadcaster, Bosasa paid for his legal bills. At the State Capture Inquiry, former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi confirmed to the commission that the Bosasa paid the legal fees of Motsoeneng. Agrizzi said Motsoeneng received R1.1 million to pay his legal team, during the disciplinary hearing at the public broadcaster. He added that Bosasa did not receive anything in return for funding his legal bills. Speaking to Eusebius McKaiser on Radio 702, he said the country should vote for his party because of his credibility. Defending his tenure at the SABC and the debacle of the matric certificate, he said: “People of South Africa are not stupid, they are aware that I never lied, the SABC themselves have explained that in never lied about the matric certificate. I have never said I’ve got matric.” On the issue of grants, Motsoeneng said pensioners social grants should be double the amount. “I’ve never said we are going to get rid of grants, I said as a nation – we should not create a lazy nation,” Motsoeneng said. “I said we should create more employment, so that the dependency of many South Africans on the social grants system.” He added.
