A 51-YEAR-OLD police sergeant from Bochum cop shop in Limpopo is lucky to be alive. On Thursday morning at about 1am, the police van he was driving was swept away by floods in Ga-Machaba Village. Sergeant Solomon Mashalane climbed onto the roof of the bakkie and called for help. He was driving one of three police vans responding to a robbery at two village schools. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they received a call about an unknown number of suspects who arrived at Ralekwalane High School, tied up security officers on duty, broke the doors and stole three laptops. “The suspects then went to Machaba Primary School, where they took a laptop and two projectors.” The police vehicles arrived within minutes in spite of the rain. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba thanked the residents who swam to the stranded cop and rescued him. “The suspects in these business robberies are still at large and a manhunt is under way to trace them,” said Ledwaba.
