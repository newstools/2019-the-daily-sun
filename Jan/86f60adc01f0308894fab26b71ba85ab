THE PSL will shut down! That is the worst possible scenario, in the event Icasa implement the proposed regulations over sport TV broadcast rights in the country. The communications authority published draft regulations in the government gazette last month aimed at compelling the SABC to televise major sporting events, including football, rugby, cricket and athletics. Addressing a press conference following the PSL Board of Governors, PSL chairman Irvin Khoza painted a bleak picture of what could become of local football in the future. The proposed concept regulation would deal a devastating blow to the PSL’s biggest income stream... the multi-billion TV broadcast rights. “As we stand now are a bleak future it’s so painful. We will be out of business,” said Khoza. “The industry will collapse. We will go back to 1995. The PSL will shut down because we won’t be able to justify our existence. “If we cut the lifeblood of what runs this engine, we will have nothing else to do. Without the broadcast rights professional football would not have gone forward. It would have stagnated, gone back to 1995.” Khoza explained they have engaged Icasa before, made all submissions in terms of what is required of the PSL. Like the SA Rugby and Safa, the PSL generate their income through broadcast rights. Since they signed a sponsorship with pay channel Multichoice, the League has generated over R2 billion in revenue, which is mainly their source of income to fund the Premiership and the National First Division. Khoza added: “With the stroke of a pen, Icasa wants to take our rights to sell exclusively. This will cripple our revenue by 80 percent and clubs will have to strip their staff to the bone. “We will have a situation where clubs will not be able to pay their players. It will be the end of professional football as we know it today. “Without adequate funding professional football will fall.” No broadcast rights deal will mean:
