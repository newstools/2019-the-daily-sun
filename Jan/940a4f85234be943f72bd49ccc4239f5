THE deaths of two prisoners have left their families with many questions. They were awaiting trial at the Thohoyandou Juvenile Prison in Limpopo when they died in a fire last Thursday. It’s understood that Vhuthuhanga Kutame (19) from Dzwerani and Mashudu Maphulu (22) from Vyeboom were sharing a cell meant for one person with a third inmate, who was seriously injured, at the time of the incident. Vhuthuhanga’s brother Thifhelimbilu said he suspected the scene was tampered with to make it look like there had been a fire. “There are many things that make us believe he was killed,” he said. Correctional services spokeswoman Tshidi Mapole denied the allegations. She said the injured inmate confirmed there had been a fire. Limpopo police confirmed the incident and said two inquest dockets were opened.
