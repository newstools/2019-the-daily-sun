AUTHORITIES are worried that attacks on paramedics are on the rise. The City of Joburg’s Emergency Management Services staff continue to bear the brunt of senseless attacks, with the latest incidents in Alexandra and Soweto reported in the past two days. According to EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi, there was an attack on paramedics at a Lenasia filling station on Tuesday. He said the hijackers got away with the ambulance. “The paramedics were not harmed, although they were traumatised,” Mulaudzi said. The damaged vehicle was later recovered at Nancefield hostel. On Sunday, Alexandra firefighters who were monitoring New Year’s festivities were attacked by attempted hijackers, but no one was hurt. “We’re concerned about these constant attacks, which cause panic among our emergency officers,” said Mulaudzi. But EMS did not support a call by a union for staff to carry firearms. “If they are armed, they’ll become more vulnerable. It will create confusion. “Instead, we aim to work with community police officials to educate the public about the services being rendered by EMS officials who look after the safety of residents,” he said. Last week eNCA reported that a union representing paramedics encouraged its members to arm themselves. The South African Emergency Personnel Union claims to represent about 7 000 paramedics, but its call has been condemned. Raveen Naidoo, national director of emergency medical services and disaster management at the health department, asked the union to retract its call, but it has refused to do so.
