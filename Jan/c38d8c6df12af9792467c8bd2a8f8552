Former IT Girl turned pastor, Pushie Watson is getting ready to walk down the aisle once again and say the all-important “I Do”. The legendary former Jam Alley presenter told comedian Tumi Morake on her SABC 3 late night show, WTF Tumi that the time has come. "I am in preparation to be remarried, I'm excited, I feel like I've never been married,” she said. Pushie’s marriage to Sean Watson came tumbling down in 2017 with sources telling the Sunday Sun that they had experienced severe marital problems. But the now spiritually-saved Pushie is ready to do it all over again. “I look forward to it. I've learned a lot about marriage in the time that I've been single cause I've never been single until I divorced, and God has been really ministering to me about Godly marriage and intimacy in marriage, and giving me revelations about marriage and I'm so looking forward to it, I'm so excited,” she told Tumi. RUMOURS THAT WATSON COUPLE HAS PARTED That was that on the subject of marriage, but Pushie did also speak about her spiritual journey and her path to being a pastor. “For me, it was a really long process, but in between there was a lot of trouble. And when I finally surrendered, to the call of God in my life, it was like 2003. So, I'm very patient with everybody else because I know how patient God was with me,” she said.
