LAST Thursday and Saturday, Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng visited families affected by floods in Sebokeng, Vaal. The floods caused massive damage, eroding roads and destroying the retaining walls of over 70 houses in zone 6 and Residensia. Mboro prayed with the families and promised he would be back soon with more help. “I will help you,” he vowed. Yesterday, he made good on his promise. He told Daily Sun he was back in the area to help rebuild damaged homes. “We decided to come here as people lost their furniture and walls have fallen over,” the man of God said. “We’re donating building material and bringing in builders to help people start over.” Mboro donated bricks and sand. He said: “The builders will start as soon as the material is here. We’re also providing counselling.” He called on the South African Council of Churches to lend a helping hand. He also asked that stranded families who were hit by storms in the Vaal get support. Resident Paulina Gumbi (70) said: “We’re happy that this man of God has come forward to help us. “Some of us don’t even know him, but he cares enough to come and help strangers. “We hope that his mercy won’t end with us but extend to others.”
