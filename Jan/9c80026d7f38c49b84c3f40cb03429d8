TWO security guards will face a disciplinary hearing today following alleged bribery claims at a terminal at OR Tambo International Airport on Saturday. OR Tambo airport authorities said the women, aged 33 and 44, were suspended by their employer, Securitas, which is contracted to Emirates after a video surfaced on social media. In the video, one of the two guards appears to be taking money placed inside a passport while the women were checking passports. Securitas is one of nine security companies licensed by Airports Company SA to provide security in terms of contracts directly with several airlines. Bongiwe Pityi-Vokwana, general manager at OR Tambo, said the airline bears responsibility for the conduct of the service providers it contracts. “It is disturbing when those mandated to protect passengers and the integrity of a national key point betray the trust placed in them,” said Pityi-Vokwana. She said they will review the licensing conditions of the security company. According to management, there have been 676 arrests for all classes of crime representing a 20% reduction in cases reported at the airport over the past 12 months. Law enforcement agencies working at the airport have also made 1 186 seizures of drugs with a street value of R2,9 billion. Pityi-Vokwana said criminals go for vulnerable points in the airport environment and this requires constant coordination and collaboration.
