TWO suspects bust on charges of fraud and corruption at Wits University appeared in court yesterday. Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said one suspect was granted bail by the Joburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. A 19-year-old student was granted R10 000 bail while the second suspect, a 31-year-old administration officer, was denied bail. He was previously nabbed for driving under the influence of alcohol. The suspects were bust on Tuesday in a sting operation set up by the Hawks. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said: “The pair allegedly demanded large amounts from applicants who did not meet the admission criteria by manipulating the system and awarding them points for entrance.” University spokeswoman Buhle Zuma confirmed a staff member was arrested. “The university is working with the relevant authorities who are investigating the matter and cannot comment further at this stage.” Student registrations at the university continue.
