NEW traffic officer graduates are ready to serve communities. On Friday Gauteng Safety and Security MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane welcomed 90 new police officers into the province’s service during an event at Boekenhoutkloof Traffic College in Tshwane West. She said the graduates were recruited to beef up road safety in the province. “They were recruited through a vigorous selection process and successfully completed the training programme,” said Nkosi-Malobane. She said the recruitment was part of the Tshepo 1 Million project, a provincial youth empowerment initiative. “Young people are the pillars of our country. If they are not nurtured, guided and empowered, the future of this country will be doomed.” Nkosi-Malobane said the nation was concerned about the levels of lawlessness that led to road accidents. “The department will continue to conduct operations in 132 hazardous locations. Road users are expected to be vigilant, patient and to adhere to the rules of the road.”
