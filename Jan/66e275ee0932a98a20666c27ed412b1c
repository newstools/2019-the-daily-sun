GOGO Mgapheli Manqele has just had her first birthday party– at the age of 115! Councillor Mlungisi Shelembe threw a surprise party on New Year’s Day for gogo Mgapheli from Macambini Village in Gingindlovu, KZN who turned 115 that day. “I’ve never had a birthday party in my life, not even a birthday cake,” said Mgapheli with tears in her eyes. “This is the first time I got something like this and I’m over the moon. Even if I die today I will die happy.” She told her guests they must have vegetable gardens to eat organic food, which she said has kept her alive. “I grew up in a poor family. We were forced to have gardens so we could have something to eat. At first, I thought it was bad to eat vegetables but then saw people haf problems like high blood pressure because of the food they ate.” Gogo said she prays a lot because without God’s grace she would not be celebrating her birthday. “We often take the power of prayer for granted. God listens to us all the time. I encourage people to pray all the time.” Mgapheli has 15 children and 45 grandchildren. Shelembe said he saw gogo would be turning 115 on Tuesday while registering her as a beneficiary for a new toilet. “Having a person of her age in my ward is a blessing to the whole village, as they can learn a thing or two from her. “We wish her many more years to come,” Shelembe said.
