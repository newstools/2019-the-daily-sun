SIMANYENE High School has hit the ground running when it comes to preparing matrics for their final year. A motivational talk was held at the school in Asanda Village, Strand, near Cape Town on Tuesday. The teachers told the new matric class what was expected of them. Kholeka Nyhila reminded pupils that the matric year was very short. “This grade is very different from other grades. We should not be chasing work that wasn’t submitted on time because time is something we don’t have this year. The sooner you do your work, the more time you have for revision,” she said. Simanyene had a pass rate of 69,9% last year, which was up from 64,2% the previous year. This year, the school is aiming for a 70% pass rate. Fenny Khambule urged pupils to avoid alcohol and drugs, saying: “Just for 12 months. Sacrifice this time and give it your all. The nightlife is nice, but it won’t bring you good matric results, while sacrificing and studying will.” Pupil Liviwe Nkonyane (17) said she felt motivated by the teachers. “This shows our teachers really care about us. We want to make them proud and improve our results,” she said. “I think we can be a first rate class and bring a 100% matric pass rate.” Principal Monwabisi Matshoba said the talk was just the start of their plans for the year. “We will set quarterly targets because we want pupils this year to have a higher pass rate than previous classes.”
