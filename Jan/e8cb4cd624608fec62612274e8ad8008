For the
first time in South African History, sign language was included as a subject
during the 2018 National Senior Certificate exams. In what
Cindy Rutter, principal at the Dominican School for the Deaf in Wynberg,
Western Cape, calls a major victory, sign language has been recognized by the
Department of Basic Education as a home language. GroundUp
reports that four learners from the Dominican School wrote the 2018 sign
language exam. In the
exam, the learners were placed in closed-off booths. There they
watched questions in sign language before taking videos of themselves providing
answers. However, a
long road still lies ahead. Rutter said
that the challenge sign language is facing in total inclusion in the school curriculum
was access to resource. She
asserted that since sign language was written as a home language for the first
time, there were no textbooks or students who did sign language as a home
language in the past. She, however,
hailed this as a great victory. “It gives
confidence to deaf people because their language is recognized,” she is quoted
as saying. She also
said that recognizing sign language as a home language for matric put a
minority group on the map.
