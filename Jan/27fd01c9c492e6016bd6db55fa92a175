THE Shabangus are finding it hard to deal with the loss of their loved one. Petros (73) from Matsulu, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, was among seven people who died when the taxi they were travelling in crashed into a truck last Saturday morning. Shabangu, a car guard, was going to work on the day of the accident. His daughter Phetsile (24) told Daily Sun: “It’s hard for everyone in the family to accept what has happened. We don’t blame anyone and believe it was God’s will. “Our dad was everything to us, and he made sure we got what we wanted with the little he earned.” She said she’d miss his sense of humour and patience. “He was a loving, caring father. He dedicated most of his time to his job to make sure we didn’t go to sleep on an empty stomach. “This is a difficult time for us, but we believe God will help us heal.” Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane visited the families on Tuesday. He said: “We’re urging each and everyone to be more cautious because a lot of lives are involved.” Memorial and funeral services will be held soon. Investigations were still under way.
