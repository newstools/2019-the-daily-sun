A MAN suspected of murdering Sergeant Thembisile Ndlovu (42) and her husband Jabulani Khoza (40) will appear in court soon. The 31-year-old faces charges of murder, armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm in the Calcutta Magistrates Court, Mpumalanga. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the Mpumalanga serious organised crime unit and the tactical response team found the suspect in Mhluzi in the early hours of Saturday morning. Ndlovu and Khoza were killed on 1 December at their home in Bushbuckridge. “Ndlovu fought back and fatally wounded one suspect but two other suspects continued firing their guns and sadly, both Ndlovu and Khoza were killed,” said Mulaudzi. “The suspects fled the scene with the family’s vehicle, which was later found abandoned in the Bushbuckridge area.” He said the Hawks immediately took over the investigation, leading to the arrest of the suspect and the recovery of a firearm. The search for the third suspect is ongoing. National head of the Hawks Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya commended the investigating team for arresting the suspect and said he was confident the third suspect would be bust soon.
