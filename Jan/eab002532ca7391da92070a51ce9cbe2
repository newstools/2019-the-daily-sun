MATHAITHAI FC lived up to their name as they wreaked havoc to claim honours in the KwaMahlobo Games. Egged on by a capacity crowd which included Gauteng Sports MEC Faith Mazibuko and Banyana Banyana star Themi Kgatlana in Meadowlands, Soweto, Mathaithai edged favourites Snake Park Chillers 1-0 in a nail-biting final at the weekend. In heavy downpour, the Diepkloof side caused real “mathaithai” for the 40 teams, which participated in the competition and walked away with gold medals, a trophy and a staggering R120 000. Runners-up Chillers received R50 000 semifinalists Shake It Everyday and LNB Tax FC pocketed R15 000 each. “The KwaMahlobo Games have shown that there is an abundance of talent all over South Africa and this is confirmed by the big number of top coaches that came to watch the Games that included  U20 national team’s Thabani Senong,” said LaLiga African director Antonio Barradas. “We want to make this tournament even bigger next year. That is part of LaLiga’s agenda to grow the game in the country.” A total of 230 goals were scored in the 95 matches. Chillers hitman Zakhele Lepasa scooped the top goalscorer award with 10 goals while Mathaithai goalie bagged two awards, for the Best Goalkeper and the Player of the Tournament.
