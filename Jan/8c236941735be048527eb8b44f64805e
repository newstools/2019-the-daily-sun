 South Africa started off the New Year by officially assuming its seat as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for the period 2019-2020. South Africa's tenure in the Security Council will be dedicated to the legacy of former president Nelson Mandela, whose values and commitment to peace were commemorated last year during the centenary of his birth, reads a statement from the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. South Africa's term will also be an opportunity for the country to work towards the African Union's goal of "Silencing the Guns" on the Continent by 2020. Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu said on Tuesday: "The world is facing huge challenges, including rising unilateralism and widening geo-political divisions. These challenges threaten our collective resolve to address global challenges of peace, security and development. "South Africa will thus utilise its tenure on the Security Council to promote the maintenance of international peace and security through advocating for the peaceful settlement of disputes and inclusive dialogue," Sisulu said.  She said South Africa will encourage closer cooperation between the UN Security Council and other regional and sub-regional organisations, particularly the African Union.       https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sa-takes-up-seat-on-un-security-council-20190102
