THE family of a bodyguard to the Msunduzi municipality speaker, Jabu Ngubo, who was gunned down at his home on New Year’s Eve, said they pray that his spirit fights for justice. Jabulani Mngoma (34) from Edendale in Pietermaritzburg in the KZN midlands, was shot while walking out of the family house. A family member (25) said: “The justice system in this country is poor. It can take a decade for criminals to be arrested. We’re praying that his spirit fights for justice.” She said on the day of the incident Jabulani had told them he was going nowhere as he did not feel safe. She said he further warned the entire family not to leave the premises as that would put their lives in danger as well. “A few seconds to midnight, while everyone was looking forward to crossing over into 2019, we heard him say ‘mama bayangidubula’ (mum they are shooting me). When we looked in the direction of the door, he laid down and was bleeding from his stomach,” she said. She said she rushed to pull him up, but another bullet rang out and she ran for cover. She said with all the poor network signal, an outgoing call looking for help only went through to his colleagues around 2am. “His colleagues rushed him to hospital at about 2am. “When we left him we were hopeful he was going to be okay, but at about 5am, we got a call informing us he was gone,” she said. She said he used to say every now and then that his life was in danger but he wouldn’t get into detail on who exactly he suspected of threatening to have him killed. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said confirmed that a 34-year-old man was at his home in Smero location when an unknown man fired gunshots at him and fled. a case of murder was opened at the Plessislaer Police Station for investigation. Msunduzi municipality speaker, Jabu Ngubo said: “I’m out of words. It feels like God took the other part of me, a person who would take a bullet for me. I pray that God punish the killers.”
