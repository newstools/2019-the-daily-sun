RESIDENTS are now hopeful that crime will decrease after seeing Police Minister Bheki Cele and top cop Khehla Sitole at their shopping centre and taxi rank. Cele and Sitole visited KwaMashu kasi, north of Durban, on Friday. They walked about and talked to residents. Resident Njabulo Mchunu (45) said: “We’re happy to see the minister in our area. This shopping centre has too many thugs and whoonga addicts, so we believe that since the minister has been informed by us about this crime issue, things will change. We believe in him.” Meanwhile, a taximan told the minister they were against Uber and Taxify drivers. Taxi association boss Mzomuhle Radebe said: “Minister, we decided to take their cars because they steal our passengers. “We’re paying for permits and they don’t. They operate on all roads but don’t pay a cent. “We’re appealing with you to meet with us so we can discuss the matter and find a solution.” The minister said: “You should make an appointment so we can meet between 4 and 12 January next year.” They seized drugs and R100 000 in cash, and bust the flat owner. Cele was concerned that the quiet block of flats near the Gateway Shopping Centre had a drug lab. Investigators were still to calculate the drugs’ street value.
