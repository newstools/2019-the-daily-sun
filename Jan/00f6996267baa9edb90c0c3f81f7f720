NEWCASTLE mayor Makhosini Nkosi has refused to say why he resigned without telling the ANC’s provincial leadership. Nkosi resigned as mayor of the northern KZN municipality on Sunday. Yesterday, the council speaker said there would be a special council meeting to table Nkosi’s resignation. Provincial ANC spokesman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu yesterday told the SunTeam the provincial leaders had not yet received his resignation letter. She said in terms of ANC rules, Nkosi must write to provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli to inform him of his resignation. “Nkosi has not told the people who appointed him to the position. The provincial secretary is supposed to tell us about any ANC mayor’s resignation. We don’t know Nkosi’s status,” said Simelane-Zulu. Nkosi confirmed his resignation to Daily Sun in an SMS on Monday but didn’t explain why he had not informed provincial leaders. He confirmed he was joining the Durban Bar Legal Council. Nkosi, who is a lawyer by profession, was appointed mayor in 2016. Sources in the municipality claimed he decided to resign after rumours that he was going to be replaced by regional chairman Ntuthuko Mahlaba and Mahlaba was expected to be appointed but spokesman Dumisani Thabethe said he couldn’t comment.
