HIS music might not be dominating the airwaves, but that doesn’t mean singer Loyiso Bala has completely vanished from the limelight. He is still making moves, but he is doing so in silence. The star had reason to smile after being announced as Director of Channel for TBN Africa. The seven time SAMA award –winner is an accomplished musician, who has cemented his place as one of the best vocalists in Mzansi. So, it’s no wonder that he feels honoured with his new appointment, because it’s something he never envisaged. Having resigned from the board at Sambro, the star takes on a new role an even bigger role and is ready to step in. “I’ve been many things in life, but to be appointed Channel Director for TBN in Africa is the greatest honour,” he announced on his Twitter account. I have been many things in life, but to be appointed as Channel Director for @tbninafrica is the greatest honour! My role will be to lead an experience team in increasing the overall viewer-experience. This includes content creation and strategic scheduling, brand and channel identity, marketing and new business strategies. A post shared by  Loyiso (@loyisobala) on Jan 14, 2019 at 8:07pm PST
