ACTORS Sayitsheni Mdakhi from Isibaya and Motlatsi Mafatshe from Isidingo have formed a movement called the Freeman Brotherhood. It consists of 70 members between the ages of 25 and 40 years. Sayitsheni said it was named in honour of the late Freeman Manzana, who instilled good principles in young men. “We are a circle of friends from high school. “We have a common goal, which is art,” said Sayitsheni. “The movement became stronger when we became comforters during funerals.” In addition to performing as amabhandishi amoya (spiritual comforters) they also get involved in projects dealing with mental health issues, music and the Flo Foundation, which works with children. Member Vusi Tshabalala said they focus on preventing suicides, depression and femicide. “In March, we will host a camp and look at healing mechanisms for emotional challenges,” Vusi said. Motlatsi said the Flo Foundation has given birth to the Phoenix Soccer Club, which is made up of children from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. “During our first programme we invited professional soccer players to teach children to play,” said Motlatsi. He said they have also created a network that brings opportunities to up and coming musicians. “I worked with Siya Shezi on my new single Falling,” said Motlatsi, whose stage name is Momoney. The brotherhood was recently joined by Khuluma Ndoda organisation that is led by veteran actor Patrick Shai and fights against women abuse.
