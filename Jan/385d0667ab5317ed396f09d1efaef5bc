LUNGILE Mkhwanazi (15) is hoping to face this year squarely with two legs planted firmly on the ground. Lungile’s right leg was amputated in February last year after she was diagnosed with cancer. Her father, Jacob Ngwenya (46), from Villa Liza in Ekurhuleni, said Lungile is a grade 8 pupil at Masithwalisane Secondary School in Vosloorus. He said she would struggle to travel by bus. “She will also have trouble going up and down the stairs,” said Jacob. He said he was grateful that his daughter was now pain-free, but he hopes her situation will improve. “She’s been through a lot. It was a terrible year for her and she does not need another year like that,” said Jacob. Lungile’s mom, Mavis Mkhwanazi (37), said she is frantically looking for someone who can help her daughter. “I just want her to have a better life. She has had enough sadness,” said Mavis. Mavis said she had been looking for someone who could transport her child to school. “It might take a while for us to get a leg for her, so for now I will appreciate any help we can get,” she said. Lungile said she just wants to go back to school with two legs. She said the school bus that she takes when she goes to school is always full and the kids push each other.
