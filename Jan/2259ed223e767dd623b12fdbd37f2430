WHEN he bought his bicycle, it was just to get him from one place to another. But now Tshepisang Marumo’s skhothane ride is the talk of the town. He even has aspecial clothes he wears to ride on his pimped up bike. At night, it is hard to distinguish whether an ambulance or cop car is approaching as it has so many lights. It is also hard to miss him, because the bike even has sound. The 29-year-old from Makapanstad, North West pimped his ride into something that has never been seen before. He bought the bike in 2010, but it never represented the type of the person he is. That’s when he decided to add life to it by pimping it. “I started with stickers, but got the idea of adding lights after I fell into a pothole at night,” said Tshepisang. He travels a lot on the bike, so he added a music player and radio so he doesn’t get bored along the way. “I’m able to play music using a USB, memory card or auxiliary cable. It operates through a battery that can be charged any time”. He said it took him more than seven years to pimp his bicycle. “I have spent over R7 000 pimping it and don’t regret a cent because it was worth it.” He said every time he rides his bicycle, people can’t help but ask him about it. “Some people even begged me to pimp their bicycles. I have become a spectacle when I travel on my Kelly B, and people in my community can spot me from the distance.” He said his Kelly B takes him all over and never lets him down.
