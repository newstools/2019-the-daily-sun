LAMONTVILLE Golden Arrows assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi confirmed that the club is interested in signing a goalkeeper in this January transfer window. Arrows, who have not made any signings in this window period, are in need of a goalkeeper reinforcement since Namibian international Maximilian Mbaeva is out injured. This has left the club thin in that department as they only have Nkosingiphile Gumede. Sherwin Naicker, who previously played in the PSL for Jomo Cosmos in 2015/16 season, has yet to feature in this campaign. SunSport insiders have revealed that Arrows are interested in Mamelodi Sundowns “keeper Thela Ngobeni, but they have been put off since Kaizer Chiefs have come into the picture in showing an interest as well.” Ngobeni, who was on loan last season to Free State State Stars, is yet to feature this season. It is highly unlikely he’ll play as coach Pitso Mosimane prefers his number one Denis Onyango, Kennedy Mweene and Reyaad Pieterse in goals. In his first game in charge in a win over Maritzburg United at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium, coach Steve Komphela said he’s not sure how long Mbaeva will be out for and he was looking to fill up that department. “The process is still ongoing and what makes it so difficult is that the candidate that we are looking at recruiting into the club – the other clubs are doing the same,’’ said Ncikazi, who stood in for Komphela. Komphela was still away after attending the memorial service of the late Phil “Chippa’’ Masinga in Jo’burg on Monday. “So there is competition there. But we’ll be content staying with the group that we have, considering the fact that it looks like the recovery of Max Mbaeva is progressing well. “At this current stage, I wouldn’t be sure whether he recovers soon, whether we need a replacement, and also based on the negotiation with the recruit that we want to bring in to the club. “But we were talking to a certain goalkeeper and truly so I know, but I don’t know the progress of negotiations.’’
