RESIDENTS of Lindelani, north of Durban, keep making shocking discoveries. On Friday, people in the area found yet another body of an unknown man with gunshot wounds. They are terrified because three unknown women’s bodies were found in the same area late last year. One body was found in October, another in November and the other last month. Residents fear their area is turning into a dump for dead people. One of the residents told Daily Sun it is causing them a lot of stress. He said it seems the man whose body was found on Friday was shot and then left in the area. “The problem is we don’t know where he was killed. “Perhaps he was killed somewhere else and his body brought to our area. “It’s also possible that he was shot in this area and left to die,” the resident said. He said no one from the area knew who the man was. “Although the body was starting to decompose, he might be recognised by someone who knows him,” said the resident. Another villagert said all the bodies they find are unknown to them. “They are not from our area and this worries us. “We are terrified because whoever kills these people and drops them here could end up killing one of us.” The resident said this also frightned children because they no longer play in the sports field near the area where the bodies were found. KZN cop spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed a case of murder was being investigated by Ntuzuma police after the body of an unknown man was found in Lindelani with gunshot wounds. Gwala said the victim’s identity is still unknown.
