The DA has been heavily criticised for their election billboard which labelled the governing party “murderers” of mine workers and mental health patients. The billboard, which was unveiled by the party on Queen Elizabeth Highway in Joburg on Wednesday, has been described as “insensitive” by many on social media. Many have accused the DA of making a mockery out of the people who lost their lives in those tragedies. Many claim the DA have “run out of ideas” and are desperate for votes with the elections fast approaching. As always, our local celebrities also weighed in on the matter and many of them were less than impressed. Presenter Sizwe Dlhomo tweeted: “All this money on consultants and no one could tell you that this was a bad idea. Adverse selection of focus groups.” TV and radio personality Learto Kganyago said: “The DA does some really bizarre things sometimes. But I did say the campaigns are coming in full force now, some political parties are going to leave us feeling nauseous!” Rapper AKA tweeted: “What if we printed the names of all the people who died under Apartheid and put that on a billboard?” Fellow rapper Casper Nyovest wrote: “This is very insensitive, take it down.”
