WHEN Takati was growing up he used to love watching mlungus revving their bikes on the highways. He used to be teased endless for this fascination but Takai Finha’s fascination meant he didn’t mind making the noise of a bike revving – he would say “ultwa dae deng” and then make the sound of a bike engine with his teeth and tongue to his friends’ amusement. When SunWheels asked him how he handled those amusing moments, he said: “Oh well, I just kept on saying he who laugh last, laughs longest,” he said. Now the 47-year-old road construction worker from Simunye, near Westonaria, west of Joburg, laughs while posing with his black 2004 Honda CBR 125. Q: When did you start riding? A: 2015. Q: How important is your bike? A: I use it to get from Krugersdorp to work and back. It has a good petrol consumption and it’s comfortable. I’m always excited to feel the wind when I ride. Q: Is this your first bike? A: Yes, and it’s my favourite. Q: Do you belong to a bike club? A: No, but I plan to start my own club with other elders from around the West Rand. Q: Do you wish to hold any position? A: I am a grootman. Grootman is a colloquial word that means I am an elder so I would like to start with a senior position such as king or president. Q: What would your role be? A: I would like to teach people to ride for fun but also with discipline on the road. Q: Why did you choose a black bike? A: Because I love black. I even wear black overalls at work. However, wearing black at night is dangerous which is why I wear safety gear covered with white reflective stripes. Q: Are you licensed? A: Yes. Q: Do you have any fines? A: No, I am careful on the road. Q: What do you tell other Mzansi bikers? A: K53 is key for safety as is respecting other road users. Arriving home safely and alive is a simple blessing. Without respect, you threaten your life and the lives of others. Don’t forget to wear your helmet.
