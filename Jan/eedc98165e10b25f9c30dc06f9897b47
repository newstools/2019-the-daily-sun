THE death of legendary disco singer Dan Tshanda has left Mzansi in disbelief. The 55-year-old suffered heart failure on Saturday afternoon and was rushed to the Sandton Mediclinic in Joburg, where he was declared dead. Dan was born in Chiawelo, Soweto, and dropped out of primary school because there was no money. Family spokesman Moudy Mudzielwana told Daily Sun: “Dan never complained about heart problems but three days ago he had a lung X-ray and was given antibiotics.” In 1986, Dan’s first group Splash released an album called Peacock, which became a massive hit. His music was popular in countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Australia, England and France. “He was working on a new album with Splash. We’ll make sure it’s released,” said Moudy. Many on social media criticised South Africans for not celebrating Dan as much as neighbouring countries did. Zenzele wrote on Facebook: “The guy was a legend. May his soul rest in peace.” Scorpion wrote: “Bulawayo will always remember you. Thanks for the music.” Reggae singer Dan Nkosi said: “I worked with him when we were doing bubblegum music. He was a good guy. We will miss him a lot.” Kwaito legend Arthur Mafokate said: “I often visited him at his home in Chiawelo to be inspired.” Musician Joe Shirimani said he was really sad to hear the news: “May his soul rest in peace.” Dan is survived by his wife and three children. He will be buried in Gauteng. The date has not yet been confirmed.
