JUSTICE Minister Michael Masutha on New Year’s Eve listened to women jailbirds in Kimberley, Northern Cape and North West relate their jailhouse blues. He gave jailed mums presents – one at Kimberley Prison and the other at Potchefstroom Prison. An inmate from Botswana complained that the process to grant him parole was taking too long. But Masutha said parole was not automatic. The parole board looked at behaviour, the state of rehabilitation, and the feelings of crime victims. Another inmate told Masutha she laid a criminal charge against 10 prison warders who had moered her, but the case had stalled. He took down her details and said he did not condone inmates being assaulted. Some prisoners said they were studying but had not received NSFAS funding. Masutha ordered officials to assist those who needed funding. He said all profiles of female prisoners were studied to find out why they were in jail. Some were convicted for killing spouses after experiencing abuse, while others killed them for money. “These cases must be treated on individual merit,” he said. He said parole boards should not use his name as an excuse for not completing parole processes. He only looked at life term convicts.
