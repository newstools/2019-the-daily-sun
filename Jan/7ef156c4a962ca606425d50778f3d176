REVEREND Olaotse Moremi went into the ministry to save lives – but now he believes his life might be in danger. Angry congregants came into the church with booze and danced to house music. Reverend Moremi, from a church in Hebron, North West, said when he took to the pulpit last year, he discovered the church was in debt. When he asked for a financial statement, members of the congregation started disrupting the church services. “At first they sprayed water in the church during the service and swore at me,” he said. “Then they played loud music in their cars, took out cooler boxes and danced while cursing me.” The reverend said last Sunday they drove into the church’s garage and played loud music. “One of them came inside the house and swore at me. “When I didn’t reply they started vandalising a house in the building. “They tied ropes on the burglar bars and pulled them out of the wall with their bakkie.” He said one of the men even tried to strangle his wife. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said cases of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and malicious damage to property were opened. No arrests have been made.
