PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has dismissed rumours that there is tension between him and former president Jacob Zuma. Addressing thousands of ANC supporters at the party’s 107th birthday part at JL Dube Stadium in eThekwini yesterday, he said he and Zuma were friends. Ramaphosa said he regarded former presidents Thabo Mbeki, Kgalema Motlanthe and Zuma as his sources of wisdom. This came after newspaper reports over the weekend claimed Ramaphosa was planning on confronting Zuma over divisive tweets he had been posting lately. Zuma posted videos where he appeared to take views different from the ANC’s on the land issue. He proposed nationalisation, which goes against ANC policy. Ramaphosa said the ANC held its birthday party in eThekwini to report to founding president John Dube what the party had been doing since he died in 1946. Ramaphosa also laid a wreath on Dube’s grave. She visited Addington Hospital in Durban and surprised the mums of one boy and three girls born yesterday, with clothes and blankets. Dlamini said: “This is the day this organisation was born to set black Africans free. This is a very important day and should be celebrated by everyone.”
