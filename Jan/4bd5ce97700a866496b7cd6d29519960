YESTERDAY the DA launched its voter registration campaign at Chris Hani Baragwanath Taxi Rank in Soweto. Registration weekend will take place on 26 and 27 January. DA leader Mmusi Maimane and Gauteng premier candidate Solly Msimanga addressed supporters at the launch before putting up posters near the rank. Msimanga told members they must ensure the posters can be seen on every corner. He said the party will create an economy that works for all and ensure there is law and order to attract investment. “I want people to know we will work to ensure service delivery is improved,” he said. “Our track record shows that where we govern, services are improved and delivered.” Maimane encouraged voters to be more active. “We need to stand up for a South Africa where you don’t have to belong to a certain race to be in a particular party. “When we say one South Africa, it should be land ownership for all.” He said the DA was not going to be populist on the land issue, unlike its political rivals. “The choice is between an ANC of corruption and a DA that brings the change we need.” Taxi owner Elias Khoza (58) said: “All I want is for government to ensure foreigners don’t come in and out of Mzansi as they please.”
