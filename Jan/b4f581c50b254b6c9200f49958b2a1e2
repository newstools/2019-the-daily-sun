Black Leopards striker Mwape Musonda has lauded Coach Dylan Kerr for the impact he has had on his personal game since he joined the club. The 52-year-old coach has hit the ground running in the Premier Soccer League, taking Lidoda Duvha from the relegation zone to 12th on the log. The Englishman’s efforts have seen him named the PSL coach of the month of December, beating Gavin Hunt, Pitso Mosimane and Benny McCarthy to the award. Also central to Leopards’ recent success is striker Musonda who has scored eight goals and is currently the leading scorer in the league so far this campaign. Musonda, who was voted the player of the month, just can't stop scoring and has helped Leopards go 9 points clear of bottom team Maritzburg United and the dreaded relegation zone. The Zambian has credited Kerr for his recent rich vein of form which has seen him have his best goal return in the PSL. “He (Kerr) keeps me motivated,” said Musonda. “When he first came to the club he told me that he would make me the top goal scorer and I think we are moving in the right direction. “I’m just happy to have him right now as a coach, he pushes me to work hard and that’s exactly what I’m doing.” The former Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows striker says he is not getting carried away by the amount of goals he has scored and he is aiming for more. “8 goals after fifteen games is not a number that satisfies me, if I’m going to be excited by that then it means I don’t know what I’m doing as a striker. “I’ve got to keep calm, keep working hard and hoping to score more which I’m confident will happen, I’ll keep scoring goals.”
