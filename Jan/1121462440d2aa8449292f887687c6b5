TEBOGO says government has forgotten him even though he’s applied for an RDP house for over 14 years without any luck. Blind Tebogo Kgosi (55) from Bochabela in Mangaung started applying for an RDP in 2005. He claimed he visited the local municipal offices regularly to check if his application was successful but was always told his application was not approved. He told Daily Sun: “I was shocked when I went to check how far my application had gone and they said I didn’t appear on the system. “I don’t know what went wrong or who messed up the application, but now instead of getting a house, I have to re-apply. “They must fix what they did. I am tired of paying rent. My disability grant is not enough to pay for these things and I need a home. “I am blind and where will I go if the owner evicts me?” Tebogo said government doesn’t care about people. “They only know us when they want our votes. I was born in the Free State but I don’t have a place to live. The money I get is not enough to buy a site and build a house,” he said. Human Settlements spokeswoman Senne Bogatsu said: “Unfortunately, Tebogo does not appear on our system. “This might be due to the fact that he does not have a site. “We advise him to ask his local municipal office to be placed on the national housing needs register, where his housing needs will be registered.”
