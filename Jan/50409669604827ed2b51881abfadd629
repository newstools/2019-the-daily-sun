The club also released NigerianInternational defender James Okwuosa who is currently training with Highlands Park, hoping to secure a contract. According to a source close to the Port Elizabeth side, coach Joel Masuthatravelled to East London for their opening Absa Premiership match in the new year with only 18 players. Said the Source: “Management is worried that results are not forthcoming. Hence they released those deemed surplus torequirement. The coach had only 18 players in Mdantsane. Others are finalising their releases.” Mokeke is at Town City on a pre-contract. He was recruited, together with Tim by coach Eric Tinkler last October, but they could not hold on to their job after the former Orlando Pirates mentor was fired in November due to poor results. Added the source: “Mokeke was due to join Cape Town City in July, but management wants to release him now as he is no longer part of the coach’s plan. Nthethe is also no longer part of the team and has stopped training. Management is negotiating his release as his contract expires at the end of season.”
