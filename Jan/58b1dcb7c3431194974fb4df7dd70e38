PICTURES of Iyavaya hitmaker L’vovo Derrango carrying a gun dominated his Facebook timeline this week. But the much loved actor and singer said he’s against guns, war and violence. “I’m acting! I’m not planning on killing anyone. I’m calling for an end to killing, including taxi violence, hostel shootings and all kinds of violent crime.” L’vovo, whose real name is Thokozani Ndlovu, has been showing himself as the character he plays on Mzansi Magic’s brand new local drama eHostela, which tells the story of assassins (izinkabi) in hostels. “I’m not promoting violence but telling a story,” he said. “We need a society that is patient and tolerant. Killing the next person won’t get us anywhere.” The drama, which airs on Sundays at 8pm, is set at the KwaMashu Hostel, north of Durban. The hostel is famous for housing the most dangerous gangsters and izinkabi. In August, a cop was shot dead and another injured, reportedly in a shooting between police and gunmen. L’vovo said: “Today people are scared to visit hostels because of their bad reputation.” Last year L’vovo held a braai day for taxi owners and drivers. He said: “I wanted to remind them that they also play an important role in our communities and in our daily lives.” Series director Mqondisi Ngubane said scriptwriter Mthunzi Dubazana spent time engaging with KwaMashu hostel residents. Mqondisi said: “Hostel residents also have goals and aspirations. They have families and children who go to school.” Apart from telling stories of assassins, the drama also educates. “It shows that those who live by the gun die by the gun,” said Ngubane.
