WHEN residents saw a man sitting in a car at the local dump, they thought he was waiting for his girlfriend. But when no one was watching the man made a strange delivery. He took a coffin out of his car and left it at the dumpsite in Kameeldrift, Tshwane, on Tuesday before speeding off. By the time the community realised what was going on, the man was long gone. Frightened residents said the coffin looked as if it had been dug out of a grave because there was sand inside it. Resident Beulah Matome (40) said: “Maybe a serial killer is in town and is making us aware of his presence. Who buys a coffin just to dump it?” She said residents were scared. “Parents keep their children at home and by 8pm there’s no one on the streets,” she said. Melvin Nong (30) said the culprit must be caught. “Grieving families pay a lot of money to bury their loved ones with dignity, but thieves steal from them,” he said. Prophet Makgonatjohle Seaparo said the coffin was attracting bad luck. “The community must pray or consult healers to get rid of the evil brought by the coffin,” he said. Police spokeswoman Constable Mavis Sindane said cops are waiting for experts to find out whether the coffin was dug up.
