FOR many this day is terrifying, as they have to leave their parents at home and get to experience school life for the first time. Tumi Mosala (5) could not hold back her tears of fear in the new environment at Batho Primary School on the first day. Reatlegile Morake (6) was over the moon and walked like a modeler on her way to Batho Primary School in Batho kasi, Mangaung on Wednesday. Amo Mothibe (5) cried on his first day at school at Batho Primary School in Batho kasi, Mangaung. Meanwhile for Ofentse Cindi (5) and Thembile Mati (5) it was friendship at first sight when the trio met on their first day at school at Mangaung Primary School in Batho kasi.
