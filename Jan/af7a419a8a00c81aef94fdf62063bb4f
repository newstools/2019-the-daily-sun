THE IEC welcomes President Cyril Ramaphosa’s signing into law of the Political Party Funding Act. Yesterday, CEO Sy Mamabolo said they were already preparing for relevant sections of the act to be applied from 1 April. “Drafting regulations relating to the aspects of the act are already under way, and it’s expected they will be published for people’s comment before the end of next month.” Mamabolo said political parties and private donors will be trained. He said if any party failed to say who their donors were, they face consequences. Speaking about the IEC’s readiness for final voter registration, he said the country’s 22 925 voting stations would be open from 8am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday. He said there are 26 million registered voters on the national voters’ roll and the IEC hoped at least one million extra would be added.
