LEBOGANG is feeling much better thanks to the Lesedi 7 Group! This after the printing company was touched by Lebogang’s story, which the People’s Papar published last Tuesday. Four-year-old Lebogang Mokale was diagnosed with intestinal tuberculosis, which caused his stomach to grow. His mum Keneilwe Mokale (40) told Daily Sun that not only was her son getting an education and nutrition sponsorship, they also received toiletries, a blanket and R2 550 for petrol. She got R2 000 for additional needs such as transport money for her to visit her son daily, pyjamas, a gown, underwear, socks and sleepers. “I’m grateful to Daily Sun and the Lesedi 7 Group for helping us. “I now have more faith that things will be okay,” said Keneilwe. She said her son was stable and under treatment at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. “Lesedi 7 has given us comfort. Even my boy is happy. He hasn’t been cured as yet but we will get there.” Keneilwe’s neighbour Paul Makhale has been going up and down seeking help for Lebogang. He expressed how grateful he was to Daily Sun and the company. “The company has given us hope. The boy is under the watchful eyes of doctors, who have a treatment plan for recovery. Thank you, Lesedi 7 Group, you have helped us a lot. “I hope you continue to better the lives of others,” said Paul. The company’s director, Lesedi Mapheto, said they were touched when they heard about Lebogang’s plight, as his medical condition prevented him from enjoying his childhood. He said they didn’t hesitate to reach out to the boy’s family to identify their immediate needs. Lesedi told  Daily Sun  they were relieved Lebogang was finally receiving medical assistance.
