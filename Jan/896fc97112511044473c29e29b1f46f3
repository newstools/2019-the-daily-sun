THESE residents say they are forced to collect water from puddles when it rains. The people of Ficksburg in the Free State have been living with a water crisis for many years. Resident Disebo Moloi (54) said: “I rely on water to make milk for my three-month-old baby. Every day I hope there will be water at the mine hole I collect from. I sometimes have to walk 10km to fetch water. I have even stopped using the toilet and have been relieving myself in a hole I dug in the yard. “We have been having water problems since November. I understand our town doesn’t have enough water, but the municipality has to at least send water trucks.” Disebo said although it was unsafe to drink water from mine holes and puddles, she had no other choice. Thabiso Tlali said residents were living like pigs. “We drink any water we see because there is nothing else. I’m afraid if the municipality doesn’t find a solution, residents will strike again.” Setsoto municipal manager Tshepiso Ramakarane confirmed there was a water crisis in the Ficksburg area. “Our dams are below 50% and we have been getting water from Clocolan. Last month, our water reservoir was vandalised and pumps were stolen, which led to the water being cut. We are trying to make plans for our people to have running water.”
