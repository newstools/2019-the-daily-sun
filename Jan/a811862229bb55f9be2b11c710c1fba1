NCEBAKAZI Sobai (30) is a detergent manufacturer who is aiming to conquer the industry. The former hawker from Zimbane Village in Mthatha started making detergent in 2009 and used to sell it at her stall. Ncebekazi dropped out of high school when she fell pregnant and struggled to find a job. But now she is own her boss and has two permanent employees at her factory. Ncebakazi said she developed an interest in business while she was working for a cleaning company. “When my contract expired I realised I could make more money as a hawker,” she said. At first she used to make detergent in her RDP house and sell it in the streets of Mthatha. Now she sells products such as foam bath and dishwashing liquid to schools, surgeries and private clients. “Every day I work to ensure my products are the best.” At one point Ncebekazi almost called it quits. “I once spent R6 500 on a course, only to find that it wasn’t accredited. “Then OR Tambo mayor Nomakhosazana Meth helped me get funding. I’m grateful.” Ncebekazi was able to secure R750 000 in funding. She called on the government to support budding businesses as it is hard to get started.
