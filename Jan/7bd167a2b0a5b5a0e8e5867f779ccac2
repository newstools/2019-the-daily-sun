ANGRY Tshwane residents are demanding answers after it has come to light that a fourth person died in the stampede at the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church on 28 December. Mary Msisa from Phalaborwa, Limpopo, was identified by her family last Friday after they received a call on Thursday about her death. After the news broke about Mary’s death, the South African National Civic Organisation led a protest at the church on Friday. They called for Prophet Shepherd Bushiri, originally from Malawi, to pack up and go. The protesters barricaded the entrance to the church with burning tyres. Portia Mokwena, regional secretary of the civic organisation in Tshwane, said Bushiri owed the nation answers and vowed the church would not operate until he explained what had happened. She said the church’s lawyers wanted to disguise the matter as a xenophobic attack on its leader. Police spokeswoman Captain Augustina Selepe said Bushiri and his congregation were facing charges of defeating the ends of justice and interfering with police work, because they allegedly failed to report the incident to the cops after moving the bodies of the women to a private mortuary. Bushiri’s spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said: “The church is working with the police to make sure everything is addressed to the letter.”
