SOUTH Africa Under-20 national team coach Thabo Senong is hoping to have all 34 players in camp by Thursday. Amajita will play in the Afcon finals to take place in Niger from 2-17 February. They are in Group A with host Niger, Nigeria and Burundi. On Wednesday Amajita travelled to Nelspruit in Mpumalanga, where their preparation camp will be based. Coach Senong named a provisional squad of 34 players and currently, 24 players have reported to camp. The other 10 players, some of whom are based overseas, are expected to join the team in Mpumalanga. Senong hopes to conquer Africa by finishing in top four as that will see them automatically qualifying for the Under-20 Fifa World Cup. The tournament will be played in Poland from 23 May to 15 June. Coach Senong said: “I just want to start by thanking all the clubs that have released their players. For day one in the camp, we have 24 players and for me it’s a good number. “We expect to have all the players reporting for the camp on Thursday.” Senong has already scheduled friendlies to ensure his charges are physically and mentally ready for the competition. “With the players we have now, we can start building and fine tuning our tactical base and give them ideas of how we are going to play, and prepare them for the mental demands they are going to face in Niger,” Senong added. “We are departing to Nelspruit where we will have two good friendlies over the weekend. We will come back to Johannesburg to have our final preparations before we fly to West Africa on 23 January”
