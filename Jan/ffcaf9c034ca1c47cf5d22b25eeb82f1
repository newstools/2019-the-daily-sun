DEPUTY transport minister Sindisiwe Chikunga is calling on people to support road safety. She was speaking at the funeral service of Mpumalanga Community Safety spokesman Joseph Mabuza at the Communio Church in Mbombela on Saturday. The service was attended by Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni, community safety MEC Pat Ngomane, Lieutenant- General Mondli Zuma and North West and KwaZulu-Natal safety MECs. Mabuza died along the N4 at Hectorspruit near Komatipoort last Sunday on his way from an assignment. People think a fugitive may have carried out a reckless U-turn on the busy road, causing the serious crash, where Mabuza died on a motorbike. The unknown driver disappeared. Chikunga said drunk driving, recklessness and drunk pedestrians contribute to the country’s increasing road accidents. She said 144 people died last Monday and Tuesday. “I knew Joe and am touched. We are here to bid farewell to an ambassadors we were robbed of. “Take up the spear of this fallen road safety warrior to battle against this carnage he fought with such passion.” She said the department will increase safety awareness campaigns so people can know what causes the high number of road deaths. Joseph’s wife Winnie Mabuza has called on the provincial commissioner to help them find closure. Ngomane said investigations are at an advanced stage. “We have positive information. We will catch that person before long.”
