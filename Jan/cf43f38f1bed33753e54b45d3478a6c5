 King Monada is an angry man. This is after music promoter dribbled past the Malwedhe
hit maker King Monada. In a video tweeted by controversial Twitter character Adv
Barry Roux Monada could be heard complaining about the money. He says he was booked to perform and was sent proof of
payment. But after the performance he received only R26 in his
bank account instead of the promised R26Â 000. He is heard advising other musicians to not accept proof
of payments.
