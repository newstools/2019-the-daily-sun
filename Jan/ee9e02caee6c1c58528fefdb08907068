A point away is better than nothing! This was the comment of Baroka FC captain Mduduzi Mdantsane following Bakgaga’s 2-2 draw with Cape Town City in an Absa Premiership match played at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. “It’s not easy to play against Cape Town City in their backyard,” said Mdantsane. “We went there for maximum points, but we couldn’t get them. But we can take a point.” Mdantsane blames themselves for making silly mistakes that allowed the Citizens to grab a point. The Limpopo side was leading 2-1 with only five minutes to the end of game when Roland Putsche scored to deny them three points. “I think we could have won this game despite being difficult. We made some silly mistakes at the last minute and allowed them to score,” he explained. “But we are pleased with the performance as it was better compared to the Black Leopards game (lost 2-0). All of us gave our best and I am pleased with our performance.” Baroka are 14th on the log with 15 points from 17 games. But the 24-year-old striker is optimistic that they will move out of the danger zone soon and is appealing to their fans not to panic. “We are aware that the second round is very difficult,” said Mdantsane “Now our aim is to fight for maximum points in all our coming games. All we have to do is to work hard and give our best for this club. We have made history by winning the Telkom Knockout and we want to continue doing well.” However Baroka face another tough test against title contender Orlando Pirates in their next league match on 22 January (7.30pm) at Orlando Stadium. “We are not scared of any team,” said Mdantsane. “We’ll beat them like we did in the Telkom Knockout final! All we need to do is go there with a positive mentality. It’s all about three points now and we don’t care who we face.”
