THEIR ancestors have been resting peacefully for years, but they’re now under attack. Residents of Springs, Ekurhuleni, said miners at Canyon Coal are digging close to the graves, disturbing the dead. Community leader Moses Khoza said the company just cared about profit and not the residents’ concerns. “The graves belong to families who come here to perform rituals and the company has to respect that. “It will be sad for them to find their loved ones’ graves destroyed.” Philani Nxumalo, another community leader, said the graves had been there for years and some people who worked at the mine were buried there. “The coal mine was abandoned, but Canyon recently started to mine there again,” he said. “We’re worried that the miners will eventually destroy the graves. “We know some of the people who buried their loved ones there. “We also appeal to people who’ve buried their loved ones at this site to come forward.” Neslihan Er Ogur, a spokeswoman for the mine, said they will bring the matter to the attention of the relevant departments. But municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe told Daily Sun the graves were on private property.
