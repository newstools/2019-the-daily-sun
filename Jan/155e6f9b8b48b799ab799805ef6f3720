AN axe-wielding thug allegedlysowed terror in his kasi. He would break into houses in the day and steal the valuables people had worked hard for. But on Wednesday he targeted the wrong house and ended up paying with his life. The owner of the house in the Coolbreeze section of Duduza, Ekurhuleni, and his two sons were home and bust the thug. They sjambokked him to teach him a lesson and he later died of his injuries. All three have since been arrested. Community leader Mandla Makhubo claims Siyabonga Mavuso (23) used to terrorise the community. “He was beaten up several times by residents but the next day he would go back to stealing,” said Mandla. Siyabonga’s aunt Ntombizodwa Mavuso admitted he was what she called “naughty”. “He was beaten up by residents of Bluegum section last year. He came back home after that but left again,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said the owner of the house saw Siyabonga entering his yard with an axe. “He blew a whistle to alert the community. The suspect ran away but was chased by residents. “He was stopped and lashed with a sjambok until he died,” he said. Ramphora said the suspects were charged with murder. They are due to make an appearance in Tsakane Magistrates Court today.
