MATHABO Letsoha started her recycling work in 2004 after her husband died and left her with 10 kids. The 60-year-old from Khayelitsha in Mangaung said: “None of my kids is working. “They depend on the money I make.” She said she goes from kasi to kasi to collect empty bottles, cans and plastic and then sells it at scrapyards. “Whether hot or cold, I go to the dump sites because I know if I sleep, no one will help me,” she said. “When I’ve finished collecting the scrap, the truck comes to collect it on Saturday. “I collect four bags a week and depending on the weight, it gives me R300.” She said when her husband left her with so many kids to support, she had to look for a way to make money because she never had a formal job. “I remembered God gave me two hands and a brain and went to work. “Now I am able to put food on the table,” Mathabo said. “I am working with my daughter-in-law Dimakatso Mokhosi. “She also has three kids to feed. “As women, we have a lot of challenges. “To work for my kids at my age is not easy but I can’t just watch my kids suffering because they cannot get work. “I advise other women to wake up and work while their husbands are alive, so they are not left stranded.”
