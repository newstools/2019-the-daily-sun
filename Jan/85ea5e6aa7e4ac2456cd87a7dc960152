MPUMALANGA police are looking for suspects who planted dagga in the Barberton Nature Reserve with an estimated street value of R21,9 million. On Thursday, an operation was carried out by a team to destroy the plantation. Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said members of various police units and defence force members, as well as Songimvelo Reserve rangers, destroyed the plants. Mpumalanga commissioner, Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma, said: “Our priority is to keep our communities safe and clear of any kind of danger”. Zuma said follow-up operations will be carried out as and when dagga fields are identified. Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane has called on residents to help police bust the suspects who planted the dagga. “We need to bring the culprits to book because drugs destroy the morals of our society. “We have to rid our communities of drug dealers who are only interested in making money at the expense of the wellbeing of our young people.” He said dagga contributed to many social ills.
