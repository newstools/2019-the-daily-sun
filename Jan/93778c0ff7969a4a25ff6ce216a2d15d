ATTACKS on cops are an undeclared war against the state. Police Minister Bheki Cele, said this at the funeral of Port Elizabeth flying squad member Constable Dwane Kemp (31) at the NG Kerk Hoogland in Charlo, Port Elizabeth on Saturday. “If you attack a police officer, you attack the state. This pain of killing our police officers must end,” he said. Kemp died in hospital last Monday after being shot in the stomach during an armed robbery at Le Bon Bakery in Central Port Elizabeth. His partner, Constable Musa Hans returned fire, killing four suspects in the bakery. A fifth suspect fled and is still being hunted by police. Cele said: “Kemp has died on behalf of the nation. “We see him as a hero. “Heroes don’t die, because they live on in our memory. “The family must walk tall and be proud of this fallen hero. “As police minister, I am very proud of Kemp.” Holding her daughter Jadyn in her arms, Dwane’s widow Candice said: “We have lost the pillar of strength in our family.” Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga extended her condolences to Kemp’s family. “You will be in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,” she said. Ntshinga said no stone will be left unturned to bring the fifth suspect to book.
