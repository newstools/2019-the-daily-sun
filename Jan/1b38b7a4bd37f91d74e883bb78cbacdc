SIYABONGA Mocwagae resigned from work two years ago to follow her dreams. Today the 54-year-old from Matsikeng Village in QwaQwa runs a thriving egg business. After starting her business with only four chickens at her home, the former hospital lab technician now has over 400 hens. “I’ve always been a go getter and after seeing a gap in the egg market in my area, I took the opportunity and bought a piece of land,” she told Daily Sun. “I first started selling eggs and chickens part time but after I realised my eggs were in high demand, I resigned from work. Running a business has always been my passion. Business is good because I now produce about 390 eggs a day. “I used to supply chain stores like Spar but now my focus is on the local market. “Nothing in my business goes to waste. I also sell chicken manure to people who have vegetable gardens as fertiliser. I sell 10kg of manure for R10.” Siyabonga said it was good for people to have their own businesses but it did take up time. “At the moment I have one helper. “But the aim is to open my doors to people who want to learn how to produce eggs or farm chickens. “I see myself exporting eggs one day,” she said.
