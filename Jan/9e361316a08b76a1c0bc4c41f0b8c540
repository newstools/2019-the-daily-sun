POLICE are investigating a case of arson after the ANC offices in Sedibeng, south of Joburg, burnt down yesterday morning. But ANC members are pointing fingers at each other. In recent months the organisation has been rocked by infighting and factional battles. Named after struggle hero Duma Nokwe, the building in Vereeniging was damaged a few days after the party was rumoured to have appointed local pastor Gift Moerane as the new mayor of Emfuleni. A source said faction fights might have led to the burning of the office. “The problem did not start now. There is factionalism in the region and many comrades do not see eye to eye,” said the source. Gauteng executive council spokeswoman Tasneem Motara condemned the incident. She refused to comment about the alleged factionalism Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said no arrests had been made yet. “No one was injured, and the cause of the fire will be revealed later,” he said.
