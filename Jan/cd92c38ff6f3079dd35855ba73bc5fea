Sangoma Bethuel Nobunga  claims cops moer him for nothing! The 46-year-old from Hluvukani in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said cops accused him of having a gun. But the father of seven said he does not own one. “I was asleep when a group of cops woke me up on 18 December at about 10pm. “They accused me of having a gun. They had no name tags. They pointed their guns at me before dragging me by my pants into the kitchen,” he said. Bethuel said others ransacked his entire house searching for a gun, but came back empty-handed. “They punched and kicked me until I fainted on the floor. They drove off in an unmarked van with no registration numbers, leaving me with multiple injuries.” He claims this was not the first time he was attacked by cops. In 2015, heavily armed cops allegedly pounced on him while he was sleeping and accused him of having money made from rhino poaching. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini said: “The case is currently still under investigation. “The 2015 case was instigated and forwarded to the director of prosecution for a decision. The director declined to prosecute and the case was then closed.”
