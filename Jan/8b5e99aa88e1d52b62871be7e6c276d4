THABO Ncamane (58) hates himself for the way he treats his sister 
Agnes (61). He said he is filled with evil and fights with her when he gets 
drunk. He also steals her epilepsy medicine and smokes it, which doesn’t 
make the problem any easier. Thabo and Agnes share a shack in Hostel 1, Mangaung. Thabo said he has been going to church to change his ways. “I’ve advised my sister to go to an old age home because I trouble 
her when I’m drunk,” he said. Agnes said when Thabo is sober, they bond like twins. “But when he is drunk he turns into a monster. “I have tried to tell him stay away from alcohol but he can’t,” she 
said. “He even tried to go to church but afterwards, started 
drinking. “When I called police, he ran away and came back five days 
later.” She said he must find himself another place. “This is our home. “I’m not going anywhere. “He must go away until he can live with me. “He even stole my money,” she said. Thabo told Daily Sun he has tried to stop drinking 
and denied stealing the medicine. “I never steal my sister’s medication. She forgets where she left 
it and accuses me of stealing.” He said when he’s drunk he does things that he forgets the 
following day. “I think evil is using me because, when I am drunk, I fight my 
sister for no reason.
