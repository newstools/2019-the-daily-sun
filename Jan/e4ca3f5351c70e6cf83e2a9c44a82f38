FRAUDSTERS have found a way to bring down Mamelodi Sundowns. The phones of staff members were hacked. Team manager Peter Ndlovu, coach Pitso Mosimane and goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene were victims of a scam and their family members and friends were asked for cash. Sundowns took to social media to alert supporters to the scam. “Alert, coach Pitso Mosimane, Peter Ndlovu and Kennedy Mweene’s phones have all been hacked. Don’t send money to the scammers,” read their tweet. Sundowns spokesman Thulani Thuswa said: “It happens to all PSL clubs and most celebrities. “Lately this is happening to Sundowns the most. What have network providers done? “Absolutely nothing. “Customers are not protected. Family members and close friends are at risk of being taken advantage of.” He said they have been reporting the cases to the police, but nothing happened. “No arrests, nothing. It has been happening for years now.”
