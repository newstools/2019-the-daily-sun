MUSICIANS reminded Daily Sun that Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi died exactly a year after Hugh Masekela. The two were working on a joint album before Bra Hugh died. Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse said: “Bra Hugh probably said ‘come and join me. Let’s finish the album we started’.” Hotstix said interacting with a legend such as Mtukudzi was an honour. “I met Tuku in the UK long before he was known in South Africa. “No one was as generous with their time and music as he was. “He was a humble soul. You could hear it in his music.” Jazz legend Gloria Bosman said: “It’s amusing that he chose to depart on the day we were talking about Masekela’s anniversary. “I’m sure his welcome in heaven will be very warm.” Award-winning musician Mbuso Khoza said: “We need more artists like him to advance our culture. He was great.” Singer and guitarist Berita Khumalo said she didn’t think Tuku would die so soon because he sang for three hours when they shared a stage in Botswana. Berita said: “He was a father and a friend. “He gave me an opportunity five years ago and said he saw great talent in me.” She shared the stage with Tuku last year.
