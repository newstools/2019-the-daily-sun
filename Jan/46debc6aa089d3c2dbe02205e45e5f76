A MAN (41) accused of fondling a 12-year-old girl spent half of Sunday night between power lines. He stood at the top of a pylon behind the new school being built in Caleb Motshabi, Mangaung. He remained on top of the pylon from about 4pm until he was rescued just before midnight on Sunday. His family prayed at the scene and begged God to save his life. Police, firefighters and paramedics at the scene waited for the power to be cut before they began rescue operations. Hundreds of residents pleaded with the man to climb down. The man’s mum (71) told Daily Sun she left him with her 12-year-old granddaughter. “When I came back the girl had run to our neighbour. “I heard my son had fondled the child and asked her to go to his room. “He said he would use a condom,” said the mum. She said she alerted the community and heard he was trying to commit suicide. “I pleaded with the community not to beat him up, but I wanted him to leave.” The man was rescued at about 11.40pm. Lele Mamatu, spokesman for electricity supplier Centlec, said: “We were forced to switch off the power supply on the eastern side of the city and communities were inconvenienced for about two hours.” Police spokesman Constable Peter Kareli said: “A hostage negotiator climbed up to talk to the man. No case has been opened yet.” The man was taken to hospital.
