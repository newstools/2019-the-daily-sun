FOUR burnt bodies were found next to the railway line at Sweet Home squatter camp, in Cape Town. Resident Zikhona Mbatsha (45) told Daily Sun the dead men had been terrorising the community. “They used to rob people but I don’t know who burnt them to death. We knew that one day they’d meet their match and that someone would deal with them,” said Zikhona. Another resident, Zukisani Magopheni, said on Wednesday morning one of the suspects was caught by angry residents but he didn’t know it would end so badly. “Residents were asking him about his other friends and he was crying,” Zukisani said. Another resident said it was useless to report thugs to the cops because the criminals didn’t stay in jail for long. “From now on this is the only way we will deal with thugs because they know that even if they’re arrested, they don’t stay in jail,” said a resident. “We are losing our valuable things to these criminals.” Limise Mayongo (36) said the dead were beaten before being set alight. “These thieves were breaking into people’s shacks to steal things. “It hurts to work so hard only to lose your things to thugs,” said Limise. “We just heard that one of the dead was originally from the Eastern Cape. “He had fled from his kasi because of his bad behaviour.” Cops said circumstances surrounding the incident were being investigated and a case had been opened. Anyone with information about the incident should call Samora Machel Police Station on 021 380 3484, 021 380 3490 or 08600 10111.
