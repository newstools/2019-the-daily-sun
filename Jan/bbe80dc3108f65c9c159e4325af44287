A 39-year-old woman was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport
after she was allegedly found in possession of drugs worth R3.3 million. She was en-route to Cape Town from Sao Paolo via O.R Tambo
International Airport. “Her check-in luggage was intercepted by members of the
South African Revenue Service’s Customs and Excise and taken to the search
area,” Lieutenant-Colonel Katlego Mogale said. The suspect reportedly denied having checked in luggage.  “Upon searching the luggage, three blocks wrapped in black
plastic which were further wrapped in blankets were found inside. Preliminary testing confirmed the contents of the blocks to
be illegal drugs weighing over 10kg, with an estimated street value of R3.3
million,” Mogale said. Mogale said the
multi-disciplinary approach into safety and security at OR Tambo International
Airport continues to yield results. He said the community is encouraged to call the Crime Stop
number 086 00 10111 with any information that can assist in combatting of
crime.
