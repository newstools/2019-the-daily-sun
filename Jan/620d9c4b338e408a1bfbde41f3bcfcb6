AFTER a tough test in two friendly matches against Netherlands and Sweden, Banyana Banyana mentor Desiree Ellis is now looking at fine-tuning her team in the Cyprus Women’s Cup next month. The 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations runners up played two friendlies against the world beaters. Coach Ellis was impressed with their display, especially in the second match where they held Sweden to a goalless draw at Cape Town Stadium. Last year Sweden thumped Banyana 3-0, but it was a different story this time around because Banyana seemed to be better prepared. “I thought we stood up well. “We could have won the Sweden game,” Ellis said. “We are happy, not just with the performance, but the fitness level too. “Against Sweden last year, we fell off in the first half due to fatigue.” Banyana’s started their 2019 Fifa Women’s World Cup preparations with a 2-1 defeat against Netherlands on Saturday. The SA women’s team will be making their debut in this year’s Women’s World Cup set for France on 7 June to 7 July. Banyana will continue with their preparations in Cyprus next month for the Cyprus Women’s Cup, which is set to take place on 25 February to 7 March. “We’re looking at improving all the time,” Ellis added.
