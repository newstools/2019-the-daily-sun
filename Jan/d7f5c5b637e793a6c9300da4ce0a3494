Nowadays, when a pair of young people have been together for a certain amount of time, there’s a step that they take which didn’t exist five years ago. It's way before getting engaged; definitely after making it social media official; and just before moving in together. A joint Instagram account! Following in the recent footsteps of rapper, Nasty C and his bae, Sammy, another celebrity couple has officially opened their joint Insta account. Rapper, Priddy Ugly and dancer, Bontle Modiselle have now opened their own account. The account, @official.rickjade, is an amalgamation of their names, Richardo ‘Priddy Ugly’ Moloi and Bontle Jade-Lee Modiselle. ICYMI: NASTY C'S RELATIONSHIP GETS ITS OWN INSTA ACCOUNT In the bio of their account, the couple says “#RickJade4eva “, leaving us all wondering what all of this could mean. Adding to the speculation is the use of the words “coming soon” on their joint account as well as their personal accounts. Are they getting married? Is Bontle pregnant? Are they working on a new project together? Or are they seeking attention (right up Priddy Ugly’s ally)? Nobody knows as yet but we are keep our eye on the situation. The joint account only has two pics at the moment but is already sitting on almost 2.8K followers. BONTLE MODISELLE OPENS UP ABOUT HER BODY INSECUTIRIES RickJade4Eva coming soon ??????
