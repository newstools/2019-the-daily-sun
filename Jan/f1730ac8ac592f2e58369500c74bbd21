2019 is set to be a Supra new year as Toyota finally lifts
the covers off the new Supra today. Toyota has been for the longest given us glimpses of its
resurrected sports car. We've seen prototypes, heard them tearing up
racetracks. But today the Japanese automaker will reveal the final product
at the Detroit Auto Show. Thanks to the internet we have a good idea of what the
Japanese version of the BMW Z4 will look like. The car was leaked over the
weekend after Toyota Mexico tweeted a video of the Supra. They later removed but the internet had already screen
grabbed the video. We have to give it to Toyota, the car looks nothing like the
Z4 which is shares engines and almost everything underneath with. The Japanese
Z4 is a hardtop, unlike the German version. It features a bubble roof design that accentuates the
sporting nature of the Supra. Inside though you can see the German influence. A lot of the
switchgear if lifted off the Z4 which is not necessarily a bad thing. Underneath the car shares its drivetrain with the BMW ZA. Underneath the long bonnet, we expect to find a tweaked
version of BMW's B58 engine. No word on power outputs but in the Z4 M40i it
produces 250kW and 500Nm of torque. That torque is available from just 1600rpm. Power is sent through the rear wheels via an 8-speed
Steptronic automatic transmission.
