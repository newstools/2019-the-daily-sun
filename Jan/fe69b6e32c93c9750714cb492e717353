COPS need help to solve rape cases and have offered a R50 000 reward. The rapes occurred in Protea Glen and Braamfischerville in Soweto. Protea Glen police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng told Daily Sun that the man who goes around raping women had different tricks. “He sometimes pretends to be an agent helping people with jobs. Desperate women seeking jobs then become victims,” he said. He said other times, the man tried to persuade women into a relationship. “He would be walking with the woman trying to pursue her and if they pass a field, he drags the woman there and rapes her.” Mashiteng said the man would then threaten the woman never to say a word or he would kill her. He said cops were looking for a Soweto man known as Thami, who they believe could assist them with their investigations. He is light in complexion and middle aged. “A reward of R50 000 will be offered to anyone who can provide information that can assist to solve these cases.” Mashiteng said anyone with information should contact investigating officer Sergeant Ernest Twala on 076 162 2368 or the provincial Serial Investigation Unit on 079 890 7472.
