PASTOR Timothy Omotoso is standing trial for charges including rape. But a group of Christians has decided to judge him according to the Bible. Members of Christians of South Africa said they will visit Omotoso in prison to allow him to explain. The group’s president, Derick Masoana, said: “Our national executive committee will then make a judgment whether or not Omotoso is guilty. We are not undermining the court of law but we are obligated by scripture to uphold Christianity.” Masoane said none of the evidence presented in the trial suggested Omotoso was a rapist. He said it appeared Omotoso had consensual sex with his alleged victims.
