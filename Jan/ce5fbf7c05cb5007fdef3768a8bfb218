ONE man’s rubbish is another man’s wealth. Madala Johnson Kaka has proved that money can be made from the bones people throw away. The 80-year-old from Motherwell in Port Elizabeth is a pensioner but he refused to depend on his social grant. The madala goes around his kasi collecting bones from shisa nyamas and butcheries. He said: “I noticed people were throwing away bones after eating meat. “I went to a company in Markman industrial area that deals with animal products, and they agreed to buy the bones from me. “I’m also assisting the municipality by cleaning up the area. “If bones are left scattered everywhere, they become a health hazard and attract stray dogs. “Children who pick them up are at risk of getting sick. “I make R2 000 to R2 500 a month, which helps buy electricity and other household items. I don’t want to sit around doing nothing as it isn’t good for my health.” The madala, who is originally from Makhanda and moved to Port Elizabeth six years ago, started his business in September and lives with his daughter and grandchild.
