TV and radio personality, Bridget Masinga has revealed rare insight into her love life. The very private personality, went down memory lane and told fans about the day she met the love of her life. She posted a picture of herself wearing the exact same outfit she wore when she went on that all-important first day. She admits that she didn’t make much of the date and in fact, was just there for the free meal. How relatable? “Wore this exact situation 3 years ago, on a 1st date with this Zulu guy and some friends. I opted not to wear a dress or anything that said, “We’re on a date”,” she said. “I figured this would say, I made an effort to look decent but don’t expect anything because I’m only here for the meal and maybe some good company,” she went on. But much to her surprise, the Kaya FM presenter was about to share the first meal with the love of her life. “#3yrs later, the outfit is still here and well so is My Love,” she ended the adorable post.
