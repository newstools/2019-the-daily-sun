FORMER
spin doctor Mzwanele Manyi has announced his new political home, the African
Transformation Movement (ATM). The
party was formed by disgruntled supporters of former president Jacob Zuma. Manyi
told the media at a briefing that he wants to apologise to all employees of
ANN7/AfroWorld View, whose children were kicked out of schools because of
Multichoice’s decision not to renew their contract. "If they had given us reasons it would
have been better, but they just decided to shut us down the channel and government
did nothing,” Manyi said.
