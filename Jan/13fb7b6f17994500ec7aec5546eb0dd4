THEY erected their own speed humps to stop cars from speeding and hurting their children. Now the children are safe, but residents of Nombula Street in Asanda Village in Strand, near Cape Town, have a new problem. Taxis have stopped using Nombula Street as they claim the humps damage their vehicles and thugs attack passengers who are dropped far from their houses. “The taxi used to drop me in front of my house but now they drop me far away. We have to walk in groups otherwise we get robbed,” said resident Lufefe Chayichayi (34). He said at first he supported the idea of the speed humps but not anymore as it might cost him his life. Nosakhele Mbonjeni said they wanted a reaction from the municipality. “We thought they would put down proper speed humps. It is too late to remove these now.” Lwandle Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association chairman Thandisile Nkomo said they would not use the road even if the speed humps were legal. “Nombula Street people have themselves to blame.” Felicity Purchase, Cape Town City’s MMC for transport, said the humps will be installed as soon as funding is available.
