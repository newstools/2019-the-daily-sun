 Television and radio personality, Lerato Kganyago has reflected on some of her darkest moments in the entertainment biz. The Project Runway SA host told Mo Flava and Masechaba Ndlovu on their Metro FM Afternoon Drive show that her darkest day was the one and only day she host a radio show with the queen, Bonang Matheba. She started off by saying that she has had a lot of ups and downs in entertainment but she is happy for it. "I've had a beautiful journey. [I take the] hardships and I embrace them whole heartedly because that is when God is building your character and define you,” she said. LKG also spoke about being bullied by trolls on social media and not being liked by other girls in the industry. Masechaba then asked her what her darkest days in the biz has been. If you recall that in 2017, Metro FM announced LKG as a surprise co-host for Bonang’s show, The Front Row, a move that left even Queen B* herself stunned as she allegedly only found out an hour before going on air. The two IT girls hosted one show and by the end of it, B* had already tendered her resignation to the SABC. She never did another radio show and fans blamed LKG for the whole mess. She has now opened up about how hard it was for her to receive all the blame. Without going into too much detail, LKG told Mo and Masechaba that it truly was her darkest day. “I think my darkest moment and I'm not trying to blame anyone, but it was the day that I actually did the show with Bonang. I got blamed for her leaving the show,” she said. “I cried, I won’t lie. I wept for so many days,” she continued. When asked how the one show was, Lerato described it as “tense”. “It was very tense. And I thought, 'you know what another teething phase, we'll be okay by tomorrow'. But, it was just awkward, man,” she said. She ended things off on a cordial note. "I have so much respect for her, she has her own reasons why she left."
