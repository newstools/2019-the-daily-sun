AS THE race for promotion to the Absa Premiership reaches boiling point, bottom clubs are also battling it out to avoid relegation from the National First Division. Jomo Cosmos, whom many thought will be title contenders this season after failing to return to the top flight via promotion relegation play-offs last season, have now found themselves in the mix. Cosmos are going to tomorrow’s (3.30pm) fixture against TS Sporting at Kabokweni Stadium sitting in 12th position, with 20 points after 17 league matches. They are just five points above Witbank Spurs, who are rooted at the bottom of the log with 15 points. Ubuntu Cape Town and Real Kings are also in danger as they are among the bottom teams. At the end of the season, two teams that finishes in 15th and 16th position will be relegated to the unfashionable ABC Motsepe League. Tomorrow, Spurs will be hoping for maximum points when they host Simo Dladla’s Kings in the relegation battle at Puma Stadium at the same time. Spurs coach Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba believes he will save the Mpumalanga outfit from getting relegated. Mashaba said: “I’m facing a hell of a task to save the club. We do have capable players who can change the situation. If we can manage to win five games, that would be a giant step. We will then be able to breath.” At the top, teams are breathing on each other’s neck. Stellenbosch are still leading the race with 34 points, followed by Ajax Cape Town with 30 points. On Sunday, the two teams will lock horns in a top of the table clash at Idas Valley Sports Ground. Stellies will be hoping to dust themselves after they were shocked 2-0 by Richards Bay last weekend, while Ajax are expected to continue with their impressive displays under new coach Andries Ulderink, who has yet to lose a match since replaced Muhsin Ertugral in November.
