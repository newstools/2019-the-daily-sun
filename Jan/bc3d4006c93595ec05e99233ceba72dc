Seven teachers at Eldorado Park Secondary are yet to report for duty a week after schools re-opened. The teachers have not been to work since September 2017 after allegations of racism and intimidation. The school’s governing body’s Victor Molahloe said they wanted the department of education to send the teachers to other schools. Victor said the teachers had accused the principal of racism and drawing a knife on them. “The department investigated the allegations and the principal was found not guilty,” said Victor. Parent Alana Jacobs said: “Those teachers disrupted the school. “Children were fighting, teaching didn’t go on and we had a backlog of school work.” She also denied there was racism as there was one coloured teacher among the seven teachers. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: “The department has had several meetings with all the stakeholders.” He urged parents, the principal and SGB to ensure the teachers are welcomed back and that their work conditions are favourable.
