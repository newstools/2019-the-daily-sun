THEMBA Dlamini is pleading with the woman he last had sex with to come back and unlock his 4-5. The 37-year-old from Actonville, Ekurhuleni, said the last time he had sex was two years ago. “It was the best I’ve ever had, but it was also my last time,” said Themba. “I know it’s crazy but whatever that woman did to me is powerful.” Themba said at first he thought it was a medical problem but doctors told him there was nothing wrong with his 4-5. “They just told me to eat healthily. “I went to a sangoma and he told me it would be difficult to reverse the curse and I needed to find that woman,” Themba told Daily Sun. Themba said his 4-5 won’t work. “I have lost my manhood. No woman will agree to be in a relationship without having sex. My life has come to a standstill.” Themba described the woman as the best girlfriend he ever had, but their relationship only lasted three months. “There was no argument. She just left,” he said. “I hope she comes back to unlock my 4-5 because I need to get my life back.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi told the People’s Paper that the woman had cursed Themba but said he would try to help him. “I’ve dealt with similar cases before and this one is no different. The woman wanted to be the only person Themba ever thought about,” Joseph said. “The best alternative would be to find that woman so she can reverse the curse.”
