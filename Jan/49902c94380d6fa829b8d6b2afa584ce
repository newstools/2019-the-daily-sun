WHILE patients blame nurses for the delay in attending to them, nurses say their hands are tied. Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital nurses in Umlazi south of Durban said their load is too heavy. They said they are short-staffed as there are too many patients and it is beyond their control. A nurse said patients come from as far at Mbumbulu, Adams, Folweni and even Mfume. “We thought the department would have resolved the situation by now, but it has not. Patients are complaining they don’t get medical attention on time.” Another nurse said in April health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo announced a hospital would be built in Mbumbulu to reduce Prince Mshiyeni’s work load. “But we haven’t heard about any developments. We were looking forward to that hospital. She said a hospital in Mbumbulu would help those who travel far to Prince Mshiyeni. “We understand it won’t be built overnight but need to know how far the planning is. Patients don’t get the help they need.” Patient Mthokozisi Mncube (48) from Umlazi said the Prince Mshiyeni situation is terrible. “You have to prepare yourself, as you will be there the whole day.” KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The department knows of the pressure at facilities with large catchment areas. There are plans to relieve the pressure and the department recently employed 300 nurses through its mass recruitment drive.” She said 150 enrolled nurses and 150 enrolled nursing assistants will be integrated into the existing teams of healthcare professionals. “All other vacancies will also be filled in good time,” she said.
