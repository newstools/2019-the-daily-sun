KZN DA leader and premier candidate Zwakele Mncwango is recovering in hospital after being involved in a car accident. At the time of the crash on the M19 highway on Sunday, Mncwango was on his way to the party’s provincial head office in Springfield, Durban. He was due to visit IEC voter registration centres in eThekwini to check on progress. His double-cab bakkie veered off the road while he was on his way, leaving him injured. He wrote on his Facebook page: “Only God will decide about my life. I don’t know how I survived this accident but it was through God. I don’t even want to see pictures of my car. My seatbelt saved me and that is all I remember.” DA spokeswoman Philile Sefasta said: “Mncwango didn’t suffer serious injuries. He sustained an injury above the mouth but went for surgery and he is better now.”
