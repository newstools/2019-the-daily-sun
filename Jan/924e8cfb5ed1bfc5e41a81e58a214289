SHOW business can be brutal and downright cold, because of egos and the need to feel important. In fact, friendships are hard to come by in the entertainment industry, so when one finds it, they need to hold on it for dear life, because it’s a rare commodity. This is exactly why 7de Laan actress Nobuhle Mahlasela is showing appreciation to one of her close friends in the business. In an emotionally charged Instagram post, the actress, who plays Aggie in the SABC2 soapie, thanked Salamina Mosese for always being there for her and believing in her. “#WCW in fact #WCE Dear Salamina Mosese Thank you for always being there for me for always cheering me on and believing in me even when I gave up on myself, for your continuous prayers and love. You are a beautiful soul and I’m blessed that I can call on you anytime and you’ll be there to listen - I’m actually crying as I type this because you know me I’m a cry baby. Thank you for the time spent together yesterday - you reminded me that I am strong and I am brave. I love you Sal,” she wrote. #WCW in fact #WCE Dear @salaminamosese Thank you for always being there for me for always cheering me on and believing in me even when I gave up on myself, for your continuous prayers and love ??????.
