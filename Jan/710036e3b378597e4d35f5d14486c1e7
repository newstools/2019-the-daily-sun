WHEN the man of tradition bought a bottle of Jameson whiskey, he told everyone in his household he would be the one to open it. But his fiancee, Palesa Moloi (27), could not resist the booze when she saw it inside the cupboard, and took a sip. Today she is dead after her 35-year-old lover allegedly stabbed her several times for not obeying him! The man from Tswelopele near Midrand in Joburg was bust for murder on Tuesday. Captain Bernard Matimulane said when cops arrived at the couple’s rented room, they found the drunken suspect staring at Palesa’s body. “When police interrogated him, he told them he killed the woman because she opened his bottle of whiskey and drank some while he was not around,” he said. “He told the cops only he, as the head of the household, was entitled to open the liquor. “He claimed it was his culture.” The suspect was charged with murder and is expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Thursday. Landlord Siyabonga Vuma said he was hurt by what had happened in his yard. Geelbooi Moloi said he could not believe it when he received a call on New Year’s Day to let him know his daughter was murdered. Acting Ivory Park station commander Colonel Baba Mpotoane was shocked by the incident. “We are saddened by women being killed by the people who are supposed to love and protect them.”
