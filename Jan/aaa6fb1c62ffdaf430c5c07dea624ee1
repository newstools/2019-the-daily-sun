“MY life is in limbo. Whenever I go to prophets for help, they say the problem is the surname I’m using. “My father is the only person who can take me out of this problem.” This is Boitumelo Lekome’s plea to SunReaders –help me trace my dad. Boitumelo, who lives in Southdale in Joburg, is originally from Klerksdorp in North West. She has sleepless nights thinking about her absent dad. The 36-year-old mum of two boys and a girl is looking for her father, Johannes Mogale (61). She last saw him in 1996 when she visited his home in Mahikeng. In 1999 Boitumelo returned to Mahikeng to check on him and was told by her stepmum Johannes had found a new job in the Eastern Cape. “We’ve not heard from him. He never called to say he arrived in the Eastern Cape.” Boitumelo told Daily Sun she was worried her kids won’t know their granddad, whom she believes is alive. “He was a good dad to me, even though he never stayed with me. Whenever I visited him, he’d buy me clothes, give me pocket money, and take me to Mega City.” She uses her stepdad’s surname. “My stepdad raised me well, but it’s time I use my biological father’s surname.” She pleaded with SunReaders who have information about her dad to come forward.
