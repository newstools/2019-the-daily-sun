Maritzburg United have parted ways with Coach Muhsin Ertugral, the club have confirmed. Ertugral has resigned from his position just five games into his tenure. The Turkish tactician has not succeeded in changing the Team of Choice’s fortunes since he replaced Fadlu Davids towards the end of last year. His departure comes less than 24 hours after Maritzburg were dumped out of the Nedbank Cup by Shakes Mashaba’s Witbank Spurs on penalties. The KwaZulu Natal based team are winless in the league since Ertugral took over and are currently rooted  at the bottom of the table. They have only amassed 11 points in their 18 games so far and barring a near miraculous comeback, they look set to face the drop. "The coach admitted that he was concerned himself and felt he had done everything as best he could to turn things around, but the results did not come. It was then decided that we both shake hands and, by mutual agreement, go our separate ways," said club chairman Farook Kadodia in a statement released by the club. "Normally a new coach brings a new energy into a club and we had high hopes that this will be the case when we appointed Muhsin Ertugral. “But unfortunately after 5 games this was not forthcoming. The club had to look at its survival and its future, so it was a ultimately a results based decision," he added. Ertugral' successor will be announced by the club in due time with former Chippa United and SuperSport United coach Eric Tinkler reportedly the front-runner.
