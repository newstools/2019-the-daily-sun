A MADALA has been caught with R2,5 million in cash! But the cash is fake and the madala claims the notes don’t belong to him. The 65-year-old was found with the fong kong money at his house in Emdeni, Soweto and a photocopy machine was also confiscated. When questioned, he said the fake money belonged to someone else. The bust happened on Tuesday. Naledi cops received a tip-off from residents about a factory that made money in their kasi. The police raided the house and found photographic equipment and the huge pile of fake folding money. Moroka cop spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza told Daily Sun the madala was arrested and will appear in Protea Magistrates Court today to face fraud charges. He said the police want to warn street vendors to be careful when someone pays with R100 or R200 bank notes. “Vendors don’t have machines to check whether the bank notes are fake or real, so they need to be careful,” he said. Khoza praised Emdeni residents for coming forward with the information. “We must remember the police can only be successful if the community works hand-in-hand with them,” Khoza said.
