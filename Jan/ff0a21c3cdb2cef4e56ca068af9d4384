 Schoemansdal police outside Malelane, Mpumalanga, have launched a manhunt for a group of suspects who bombed a cash safe at the local filling station on Tuesday morning. They fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the robbery happened at about 1:45am when two men knocked on the door of the filling station and demanded the keys but were told they were not available. “Then about 10 or 11 men started shooting at the door in an attempt to open it,” said Hlathi. “Somehow the suspects managed to force open the burglar bars on the cashier’s window and got into the safe room.” He said that once the suspects were in that room, they blasted open the safe and fled with the cash. “Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects.” Hlathi said police are appealing to anyone with information that may lead to tracing the thugs or can help in the investigation to contact Detective Constable Vusi Bhiya on 013 781 3322 or the SAPS Crime Stop number at 08600 10111.
