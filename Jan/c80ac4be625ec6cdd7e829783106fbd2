THEY are forced to cook in full view of residents! This is because their house does not have kitchen walls. Every day, frustrated Johanna Baloyi (56) has to take the pots, dishes, her stove and table outside into what used to be their kitchen. Her kitchen has been without walls since a heavy storm brought them down in February 2017. “It’s a daily struggle we have to face. In the morning and for the rest of the day, we use this open space as a kitchen and have to cook in full view of residents. At night, we have the job of moving everything back into the house and it gets very cramped,” said Johanna. She is now asking SunLanders to lend a helping hand. “I live with my brother and sister and my sister’s three children, but none of us is working. We have been mocked by community members who pretended to care, yet made us a laughing stock. “We have no hope we will get help as we have been in this situation for the past two years,” she said. “It’s been raining lately, which has put a lot of strain on us because all the water comes into the house. Winter is approaching and we are forced to wake up early and set up our kitchen outside in the cold.” Johanna said she had arthritis and dreaded waking up on cold winter days to cook outside or simply get hot water for a cup of tea. “We just need a Good Samaritan to help us. We also thank the people who have been donating bricks in bits and pieces. Maybe one day they will amount to what we need.”
