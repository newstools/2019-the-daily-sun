IT was nothing short of chaos as the New Year’s heavy rain and thunderstorms lashed many parts of the country, with rivers and streams overflowing their banks. Many motorists found themselves stuck in the water, and even small trees were seen floating down roads! Five people had a lucky escape yesterday after they drove off a bridge on Witkoppen Road in Fourways, Joburg, and ended upside down in a stream. ER24 spokesman Ross Campbell said: “The three men and two women managed to free themselves from the half-submerged car. They sustained only minor injuries.” Co-operative Governance Minister Zweli Mkhize has called on government departments, NGOs and the private sector to lend a hand and manage disaster risks better. Mkhize said more than 400 families, mostly in the Eastern Cape, were left homeless. South African Weather Service spokeswoman Hannelee Doubell said: “Gauteng will experience rains until Sunday.” In the Vaal, officials from the Emfuleni and Sedibeng disaster management departments visited devastated areas yesterday. Emfuleni spokesman Stanley Gaba told Daily Sun floods damaged roads in areas and destroyed walls. “Over 70 houses were badly damaged in the zone 6 and Residensia areas,” he said. He said low-lying areas including zones 3 and 13 were badly flooded. “Officials remain at the scene. No deaths have been reported,” he said. “More rain is expected in Emfuleni and residents are advised to be careful on the roads.” Community leader Vusi Morris said there have been drainage problems since 2003. “We protested to get it sorted out, but they put in smaller pipes. They promised to add more pipes but never did.”
