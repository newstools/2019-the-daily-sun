FOUR airport follow home suspects have been arrested in Hillbrow. The break through comes after investigations into incidents
of people being followed from OR Tambo International Airport (ORTIA) and being
robbed of their belongings. “During a joint intelligence-driven operation the members of
the National Investigation Unit (NINU) with the assistance of Parkview
detectives followed up on information about a suspect who was allegedly involved
in an airport following case,” police spokesperson Liutanant Colonel KD Mogale Said. According to Mogale this led to the arrest of four suspects
aged between 25 and 45 at various residences in the area of Hillbrow. The cops found a 38 special revolver, five rounds of
ammunition as well as suspected stolen property including a passport,
suitcases, clothing and a laptop. “The team is not ruling out the possibility of these
suspects being involved in other such cases,” Mogale said. Mogale said further investigations are being conducted in
this regard. The four suspects will be appearing in the Johannesburg
Magisrates' Court on Monday, facing charges of armed robbery and theft.
