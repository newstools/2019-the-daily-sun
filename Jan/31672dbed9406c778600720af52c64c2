WHAT started as a chilled Sunday soul session ended with blood and death. Customers at a pub in Soshanguve, Tshwane, were robbed on Sunday by a group of between five and eight gunmen. The thugs left two men dead and more than 10 people wounded. A witness said everyone was having a good time when they suddenly heard gunshots at the door. He said before they realised what was happening, a group of men with guns started shooting randomly from all corners of the pub. “We all took cover, but unfortunately some people were shot before they could hide.” The witness said the men then stopped shooting and demanded money and cellphones. “They took our belongings and as they were about to leave, they shot the bartender in the head and another customer twice in the chest,” said the witness. “We watched the guard bleed to death before help could come.” Captain Mathews Nkoadi of the Soshanguve police said they were told five armed men robbed patrons and fatally shot a security guard and customer. He said an undisclosed amount of money was taken and police found more than 30 cartridges at the scene.
