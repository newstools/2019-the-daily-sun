THE Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has officially
launched the 2019 National and Provincial Elections. The IEC launched the campaign at Gallagher Convention Centre
encouraging South Africa’s youth to register and vote. According to the commission, despite representing over 50
percent of the population, South Africans aged under 30 years old have the
lowest levels of voter registration. Electoral Commission Chairperson Glen Mashinini, said the
young people of Mzansi comprise an increasingly powerful and crucial segment of
our economy. The campaign features young South Africans from all walks of
life expressing their reasons for the importance of voting in the upcoming
elections under a newly-created word: Xsê “We zoned in on a phrase that is uniquely South African.
It’s cool and can be used easily by anyone across the culture lines. It’s a
call to action phrase, one that prompts you to take notice and take action,” Chief
Electoral Officer Sy Mamabolo said. “Xsê is a multi-culturally understood colloquial South
African term that can be used in many situations, especially when one wants to
be heard. Elections allow for an individual’s voice to be heard hence
we made it for the individual to own. Moreover, it’s a clever play on the ‘X’
that voters put on the ballot paper and which has featured in previous election
campaigns. “We hope Xsê becomes part of the lexicon of South African
youth during this these elections,” Mamabolo said. The focus of the campaign is to promote registration during
the upcoming final voter registration weekend being held on 26 – 27 January
2019, when the country’s 22 927 voting stations will open from 08h00 to 17h00 -
to allow new voters to register and existing voters to update and to check their
registration details. A key aspect of the campaign will also be to encourage
already registered voters to also use the opportunity of the registration
weekend or the online facility to check and update their address details.
