A MAN accused of killing a cop and her husband has abandoned bail as he fears for his life. The 31-year-old appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Tuesday. Addressing the court, magistrate Fortune Mhlaba said the accused faced seven charges including house robbery, house breaking, possession of an unlicensed firearm and murder. The court was packed with residents, led by CPF chairman Million Shishamba. They said they were there to support the families of the murdered cop and her husband. The accused was arrested by the Hawks organised crime investigation unit and Amaberete in Mhluzi, Middleburg, last Saturday. He and his accomplices allegedly shot Jabulani Khoza (40) and his wife Sergeant Thembekile Ndlovu (42) at their home in Agincourt at the beginning of last month. One suspect was killed on the scene while two managed to escape in Ndlovu’s car, which was later found abandoned in Bushbuckridge. The couple’s families said they wanted the accused to rot in jail.  The matter was postponed to the 26 February for investigation.
