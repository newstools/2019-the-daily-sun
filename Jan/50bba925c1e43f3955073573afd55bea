CALLS to scrap the e-toll system appear to have fallen on
deaf ears. It has emerged that e-toll is not going anywhere, anytime
soon. The proposal to fund e-tolls is said to include increased
licensed disk fees, card renewals fees and increased fines. This was revealed by Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga during a
press briefing. The DA shadow minister, Manny de Freitas said Electronic
Toll Collection Agency has confirmed that the e-toll contract has been extended
to December. The party said the contract between the collection agency
and Sanral was signed in April 2017. De Freitas said this contradicts the written reply by Transport
Minister Blade Nzimande in September 2016 that the contract will end in
December last year. “The terms of the contract indicate that Sanral has the
option to renew the e-toll contract until 2021,” said Msimanga. The renewal of the contact took place while unions,
organisations, opposition parties as well as some members of the ANC were
demonstrating against the system. In November, the Gauteng ANC deputy chairman and MEC for
education Panyaza Lesufi reportedly said in six months the e-toll funding model
will come to an end. Meawhile Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, in his maiden
mid-term budget speech, called on Gauteng motorists to pay their outstanding
bills. It is understood that about 25% of motorists are paying their e-toll
accounts. Msimanga accused the ANC of deliberately lying to Gauteng
residents. “The e-toll contract was renewed without public knowledge or
any public consultation,” he said. “The ANC has had plenty of opportunities to set the record
straight but have instead kept quiet and continued to keep South Africans in
the dark about the contract.”
