HE consistently proves to be a force to be
reckoned with in the hip-hop scene. Without any fail, it seems like every album
rapper Cassper Nyovest releases reach platinum. The award-winning rapper did something that
no hip-hop artist has ever done before; he released a Kwaito album in November,
and it turned to be one of the wisest things he has ever done according to him.
One of the singles from the album Gets Getsa has been getting a great
reception, and he said he has been performing the song from the album. He posted on social media that his Kwaito
album titled Sweet and Short is currently on double platinum and will go double
platinum in few months. He wrote: “I dropped a full Kwaito project
and it’s platinum and we gonna go double platinum in a few months. I been
performing the album and man it’s the wisest thing I’ve ever done. The hood is
still the hood. The love what they love. That authentic ghetto sh*t we started
with.”
