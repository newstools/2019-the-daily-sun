FOLLOWING a wasted year for pupils of Ramokokastad Village, the North West department of education has convinced angry residents to allow pupils to go back to school on Monday. This is after protests in the village last year saw pupils from all grades except grade 12 stay at home and miss their final exams. The department has since decided to evaluate pupils by using their first-term and second- term marks. It took the matric pupils from the four high schools to a secret camp so they could study for exams. Kwena Tlase Secondary obtained an 86,21% pass rate, Ramoroko Secondary 50%, Gautime Secondary 30% and Mphela Secondary 40%. A recovery plan has been put in place for pupils who were progressed to the next grade to catch up on the work they missed in terms three and four last year. The plan includes pupils attending afternoon and Saturday classes and dedicated camps for Grade 9 and 12 classes during the holidays. The province’s superintendent-general Stephinah Semaswe said the department would support pupils and teachers during the intervention period. “I want to assure the community that the future of the pupils will be directed towards the correct path,” she said. She requested that parents collect their reports for their children from grade R to grade 7 on Wednesday, and grade 8 to grade 12 on Friday. Semaswe highlighted that all pupils of the village will be provided with stationery and textbooks on the day they come back to school so they can start with their schoolwork immediately.
