POLICE received a tip-off about illegal mining going on at the squatter camp. When they arrived to confiscate equipment, including five sieving machines, all hell broke loose. The zama zamas attacked the cops, who had to run for their lives and left their cars behind. After the incident on Wednesday, the angry zama zamas at Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni, stripped the two cop cars of their wheels, radios and batteries. The vehicles had to be towed away. But the cops returned with back-up and five illegal miners were arrested. They are facing charges of malicious damage to property, possession of stolen goods and public violence. The SunTeam tried to speak to the zama zamas, but they refused. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said more than 10 cops were attacked and the suspects will appear in court soon. “Some cops sustained minor injuries as they were fleeing the scene. “We are appealing to residents to help us recover the stolen police property,” said Ramphora. Anyone with information should call Springs Police Station on 011 365 5719/20.
