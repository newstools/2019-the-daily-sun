LADIES, there’s a new mobile poke available for those in need of sexual fulfilment. Tebogo Mabuza (35) from Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, said no woman should use sex toys out of desperation. “I’ve spent most of my time with women around my neighbourhood and realised they’ve been suffering sexually,” said Tebogo. “Most women have come out of bad relationships and want nothing to do with new ones. “Others are single and struggling to find a good relationship.” Tebogo said his female friends openly spoke about how they were forced to settle for sex toys. “It breaks my heart. I’m capable of meeting their sexual needs and I love sex. “I’ve been afraid of how my family will view me and I’ve not told them about this because they’d see this as prostitution or sex addiction. “But I’ve chosen to go ahead with this journey until I’m comfortable enough to tell them the truth.” Tebogo, who works as a forklift operator, said he gave up on finding true love after a bad break-up. But his services will not be motivated by money. “I’ll be a phone call away for any woman in need. I’m prepared to please them. “Issues involving money will be dealt with later because it’s not a priority.” Tebogo’s friend Thabang Maputla (28) said he supported him all the way. “He constantly talks about it. He’s been wanting to do this for a while. “I’m here for him as a friend. I can see he’s determined.”
