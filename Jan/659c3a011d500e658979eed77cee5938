SMALL injuries that we take for granted, resulting from small house chores, can get worse if not treated properly. Common ailments are lower back injuries caused by incorrect lifting techniques at home or work. This includes moving furniture, weight training at the gym and lifting heavy objects. Safe lifting Avoid lifting objects that are very heavy without help. Keep heavy objects close to your body. Avoid lifting stuff off the floor and use your knees and hips to bend â€“ NOT your back. Lifting and bending, combined with twisting of the lower back, is a recipe for injury. Other common injuries include tripping and falling which may lead to sprained joints and strained muscles. The most common soft tissues that can be injured include muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Remember RICE When an acute injury like this occurs, use the RICE method of treatment. RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. The method Rest: Take a break from the activity that caused the injury. Your doctor may recommend that you use crutches to avoid putting weight on your leg. Ice: Use cold packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do not apply ice directly to the skin. Compression: To prevent additional swelling and blood loss, wrap and wear an elastic compression bandage. Elevation: To reduce swelling, raise the injury slightly higher than your heart when resting.
