RESIDENTS of Maboloka went on the rampage on Monday morning. They blocked roads with tyres, stones and branches and allegedly burned four buses. The angry residents of the village near Brits called for the disbandment of the ANC’s North West task team. The team was appointed to manage the party’s affairs after the PEC, previously chaired by former premier Supra Mahumapelo, was dissolved. Protesters said they wanted proper roads, RDP houses and more jobs. A resident said: “Many people are sitting at home as they don’t have jobs while unqualified people get hired. We want to be heard.” Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said: “We are investigating four cases of malicious damage to property that were opened, but no arrests have been made.” Schools and malls were closed down. One person said: “This is not how to act. We can’t be damaging the things we are going to need in the future. Buses that were burned transport us to and from work.”
