ANGRY nurses have threatened not to vote for the ANC if the KZN Health Department does not meet their demands. The nurses, who belong to the Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa, marched to the department’s offices on Friday. The nurses demanded that the department fill vacant posts, saying most healthcare staff at hospitals were overworked. They chanted slogans of disapproval against Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo, who they blamed for staff shortages. “Our families sold livestock so we could train at institutions of higher learning. Now we’re qualified without jobs. This is unfair,” said one marcher. Union leader Bheki Gumbi said the department was about to collapse as there were not enough nurses at many hospitals in KZN. “Employ more nurses to cover staff shortages. We are experiencing burnout and illness,” said Gumbi. The union said nurses should be treated like doctors. “The department takes doctors from universities, so they must do the same with nurses. “We request that the department stop this discrimination,” he said. According to the union, there were more than 15 000 unemployed nurses and 40 000 vacant posts in KZN. Provincial health official Bheki Nzimande accepted the memorandum and said he would deliver it to the MEC.
