DA leader Mmusi Maimane has requested a meeting with Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa. On Monday, Maimane threatened to approach the United Nations and the International Criminal Court over the political crisis in Zimbabwe. He went to the Zimbabwean Embassy in Tshwane yesterday to ask to be allowed to visit the country in the coming week. He said he wanted to meet Mnangagwa to ask him to restore democracy in the country. Recent protests over a fuel hike in Zimbabwe led to 12 people being reported dead and hundreds injured. Those who took part in the protests said soldiers were sent to their houses to beat them up, while some were arrested. “The disturbing reports of beatings, arrests and other threats to hard-won democratic freedoms in Zimbabwe compelled me to act,” said Maimane. He said his trip would also form part of a fact-finding mission on Zimbabwe.
