The Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) title is for Cape Town City and Bloemfontein Celtic to lose, heading into this weekend’s round of action. In what is expected to be a title decider, the joint leaders will lock horns at the Dr Molemela Stadium tomorrow (10am). The Citizens and Siwelele have both accumulated 26 points from their 12 games so far, and are only separated by goal difference. They have been two of the most consistent teams in this year’s edition of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) reserve league. However, the chasing pack of Polokwane City, SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits are ready to pounce should both teams slip up. Rise and Shine, who play unpredictable Kaizer Chiefs at Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday (12pm), are just a single point behind City and Celtic.  SuperSport and Wits are a further three points behind the joint leaders – in fourth and fifth place respectively. With only three games to go, Cape Town City captain Shane Roberts says they just need to hold their nerve and they will clinch their maiden title. “We need to turn up against Celtic. “This is a big game and a golden opportunity for us to go out on our own as leaders,” he said. “Maintaining consistency is important when you are fighting for the title.” Roberts has already appeared for the senior team in the PSL this season against Celtic, he bagged an assist as the Citizens ran out 3-2 winners. “I’m hoping I can inspire the team to another victory against them,” he added.
