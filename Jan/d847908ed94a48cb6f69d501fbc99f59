JOMO Cosmos followed in the footsteps of lower division teams that caused an upset when they booted out PSL outfit Baroka FC from the Nedbank Cup following a 1-0 win at Polokwane’s Peter Mokaba Stadium last night. Ezenkosi striker Inky Masuku scored the goal that broke the hearts of Baroka’s partisan crowd in the 29th minute following a terrific cross from Chibuike Ohizu. They joined Bloemfontein Celtic, Mbombela United, Kaizer Chiefs, Witbank Spurs, Cape Town City, Golden Arrows, Black Leopards, TS Galaxy, Richards Bay, Chippa United, Highlands Park, Cape Umoya United, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Bidvest Wits in the last 16 draw scheduled for tomorrow in Joburg. Baroka were hoping to increase their chances of winning their second trophy this season having lifted the Telkom Knockout in December last year at the expense of Orlando Pirates on penalties in the final. However, Wedson Nyirenda’s charges and Cosmos had something in common as they both had one eye on Ke Yona while fully focused on avoiding relegation. Baroka are fourth bottom in the Absa Premiership table on 16 points and Ezenkosi occupy 12th spot in the National First Division with 20 points. Bakgaga will face fellow relegation candidates Chippa United in a league clash at the same venue on Sunday (3.30pm), while Cosmos host Mbombela United in an NFD match at Makhulong Stadium at the same time. Nyirenda made four changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Pirates away in their last league game as he preferred Bonginkosi Makume , Tshidiso Patjie, Mduduzi Mdantsane and veteran Letladi Madubanya ahead of Vusi Sibiya Thato Madigoe, Goodman Mosele and Matome Mabeba. Cosmos owner coach Jomo Sono made five changes to the side that lost 2-0 to TS Sporting in their last league game a week ago as he gave youngster Lehlogonolo Kekana his debut.
