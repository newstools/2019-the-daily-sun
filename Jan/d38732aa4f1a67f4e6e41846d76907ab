MOSHE Moloi claims his future was destroyed by cops who arrested him after he reported a kidnapping. The 22-year-old from Bohlokong in Bethlehem, Free State, said he couldn’t write his matric exams as he was behind bars. Moshe said he was arrested in November after he witnessed his friend being kidnapped by people in an unknown vehicle. He said instead of going after the thugs, cops handcuffed him and told him he was a suspect in a house robbery case. Moshe was acquitted on Friday as there was no evidence linking him to the house robbery, but he now has to repeat matric. “I spent six weeks in prison while I should have been writing exams. I wanted to study education, but my dreams have been put on hold. “Before my ordeal, I was walking to a tuckshop where I saw my friend being taken by two men in a black car. He pleaded with me to get help as the car drove off. “I immediately went to the cop shop to report it, but I was told to wait. All of a sudden, three officers told me they had been looking for me for a long time,” he said. He said his kidnapped friend had since been found. NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping confirmed Moshe was in custody. “He was acquitted because there was insufficient evidence in the case.”
