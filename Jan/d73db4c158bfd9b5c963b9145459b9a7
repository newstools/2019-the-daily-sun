SONIA Burger (53) was lying in bed on 7 January at about 9.30pm when she heard gunshots. Her daughter called her and Sonia looked out the window. When she looked down at the parking area of her flat in Westbury, Joburg, her worst fears became a reality. She ran outside and found her son Rowall (30) lying in a pool of blood. “He was calling my name. I asked him who did this and he named his killer,” she said. A day after Rowall was killed, the man he named as the shooter was arrested. Rowall was laid to rest on Saturday. Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the community last year and promised to clean up the area, but residents said drugs and guns were still a problem. The motive for the shooting is unclear, but Sonia said Rowall had nothing to do with drugs. “There are still guns and drugs in our community, and when we protest against it we’re locked up. We can’t continue to bury our children.” Police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubele said a case of murder was being investigated. Four suspects were arrested in connection with the killing of Heather Peterson, who died when she was caught in the crossfire during a gang shoot-out last year. Her death sparked violent protests across Westbury
