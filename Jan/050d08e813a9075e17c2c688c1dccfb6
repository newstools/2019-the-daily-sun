WHILE Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba is excited about developments in 84 of the inner city buildings, residents in those buildings fear they won’t have a roof over their heads. Nokuthula Mbatha (56) from Vannin Court, one of the three buildings Mashaba visited yesterday, told Daily Sun she did not trust that they would be given places to stay once they are moved from these buildings. “I have children and grandchildren. Where will we go if they move us?” she said. Nokuthula said Mashaba was not the first government official to visit their building, but there was still no change. Mashaba said: “When I told people I had a dream to change Jozi buildings into proper low-cost homes for people, they thought I was bluffing. “One of my biggest dreams is coming true.”
