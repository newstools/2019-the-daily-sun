FRIENDS were in court yesterday to support Pitch Black Afro during his first appearance. The Matofotofo singer was in the Joburg Magistrates Court on charges of murdering his wife Catherine Modisane and defeating the ends of justice. Friends of Pitch Black Afro, whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo, said they never expected anything like this to happen. One friend said: “I never knew him to be violent. But he was very short-tempered and quick to react with aggression in situations that upset him.” Another friend of the couple said he was with Pitch Black Afro and Catherine, known as Trisha to her friends, two weeks before she was killed. “I still don’t believe these allegations because those two were deeply in love. They could not live without each other. The last time I saw them, they were happy and we were all having fun.” He said even though his friend had a short temper, he didn’t believe he would do anything to harm his wife. The musician allegedly killed Trisha on the morning of 31 December at a bed and breakfast in Bellevue, Joburg. Aasked whether he would be hiring his own lawyer, the rapper said: “I would like the state to provide a representative as I don’t have money for legal fees.” The case was postponed to Tuesday to give him time to find a legal representative and for the state to trace his official address. Trisha’s funeral will be held today at her home in Meadowlands zone 1, Soweto.
