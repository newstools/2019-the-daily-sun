PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng has said in a Facebook video he will stop the heavy rains that have wreaked havoc in Ekurhuleni! Motsoeneng said he was not against rain but against floods caused by thunderstorms. The video was taken on Wednesday night outside the Kasie FM building in Spruitview, Ekurhuleni. Walking in the rain, he prayed and commanded lightning to stop. “You’ll not bring floods in Ekurhuleni. You stop now!” he prayed. “Storms and floods are not from God. Ekurhuleni will not experience floods.” In the video, the rain appears to slow down and, according to Mboro, that is a sign God has listened. “It has stopped and will only rain peacefully. I thank God for listening to his prophet.” Mboro told Daily Sun that during his New Year’s Eve church service, the Holy Spirit had told him floods were coming to destroy Ekurhuleni. “I started to pray with the rest of the congregation,” he said. The spirit returned on Wednesday. “I was told if I don’t act now, it will get very bad,” he said. He warned that the disaster would try to attack and urged religious leaders and members of the community to join him in stopping the rain. Mboro said: “The year 2019 will be a year of disasters, political turmoil and economic meltdown. “But if we stand together in God’s word, it will not happen. “We will overcome these challenges and disasters.”
