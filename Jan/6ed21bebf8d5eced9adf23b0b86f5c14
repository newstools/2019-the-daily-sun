THE mother of the man who was shot dead in Delft, Cape Town wants the state to help bury him. Nomhle Madinga (48) told Daily Sun that her son was killed because he was a state witness in a crucial case. “When a detective asked my son to be a witness I asked if theywould protect him and they said they would but now he is gone.” Her son was supposed to go to court on Thursday to be a witness in a case. “He just came back from work and was cutting his hair when a young girl came in and asked him to go outside with her,” she said. “It was hardly five minutes later that I heard gun shots. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I went out and saw my son lying there lifeless.” Madinga said she was forced to sell her house in Nyanga because people were harassing her. “I left that place to hide here and I don’t know how they found us. We all know what happens to state witnesses and that is why I asked them in the first place.” Her son will be buried in Mount Fletcher, in the Eastern Cape. “I am hurt because I trusted them, not knowing that they wouldn’t keep their promise,” said Madinaga. Her son, Sizwe Madinga (28,) was shot in the body and in the forehead. Daily Sun published the story on 9 January: “Killers in jail”. Madinga not only wants the state to help bury her son but she also wants protection. “These people know where I live and I am afraid that they will come and kill me.” Lieteunant-Colonel Andre Traut said the family should contact Nyanga police management.
