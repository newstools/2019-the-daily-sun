MY SON is no punching bag. These were the words of an angry father who claims his 10-year-old son is being abused by his teachers. The 36-year-old father from Kroonstad, Free State, said a witness caught teachers beating him with their fists and banging him against classroom walls on Friday. The father, who is not being named to protect his son’s privacy, told Daily Sun: “My son dropped a bombshell when he told me it wasn’t the first time he was assaulted by teachers. “We got worried after a witness noticed my son was missing after classes ended. She went to his classroom and witnessed his teacher assaulting him. “The teacher couldn’t explain why she hit my son. I had to travel from my job in Joburg in order to deal with the matter. “The teacher was called to the principal’s office and told me she had no reason for beating my son. “I was upset and decided to take the matter to the police station. My son complained about back pain and told me his teacher had assaulted him.” He said his son was not a troublemaker and the teacher had been reported by parents before, but no disciplinary action was taken. Education spokesman Howard Ndaba said: “The matter was reported to the department and, at this stage, we are investigating.” Police spokeswoman Constable Kethabile Mofokeng confirmed that a case of common assault was opened. “The case was registered after a 10-year-old pupil was allegedly assaulted with an open hand by a teacher. “No arrests have been made yet and the investigation continues.”
