BOSASA got government contracts before they were even advertised! This is according to former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi, who was continuing with his testimony at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture sitting in Parktown, Joburg, yesterday. He said in 2005, the company got a contract to fence the prisons before officials or anybody knew about the contract. “I remember, it came as a shock to them. The tender didn’t follow normal process.” He said tendering was done through the public works department and because Bosasa was attracting negative publicity, they got the R487 million deal through Phezulu Fencing. He said after the contract was awarded, Bosasa got a maintenance contract which also didn’t go to tender. “Bosasa would control the operation. You could rape the country through that business for anything you wanted,” he said. He said Bosasa paid ex-correctional services commissioner Linda Mti and ex-chief financial officer Patrick Gillingham monthly bribes for information. He said Bosasa built houses for both of them, and Mti received R65 000 a month, which was later increased to R100 000. His two kids from his previous marriage had their school fees and holiday trips paid by Bosasa. Bosasa boss Gavin Watson liked Mti as he “always delivered on his promises”. A regional correctional services official he identified as Nxele and Popcru official he said was Sbu were paid R1 million a month, which was distributed to other officials.
