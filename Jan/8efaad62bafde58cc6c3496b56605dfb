EDUCATION stakeholders have praised the Class of 2018. The University of Johannesburg said it looked forward to welcoming matrics. “UJ congratulates all matriculants and looks forward to welcoming all those who have been accepted in various programmes of study in 2019,” it said. It reminded students that the application, admission and registration process is entirely online – no walk-ins and late applications will be accepted. The 2019 intake comprises about 10 000 first-year undergraduate students, making UJ home to nearly 50 000 students. Professor Brahm Fleisch, the Education Policy and Educational Change expert from the University of the Witwatersrand, said literature and numeracy still remain a big challenge. He said the real challenge is not the Grade 12s who have failed or are unable to go into university for various reasons. “The fundamental problem is that many children don’t acquire necessary skills at lower grades to enable them to read and write.” “This was particularly evident last year when the announcement of a 75,1% matric pass rate for 2017 followed the release of the devastating results of an international reading study that showed 78% of grade 4s in the country are illiterate.” “We remain committed to the delivery of quality basic education for all our learners. A well-equipped cohort of school-leavers is not only crucial for breaking the cycle of poverty, but also for a growing economy,” said DA spokeswoman on basic education Nomsa Marchesi.
