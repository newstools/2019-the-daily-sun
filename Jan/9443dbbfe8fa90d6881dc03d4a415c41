President Cyril Ramaphosa has instructed the Special
Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate the Life Healthcare Esidimeni contract
and 28 entities. The SIU will probe allegations of irregularities in
procurement by the Gauteng Department of Health, its employees or by contractors. Life Healthcare Esidimeni came under the spotlight in 2016
when 140 mental health patients died, when they were moved from Life Esidimeni
Healthcare to inadequately equipped, unsanctioned NGO facilities. According to the Health Ombudsman’s report, all 27 NGOs to
which the patients were transferred operated under invalid licences and all
patients who died at these facilities died under unlawful circumstances. The move was facilitated under the Gauteng Mental Health
Marathon Project (GMHMP), which has since been stopped. Ramaphosa’s authorisation enables the SIU to investigate
irregularities by officials or employees of Life Healthcare Esidimeni.
