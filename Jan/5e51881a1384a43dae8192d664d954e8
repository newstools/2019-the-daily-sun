THEY pretend to be asking for a lift, but are actually hijackers! Cops are warning motorists to be careful. Captain Johannes Ramphora said more than five motorists were attacked on the N12 just after the Etwatwa and Springs offramp. He said some of the bodies were recovered in the open field not far from the bridge. “Some were attacked and survived. We are warning motorists to be extra careful and not to give lifts to strangers. “Most hitchhikers pretend to be asking for a lift, but their mission is to hijack unsuspecting motorists,” said Ramphora. He said in one instance, a motorist stopped to pee and was attacked. Ramphora said another body was found next to the offramp last Sunday. “The man had stab wounds. He was wearing navy-blue trousers, navy socks and a short sleeved navy vest. He had a ring on his left ring finger. The body is in the government mortuary in Springs,” he said. On Tuesday night, a couple was grabbed by three suspects who took their car keys. The woman was raped and the man was tied up. Ramphora said the couple walked to Etwatwa Police Station to open a case. “The suspects made off with their car keys, wallet, two cellphones and their luggage but luckily left the car.” Anyone who has information is asked to contact Springs police on 011 365 5719/20.
