PHILEMON “Chippa” Masinga got a farewell befitting a warrior of football yesterday. The soccer legend, who died last week at the age of 49, was buried in Stilfontein, North West. Among the scores of mourners were icons such as Jomo Sono and Chippa’s teammates from the 1996 Bafana Bafana team that won the Africa Cup of Nations. Former minister Malusi Gigaba, deputy minister of co-operative governance and traditional affairs, Obed Bapela, and singer Rebecca Malope also attended. Sono described Chippa as a skinny, tall boy who was teased by his opponents. However, in his first professional game the 17-year-old Chippa scored a goal. Doctor Khumalo said Chippa was not only a teammate but also a friend. “He made me what I am in football. When I heard he had passed on, I didn’t understand it,” he said. Chippa’s wife Ntombi said he was the pillar of strength for her and their children. Chippa’s son Sfiso and Sono appealed for the football hall of fame to include him, which was acknowledged by Safa president Danny Jordaan. Jordaan also attended the service.
