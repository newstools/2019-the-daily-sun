The world’s greatest sprinter, Usain Bolt is headed back to our sunny shores. The decorated athlete has been billed to once again host the Sun Met alongside two of our most famous faces, Minnie Dlamini-Jones and Somizi Mhlongo. This after he was hired as GH Mumm’s (official sponsors of the Sun Met) Chief Entertainment Officer in 2018, officially making him the keeper of all things fun at the Sun Met. The Sun Met, dubbed “Africa’s richest race day” is due to take place on Saturday, 26 January at the Kenilworth Racecourse in Cape Town. The mother city will place host to Africa’s fashion authorities, celebrities and the wealthiest socialites our continent has to offer. The 2019 edition of the horse-racing event will be the second year in a row that Minnie and Usain will be working together. ICYMI: MINNIE HANGS OUT WITH USAIN BOLT And now with the edition of the flamboyant Somizi, things are bound to be over the top. Not straying too far from last year’s “African-inspired prints”, this year’s theme is “African Luxury: Precious Metals”. This means that we are in for a sparkly treat as our favourite stars will strut their stuff in golds, platinums, silvers and coppers. According to City Press, Somizi has been doing some last-minute fabric shopping this week at the Oriental Plaza in Joburg. Thus far, only Lady Zamar, DJ Maphorisa, Mafikizolo have been confirmed as the performers of the day. On yo marks. Ready. Go. A post shared by  Somizi (@somizi) on Jan 20, 2019 at 9:23pm PST
