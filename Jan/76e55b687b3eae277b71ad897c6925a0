PEOPLE had no clue what was in the handbag on the side of the road. Then they heard a baby crying. Last Monday, shocked residents of Sunnyside, Tshwane called the cops, who were stunned to find a three-week-old baby girl in the bag. The child was rushed to hospital and is recovering in an incubator. Police are looking for Lebogang Botolo in connection with a case of child neglect. Captain Daniel Mavimbela said they visited the baby girl on Thursday and her condition had improved. He appealed for help to find Botolo. “Anyone who knows of her whereabouts should call the police. If you don’t want to keep your baby, use the 24-hour baby bins at the corners of Spuy and Vos, Steve Biko and Jorissen streets in Sunnyside,” he said.
