Springbok captain Siyabonga Kolisi’s comments in a recent interview has landed him in hot water with Black Twitter. Kolisi stated that the former statesman Nelson Mandela would not support the quota system in sports. He furthermore said that he would have never made it to the top had he not gone to an English school. These comments earned the fury of Mzansi’s Twitter! The recent interview took place in December with Japan’s Kyodo News. He was visiting the Asian country in his capacity as an ambassador for Japanese electronics company Panasonic. “I don’t think he (Mandela) would have supported that (quotas system) but I don't know him‚" Kolisi said. He also said that he wouldn’t have made it to the top had he not gone to an ‘English’ school. “Imagine I didn’t go to an English school‚” Kolisi said. “He must just concentrate on playing better rugby. It's not his call. He benefited from this quota system,” @malatjie_aubrey tweeted. Others, however, believed that Kolisi had a point. “But Siya has a point, although he doesn't really know how to explain it,” @lusindis tweeted. “We need to develop our black sport in the low level, academically and technically. “Our government is failing on that side.” “There are already black players in the system that are being over looked,” @herbedie said. “The problem here is SARU (South African Rugby Union) that refuses to open doors to players of color. Transformation in rugby is overdue and should happen and can happen immediately!” Today he thinks he is better than those that died fighting that he can wear the springboks jersey. #SiyaKolisi doesn't need engagement, he needs a freaken tire around his neckHe needs to be reminded that he is black and someone's life was sacrificed so he can be where he is now
