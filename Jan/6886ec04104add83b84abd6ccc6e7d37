JOBURG West police are shutting down illegal shebeens in the area. As part of the Buya Mthetho operation that started on Thursday and will run throughout the year, cops seized a large amount of booze from illegal shebeens and closed them down permanently. Honeydew police spokesman Balan Muthan told Daily Sun he hoped this would send a strong message to those selling booze and cigarettes without licences. “We’re sure this will lower the crime rate in communities.” Muthan said they were also removing noisy sound equipment, which bothered the residents. “We’re not here to play. We will work overtime and do whatever it takes to end crime.” He said they seized booze worth a litle more that R40 000 and planned to shut down more illegal taverns. Cops also found a drug manufacturing laboratory at Steynsvlei plot in Muldersdrift on Friday afternoon. Brigadier Ngwako Mashao said four suspects aged between 25 and 36 were bust for possession and cultivation of drugs. “These included MDMA and ecstasy tablets, 40 bags and packs of mushrooms, dagga and crushed dagga packs, as well as 18 unknown capsules,” he said. Mashao said the suspects were expected to appear in court soon. A 29-year-old man was bust for in possession of substances suspected to be drugs on the R24.
