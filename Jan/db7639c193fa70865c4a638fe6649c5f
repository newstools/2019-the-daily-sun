BOOZE and drug abuse has been blamed for the rising number of deaths at initiation schools. At least 21 boys died during summer initiation season. Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders chairman Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana, said loopholes in the Eastern Cape Customary Male Initiation Practice Act needed to be corrected. Nonkonyana, who is also chairman of the provincial co-ordinating committee, said drug abuse among initiates also contributed to unwanted deaths. “These boys drink before going for circumcision. “Liquor requires one to drink lots of water, and when they don’t get it it leads to deaths.” He said some of the initiates were left unsupervised. “The reason is because they don’t want to be controlled. They drink and smoke whoonga,” he said. Nonkonyana said they had a meeting with MECs for safety and liaison, co-operative governance and traditional affairs, health, arts and culture, as well as the NPA over the deaths. “We found there is a custom issue not being followed and there are loopholes in the act and we will strengthen it,” he said. He called on parents and boys going through initiation to follow procedure and respect the law. Co-operative governance spokesman Mamkeli Ngam said the summer season initiation report had yet to be compiled. “It will show if there is a need for change in the efforts to ensure zero deaths and injuries.”
