WHILE some
of us are back on the grind, television and radio personality Pearl Modiadie is
having the time of her life with her new beau. The star, who is rumoured to be
dating a French heartthrob, is currently on baecation in Paris and judging by
the pictures on social media, she is having a blast. Her former
fiancée Nkululeko Buthelezi is probably leaking his wounds now that the Metro
FM presenter seems to have moved on with her life. Our sister publication
Sunday Sun reported last year that Pearl had put her nuptials on ice. But now
she is happily in love, according to our sources. “She is very happy with her
new man and the chapter she started after Nkululeko. She surprised us all with
her new bae, but the most important thing is that she is having a great time
and is happy,” an insider said. ...to us???? A post shared by  P E A R L ?? M O D I A D I E (@pearlmodiadie) on Jan 3, 2019 at 8:04am PST
