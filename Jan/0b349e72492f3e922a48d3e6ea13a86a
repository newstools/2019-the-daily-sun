ALL hell broke loose in Lagos, Nigeria when a madala was
bust stealing bras and panties off washing lines. According to Punch, the unnamed man was spotted on
Thursday stuffing underwear he grabbed off neighbourhood washing lines into a
bag he was carrying. Eyewitness Bayo Ojo said: “We were upstairs and all of a
sudden, one of us, Tunde, saw an elderly man picking up bras, pants and some
clothes that were spread outside. “When he was done, he looked in different directions to
ensure that nobody saw him. As he began walking away with those items, we came
down and alerted other residents, who stopped him. “Rather than being remorseful, the man began threatening
that he would deal with us for insulting him. “When the people asked him to open the bag he was
carrying, he bragged that he was going to beat them up. But when the people
forced him to open the bag, they were surprised to see bras, pants and clothes
in the bag.” An angry crowd gathered, demanding to know what he had
been meaning to do with the underwear, but the madala refused to speak. He was about to be moered when a cop rescued him from the
furious residents. Underwear theft seems to be a problem in recent times in
Lagos. Just two days earlier, two young men were bust stealing female underwear
from washing lines.
