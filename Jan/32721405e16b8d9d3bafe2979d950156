Rapper, Emtee is looking for someone to help him clean up his image and take his career to the next level. Preferably, someone who knows the Hip-Hop/Rap streets well and also knows how to build/maintain a personal brand. And in these SA streets, apparently there’s no one better than TV and radio personality and Hip-Hop head, Sizwe Dhlomo. Emtee reached out to Sizwe on Twitter to see if they could perhaps work on some sort of management arrangement. ICYMI: SIZWE DHLOMO CALLS VUSI THEMBEKWAYO AN IDIOT! “@SizweDhlomo ever thought of managing an artist?” Emtee asked. Admittedly, Emtee does have a lot of cleaning up to do and he could use with a manager that knows how to take him to new heights. But in all honesty, it is his personal image that needs cleaning up since his music is incredible and there is no one questioning Emtee’s indelible mark on the local Hip-Hop scene. Unfortunately, Sizwe isn’t looking to manage any one at the moment.

I’m about to call you,” he told Emtee. Well, if Sizwe can’t manage him, then a mentor-mentee relationship will have to suffice. We look forward to seeing the fruits of this labour.
