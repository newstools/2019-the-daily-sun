A TEENAGE sangoma and her mum are fuming after the girl was apparently humiliated and insulted by her principal. Bongiwe Ngobese (15) told Daily Sun the principal accused her of being possessed by a demon and said she would bring evil spirits to the school. The grade 10 pupil at Sunward Park High School in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, said the trouble started on Thursday when she handed in a letter from her mum asking for permission for her to wear her beads. “There were three other teachers there. The principal told me not to get close to her with my beads and said I have demons,” she claimed. “One of the teachers said they won’t allow this in school. I was hurt. “We have different cultures, religions and beliefs at school, but mine was treated with hatred.” Bongiwe had to leave school last year to do her thwasa training. Her parents informed the principal before she left and before she returned. Her mum Yvonne (43) said the deputy principal had assured her everything was okay. But when Bongiwe returned to school this year, she was told to remove or hide her beads. Yvonne said: “We’re angered by the principal’s conduct, which amounts to discrimination. “She should have communicated with us as parents, rather than attack the child.” The SunTeam tried to get in touch with Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona for three days, with no success.
