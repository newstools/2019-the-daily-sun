A FUMING 23-year-old mother from Sydenham, Durban wants her baby daddy to learn a lesson behind bars. She found her five-year-old son with bruises all over his body. The mum, who doesn’t live with her son, said she went to visit her son on 9 January at his father’s place, where he lived. She said she had the shock of her life. “I was happy that I was going to see my son after a long time but my joy was cut short when I saw bruises all over his body. I first noticed the bruises on his face and when I took his T-shirt off, he had more bruises all over. I asked him what happened and he told me his father had beaten him,” she said. She confronted the father and was told that her son had insulted people who were passing the house. “He told me that he beat him because he disrespected elderly people and that I must stop making it a big deal. “What angers me the most is that he doesn’t see anything wrong with what he did. “I want justice for my child. I want him to learn a lesson never to touch my child again,” said the mum. She said she took her son to live with her. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of child abuse was opened at Sydenham Police Station. “The child sustained multiple injuries on the face and back. “He was taken to hospital. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Gwala.
