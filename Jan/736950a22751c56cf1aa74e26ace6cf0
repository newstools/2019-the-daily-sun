MARITZBURG United have signed striker Judas Moseamedi to bolster their striking department. Moseamedi, who spent the first half of the season on-loan at Free State Stars from Cape Town City, has reunited with his former coach Muhsin Ertugral. Our source said the rest of the new signings will be announced tomorrow. Yannick Zakri’s disappearance has caused a lot of harm to Maritzburg, who are left wanting upfront. Making matters worse, Mohau Mokate is out injured. Meanwhile, Polokwane City chairman Johnny Mogaladi says only the, coach Jozef Vukusic, gives reasons why strikers – Rodney Ramagalela and Puleng Tlolane – are frozen out of the team. SunSport has learnt that Tlolane and Ramagalela are refusing to renew their respective contract expiring in June. “Tlolane is not playing because he wants to leave,” said the source. Ramagalela wrote on his Twitter account: “No matter the situation, never let your emotions overpower your intelligence.”
