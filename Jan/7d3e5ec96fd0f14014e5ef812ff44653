ONLY a reckless gambler would have bet on AmaZulu breaking Mamelodi Sundowns’ 14-match unbeaten league run. But like good things, the Brazilians fine run had to end at some point... And so it did with a shock 2-0 loss to unfancied Usuthu at Loftus Verfeld last night. An own-goal from Tebogo Langerman and Ovidy Karuru’s second-half header ensured the visitors hit the 20-point mark after 19 matches. It hasn’t been a good week for the Tshwane giants, who are reeling from the early Nedbank Cup knock out. Then there is the controversy created by Toni Silva, who penned a scathing letter about Pitso Mosimane. But that is not to take the shine from AmaZulu, who got the job done. Not so long ago they were bottom of the log, having been stripped of six points by a Fifa ruling. Quite amazing how things have turned for them in last 10 matches. They have certainly been a hoodoo side for Sundowns his season, having chalked up four points against the defending league champions. The last match between the two sides produced a thrilling 3-all and the fast-paced start suggested we were for an exciting sequel at Loftus. AmaZulu were the first to test the waters as Jabulani Ncobeni solicited a fine save from Denis Onyango on the second minute. Disaster struck for the Brazilians as Langerman scored an own-goal, attempting to clear from Anele Ngcongca’s mess. A fatal back-pass from the former Bafana Bafana right-back landed bounced off Langerman leg and into the net. Hlompho Kekana nearly leveled with a well-taken free-kick, but Downs just couldn’t find a way past Siyabonga Mbatha going into the break. It went from bad to worse for the hosts as Usuthu added the second, Karuru heading in from a corner kick in the 65th minute. One could argue Sundowns missed numerous chances, especially in the first half. But so did AmaZulu, who produced a top-drawer performance.
