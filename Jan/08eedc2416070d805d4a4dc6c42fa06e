BUSINESSWOMAN Buyelwa Mhonko from Mfuleni,Cape Town wants to change pupils’ lives. She has already provided shoes, food and toiletries to over 300 children in her area. She was heartbroken to learn most pupils only had flip-flops, takkies or sandals. She handed out food and shoes to pupils at the local clinic on Friday. Grade 8 pupil Masixole Mtuyedwa (14) said because his mum wasn’t working, he didn’t have shoes, a school bag or stationery.“I’m happy I got my own pair of shoes. “Buyelwa rescued us.’’ Zolile Maphaza (57) said: “We depend on grants. Today, my grandchild Atoyi Maphaza (15) got new shoes and is going to get food at school. My heart is lighter now.’’ Xolisile Qwesha, deputy chairwoman of the school steering committee, said: “We’re happy to see people care about kids in our area. “Thank you, Buyelwa.’’
