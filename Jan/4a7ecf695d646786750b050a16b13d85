NATIONAL First Division (NFD) side, Real Kings, are assessing former Orlando Pirates defender Ayanda Gcaba. Gcaba, who joined Bucs from Free State Stars in 2012-13 season, has been clubless in the first half of the season after he parted ways with the Buccaneers at the end of last season. The 32-year-old tried his luck at Highlands Park and at Black Leopards before the season got underway, but nothing materialised in those clubs. The Port Shepstone-born player yesterday played a friendly for the Magic Boys against Golden Arrows. Club official Philani Majola said they are aware that Gcaba hasn’t played any football ever since last season, “and probably in the next few days we’ll decide what is the way forward”. Gcaba was part of the Pirates side that last won the Nedbank Cup in 2014 when they defeated Bidvest Wits in Durban. He also played a big role in Bucs’ sojourn in the Caf Champions League final in 2013 when they lost to Al Ahly, and two years later in the Caf Confederation Cup when they lost to Etoil du Sahel. For that African experience, he was later called up to be part of Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba’s Bafana Bafana squad for the injured Patrick Phungwayo for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Equatorial Guinea in 2015.
