One of Mzansi’s all-time favourite personalities, Phuti Khomo has taken some time out to heal her soul. The busy Actress, Model and all-round star on a spiritual quest in India. Like all of us, our stars also need to take some down time, to recharge and reconnect with themselves. The only difference is, celebs do it five star style. Phuti has been in India for three days now, visiting tombs, temples and mosques, as well as other historic monuments. She’s doing all of this in India’s beautiful capital of Delhi where in addition to praying and reconnecting to herself, Phuti is serving fashionable looks. Day one saw her frolicking around the city in a floor-length, green maxi dress and a green fur coat, accessorized with over-sized sunnies and a doek. On day two she wore a floor-length, white lace dress covered with an over-sized, mustard garment. “Life is about experiences, and God willing, I intend to have a lot. I’m just a cup that’s half full, I always want to see more, know more, feel more, so I can BE MORE,” she said. Phuti seems to be alone on trip as she not just there for pleasure, but on a journey of self-discovery. “You can’t help but feel closer to your God, in any place of worship,” she said as she visited a mosque.
