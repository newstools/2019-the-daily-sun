AFTER she graduated as a sangoma in 2007, she didn’t know what her ancestors expected of her. That led to her battling with her calling for years, but despite being poor she had to help others. Rose Seema from Ga-Rankuwa View, north of Tshwane, has become a beacon of hope for nyaope addicts in her community. Last year, she was touched when Bluetooth users injected themselves in front of her, which led to her cooking for them. She said her ancestors sent the addicts to her. Rose said she cooked for 85 nyaope addicts every Saturday! “I cook pap and meat and give them snacks and fruit when I have enough money.” Her husband Danny helps her. “On most weekends he buys the ingredients for me.” Her passion for helping has given her life meaning. “Their smiles make it worthwhile when we serve them food. “Most aren’t happy with their addiction. “I’ve spoken to social workers for them to go to rehab.” Bizozo Mashishi (31) said: “She doesn’t work but makes sure we’re fed. People curse us like dogs, but she loves us.”
