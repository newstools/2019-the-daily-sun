HAVING starred in a number of local soapies such as Isidingo, Scandal! And many others, Hlomla Dandala, who is currently on 1Magic’s hit telenovela The River, is no stranger to the small screen and has over the years, cemented his place in show business. He is also not one to mince his words, especially on social media, so when he expressed an opinion about the state of Yeoville, Hillbrow and Berea, he was taken on by fellow thespian Pamela Nomvete. But, that didn’t stop heartthrob from defending his opinion. “Driving through Yeoville and Hillbrow reminds one of how much we’ve lost to foreign African nationals. Call it xenophobia all you like but truth is truth,” he wrote. The hunk’s tweet drew the ire of renowned Pamela, who disagreed with Hloma’s opinion and wrote: “You know I am in the UK at the moment and this dangerous way of thinking is prevalent here against "foreigners ". South Africans are included in this. They look at all non British as bringing the quality of the country down. Short sighted and dangerously delusion. Sad”. In his defense, Hlomla replied: “Again this is not about foreign nationals but about a specific mafia that did ruin those neighborhoods. I agree with tolerance. I also agree with law abiding. Tolerance can’t and shouldn’t trump rule of law”. However, the Lockdown actress didn’t back down and responded: “So your sentiment is not a healthy one because it breeds this sense of negating our humanity. You attack foreigners at home your people are being attacked as foreigners elsewhere. Respect, tolerance and respect for all human dignity. Not misguided prejudice.”
