THE family of former Numsa president Cedric Gina is waiting for doctors to confirm the cause of his death. The 48-year-old from Richards Bay in KZN died at a Durban hospital in the early hours of Monday morning after a short illness. Family spokesman Bongani Gina said they were shocked by his sudden death. “He was strong and when he went to hospital in November, we thought it was something that would pass soon but things got worse and he went back to hospital on 23 December.” Bogani said when Gina died he was an advisor for the Liberated Metalworkers Union of South Africa. He was previously the secretary- general. Gina left behind two kids. The family is still busy with funeral arrangements.
