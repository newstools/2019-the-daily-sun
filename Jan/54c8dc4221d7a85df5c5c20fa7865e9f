POLICE arrested nine union leaders amid a crackdown to discourage teachers from embarking on a strike. The officials of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers’ Union of Zimbabwe, who have since been released, were bust while planning to march to the offices of Finance and Economic Development Minister Mthuli Ncube in Harare. They intended to camp outside until government paid their salaries in foreign currency and paid their outstanding annual bonuses. They also demanded more learning materials, the scrapping of tax on online transactions and salary adjustments. The strike halted the reopening of schools yesterday. Public Service Minister July Moyo said government would disclose its offer soon. – CAJ NEWS
