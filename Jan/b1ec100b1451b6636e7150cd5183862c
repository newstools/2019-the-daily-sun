ORLANDO Pirates aim to register their first win in the Caf Champions League Group stages on Friday night(6pm). Bucs face Guinea giants Horoya Athletic Club in a Group B match at Orlando Stadium. The Soweto giants come to this clash following a disappointing goalless draw against Zimbabwean side FC Platinum in Bulawayo last week. But Bucs were lucky considering Horoya drew with Tunisian side Esperance, which means all the teams in the group are equal on one point. Now Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic knows that his side cannot afford to draw again or lose at home if they are to reach the knockout stages. But the Soweto giants won’t have an easy passage to glory, considering Horoya have always given PSL teams a tough time in Caf competitions and Mamelodi Sundowns can attest to that. Micho should get advice from Downs coach Pitso Mosimane on how to overcome Horoya, as the 2016 Champions League winners met Patrice Neveu’s charges three times last year. Horoya drew goalless with The Brazilians at home and 2-2 away. Micho is aware that defeat against Horoya tonight and a win in the other a match between FC Platinum and Esperanc match will put pressure on Pirates. Esperance host Platinum at Stade Olympique de Rades tonight (9pm). Pirates fans are desperate to have a second star on their jersey as they last won the competition in 1995. This was when they beat Ivory Coast giants Asec Mimosas 1-0 via Jerry Skhosana’s goal. And this time their fans believe they have a strong squad capable of challenging for the trophy, having lost the final in 2013 to Egyptian side Al Ahly, who beat them 3-1. Bucs will pin their hopes on the shoulders of wingers Thembinkosi Lorch and Vincent Pule. The duo have scored nine league goals between them. But the home side will need to keep a close eye on Horoya stars such as Ocansey Mandela, Bolaji Sakin and Brefo Mensah.
