MARITZBURG United have appointed Eric Tinkler as their new head coach, replacing Muhsin Ertugral who was fired on Monday. Ertugral was appointed by United chairman, Farook Kadodia, on 28 December to replace Fadlu Davids, but was kicked out following another blunder when they were knocked out of the Nedbank Cup by Witbank Spurs on Sunday. In his stay with the club Ertugral lost four league matches and was also knocked out in the first round of the Ke Yona Cup by National First Division stragglers, Spurs. The 48-year-old former Pirates, Cape Town City and SuperSport mentor was himself sacked as Chippa United head coach in December and will be keen to resurrect his managerial career. Since leaving Cape Town City for SuperSport United at the end of the 2016/2017 season, Tinkler lasted just nine months at the Tshwane club before then being sacked again by Chippa after a disastrous three month spell.Maritzburg are a team in crisis rooted to the bottom of the Absa Premiership standings having collected just 11 points from 18 games.Tinkler's first area of concern will be to improve the team's attack with Maritzburg having only scored an astonishing 6 league goals so far this season, resulting in them being four points adrift in 16th spot. Meanwhile, Thabo Rakhale was seen at Unitedâ€™s offices yesterday, which prompted rumours he might join the club before the transfer window closes on Thursday.
