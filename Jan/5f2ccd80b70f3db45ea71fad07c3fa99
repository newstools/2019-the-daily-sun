THE thugs tried to rob the cop’s home on Monday, thinking she was on night duty, but they got a nasty surprise. She was home and killed one of the men with a brick! Residents of Mfuleni, Cape Town outside the cop’s home told the SunTeam the thugs got in through a window, which didn’t have burglar bars. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the incident happened at about 2.30am. “The cop, who is stationed at the Philippi station, was sleeping when she heard a window breaking. She saw three men in the house. One had a knife and had her TV. “The victim grabbed a brick and threw it at the suspects. One of them was found dead. A 21-year-old was arrested. The third man is on the run.” Resident Anele Mbuyisa (38) told the SunTeam they only heard about it the next morning. Nosiphiwo Guduza (25) said: “I would have fainted!” Rwexana said an inquest docket was opened and they were looking for the third suspect.
