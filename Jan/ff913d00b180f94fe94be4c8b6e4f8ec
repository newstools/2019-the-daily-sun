SHE carried a sexy little red bag along with her luggage. But inside, it hid a terrible secret! A 39-year-old woman was bust by the narcotics task team at OR Tambo International Airport on Sunday with drugs worth over R3 million. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Katlego Mogale said the woman was heading to Cape Town from Sao Paolo, Brazil. “Her check-in luggage was intercepted and taken to the search area. “Three blocks wrapped in black plastic and further wrapped in blankets were found. Preliminary testing confirmed the contents of the blocks to be illegal drugs weighing over 10kg, with an estimated street value of R3,3 million,” said Mogale. The suspect is expected to appear in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court today in connection with dealing and possession of illegal drugs.
