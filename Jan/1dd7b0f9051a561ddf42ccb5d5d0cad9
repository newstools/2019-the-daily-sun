SOCIAL media users have attacked Finance Minister Tito
Mboweni for saying the country is shooting itself down for phasing out
Afrikaans at Tuks. The University of Pretoria (Tukkies) recently announced that
it will be phasing out Afrikaans as medium of instruction. However, student that registered before 2019 will be still
have the opportunity to be taught in Afrikaans. “I publicly, and in my personal capacity, DISAGREE, with the
phasing out of Afrikaans as one of the mediums of teaching at the University of
Pretoria. As a country, you are shooting yourselves down. You will
regret it in 30 years’ time,” Mboweni Twitted on Thursday. According to the university, between 1992 and 2015 students
who registered Afrikaans at the university as a mother tongue decreased by 50%. Meanwhile, social media users began criticizing the minister
for his views. “If Afrikaans is kept as a medium of instruction then Economics
and other courses like Accounting should be taught in Zulu, Tsonga, Sotho etc.
because Afrikaans is not superior to indigenous languages. English is a
compromise for everyone,” said Twitter user Bongani_SP.
