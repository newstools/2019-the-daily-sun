SHE was shot dead right outside her home! Residents said this was not the first time someone had tried to kill the woman. The Delft community in Cape Town is still in shock. Limise Qotyeni (36) told Daily Sun they heard gun shots on Sunday at about 7.30am. “It was just two shots. “Even though we don’t know why she was killed, this looks like a hit because she was going to meet her husband in the car.” A man said he saw the man who killed the woman. “I was going to the shop when I saw him. He was smoking a cigarette. “After a few minutes, I heard gun shots.” He said the woman’s husband saw everything and tried to catch the suspect but he ran away. “I feel for that man. He saw his wife being killed and couldn’t do anything about it.” He said the woman was still wearing a gown and was shot in the head. Many of the residents told Daily Sun they didn’t believe the suspect wanted to rob the couple as he could have killed them both and taken their car. Moses Madolo (38) said the woman escaped three hits before this. “They have been gunning for her for a long time and finally killed her. This is sad.” The woman apparently had a six-month-old baby girl. Provincial police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder was opened after a shooting at Rosin Street in Delft. She said police had responded to a complaint at the address where they found a fatally wounded 27-year-old woman. “Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation. “No arrests have been made at this stage,” said Rwexana.
