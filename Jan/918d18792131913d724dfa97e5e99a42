Enos, from Ramotse, near Hammanskaal in Tshwane, said he was stuck on the N1 highway while on his way home from Limpopo over the weekend. He stood on the side of the road begging for help for hours until the man helped him. “He told me his battery was new and would get my car to where I was going.” He said the man was driving a fancy car and he didn’t get his name.
