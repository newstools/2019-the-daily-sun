WESTERN Cape Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said attacks fuelled by alcohol put a huge burden on healthcare facilities during the festive season. “Numerous crashes kept our emergency medical and forensic pathology personnel busy. Staff at our emergency centres had to bear the brunt of an additional burden of cases fuelled by alcohol abuse.” Mbombo said between 15 December and 15 January, over 30 000 emergency patients were taken to hospitals by emergency medical personnel. Of the cases, 8 069 were the result of patients sustaining injuries from stabbings, gunshots and accidental injury. “The estimated cost for treating a patient with a gunshot injury is R22 000. If the patient requires orthopaedic surgery, R25 000 more is needed. “These costs exclude transport, treatment received in an emergency centre and rehabilitation or forensic pathology.”
