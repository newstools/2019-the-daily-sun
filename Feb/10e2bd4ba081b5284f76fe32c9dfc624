ON WEDNESDAY, Bushbuckridge mayor Sylvia Nxumalo announced that the municipality is terminating its agreement with Rand Water. The municipality will now take over the responsibility to supply water to residents. When asked by Daily Sun why the municipality is taking over from the water supply experts, the mayor responded that it was mainly due to budget considerations. According to her, the municipality would save R12 million a month, compared to the R24 million they paid Rand Water. “Two years ago, we realised our budget doesn’t allow us to continue working with Rand Water. The decision has been communicated to the office of the co-operative governance MEC and the ministry of water and sanitation.” “We will absorb the Rand Water employees who were distributing water to ensure an uninterrupted distribution and supply of water to residents.” The mayor said they would employ all 147 of the organisation’s employees at the municipality. “We will also use bulk water through boreholes while awaiting yard water reticulation projects in the outstanding areas.” The mayor also said they would use the newly built water treatment plant to extract and purify water from the Sabie River.
