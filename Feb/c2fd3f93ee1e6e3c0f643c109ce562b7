FORMER president Jacob Zuma received a warm welcome at Mathabo Secondary School on Wednesday. Zuma addressed a crowd of about 1 200 people at the school in Qholaqhwe kasi in QwaQwa, Free State. Speaking about accusations that the country went backwards during his presidency, Zuma said: “The ANC has a history of helping the people of South Africa.” He claimed although mistakes were made, the ANC always delivered. “We’ve changed the lives of many people since 1994 and we ask every South African above the age of 18 to vote for the ANC,” he said. Zuma insisted that other parties just made a noise ahead of elections and forgot to interact with residents after the elections. Zuma, who was accompanied by Maluti-a-Phofung municipal officials and Free State Health MEC Montsheng Tsiu, said: “I have no doubt that after the election, most of them will be no more.” He gave laptops to matric pupils Bongani Msimanga (18) and Matjele Morebodi (18).
