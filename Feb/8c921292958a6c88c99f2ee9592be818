Love him or hate him Prophet Bushiri is a news maker. AND now people are making hits about his arrest. Prophet Shepherd Bushiri was arrested by the hawks on Friday and ever since, Mzansi’s social media has been set alight with memes and songs about his arrest. And one question that was one everyone’s minds was finally asked by marketing guru, Khaya Dlanga. As always, Bushiri’s followers were on hand to defend their “Papa” claiming that he had actually prophecied his arrest. Some people took it a step further though, they released songs celebrating the Prophet’s arrest. Controversial account parody account, Man’s Not Barry Roux shared the video of the late Mpharanyana's song with the lyrics that loosely translate to “They’ve arrested the satan. He is in PTA.” But it was Anzani Matodzi who took the cake, Matodzi remixed Mlindo’s Amablesser. Her Venda rendition tells the story of how the Prophet was nabbed by the Hawks.
