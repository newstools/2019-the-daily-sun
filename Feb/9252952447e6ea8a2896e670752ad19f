Members of the South African National Civic Organisation braved the rainy weather to make their voices heard following outcries that intern doctors had not received their January salaries. The protest was held outside the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital casualty area yesterday. They were supported by Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng. Members vowed to protest on behalf of doctors and other medical staff whose interests were not taken into account by hospital management. “Our people are dying on hospital benches waiting for doctors,” said Sanco spokesman Simphiwe Hlafa. “It is time the authorities took into consideration issues raised by the doctors who work in appalling conditions at Bara. “Issues such as the shortage of equipment or tools, porters, cleaning staff and nurses need to be addressed.” Hlafa said Baragwanath was in Soweto, so the budget and laws regulating the hospital were still informed by apartheid planning and budgets. Mboro said the majority of those who suffered were the poorest of the poor who could not afford private healthcare. He said they had no choice but to wait for long hours, sometimes even days, to be checked by medical staff. A protest to support medical staff will be held at the hospital on Thursday.
