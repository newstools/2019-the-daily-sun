A GROUP of protesters on Tuesday set a bus alight and barricaded roads in Gelvandale and Bethelsdorp. The group is believed to have been protesting for better service delivery. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg saidroads were blocked in the Northern Areas. No one was injured. “Five people where arrested. The two men and three women, aged between 28 and 35, will appear in the Gelvandale Magistrates Court today. “Police will continue to monitor the situation, and motorists are urged to use alternative routes.” Algoa Bus CEO Sicelo Duze said: “Our buses are always burnt during service delivery protests which have nothing to do with us. “It is important for politicians to understand that once you make a promise, that promise leads to expectation, which leads to entitlement, and that leads to violence. “That is the situation this company finds itself in. Politicians need to be held responsible for what they promise,” he said. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Miniki’s phone went to voicemail when Daily Sun tried to call him.
