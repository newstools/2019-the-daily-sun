COMEDIAN and The Daily Show host Trevor Noah had the world eating out of the palm of his hands when he presented an award at the Oscars on Sunday. He made people at the Oscars to think that Wakanda, the fictional African homeland of Black Panther, is a real place. While speaking about one of the Best Picture nominees, Black Panther, he put Mzansi on the map by cracking a joke that only South Africans would understand. “Growing up as a young boy in Wakanda, I would see our king T’Challa flying over our village and he would remind me of a great Xhosa phrase ‘abelungu abazi uba ndiyaxoka’,” said Trevor.  He claimed the phrase meant: “In times like these, we are stronger when we fight together rather than when we try to fight apart.” The audience cheered loudly, but that’s not what the phrase means at all. It means, “White people don’t know that I’m lying.” Many South African Twitter users called it an inside joke, and those who do not understand Xhosa chuckled when they found out what it actually meant.
