BANYANA Banyana forward Linda Motlhalo says they are looking forward to testing themselves against tough European opposition. Banyana, who did well on the continent, finishing second at the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) in Ghana last year, are looking for similar success against the world’s best. They qualified for their maiden FIFA Women’s World Cup set to be staged in France from 7 June to 7 July. Desiree Ellis’ charges will use the upcoming Cyprus Women’s Cup to prepare for the World Cup. Banyana are in Group A alongside Finland, Czech Republic and Korea DPR. They play Finland in their opening fixture of the tournament on Wednesday at GSZ Stadium, Larnaca (1.pm) Motlhalo, who will be playing in her second Cyprus Cup, says they are looking for an improved showing this time around. “We are going to playing against highly-ranked teams, so our aim is to improve from last year’s position six to finish a bit higher, and don’t discount the chances of us winning it, but we will take it game by game,” Motlhalo told Safa’s official website. “This has become a very important tournament for us, more so because we are using it to prepare for the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. “So we have to go there and give our all as though we are already at the World Cup, because these are the types of conditions and opponents we will face in France, but I think we will do well this time around, there is a lot of positivity and fight for places in the team, and that is very exciting as it makes us work even harder.”
