THE EDUCATION department wants to restore order at Moses Mnisi High School in Cottondale near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane told Daily Sun that after a lengthy meeting between the department and parents on Tuesday, it was agreed that lessons would resume. This follows an incident on Monday when the school was brought to a standstill after two rival gangs used knives, pangas and axes, and set dogs on each other during a fight. The story was published in Daily Sun yesterday. Pupils have since raised their concerns about a message circulating on social media saying that a pupil must die. They said they feared chaos might erupt again. They wanted cops to assure them they would be safe. Principal Harry Moyo said some teachers were assaulted but protected by other pupils. Police spokeswoman Captain Lindiwe Nghondzweni slammed the violence at the school. She assured parents, teachers and pupils they would monitor the school as soon as lessons resumed.
