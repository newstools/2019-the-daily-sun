WOMEN stripped down yesterday during a protest for jobs. The women from Cornubia in Verulam, north of Durban, blocked roads and demanded to see mayor Zandile Gumede. They were angry after the municipality brought in outsiders to work as refuse collectors. One of them said they stripped in order to be taken seriously after speaking to Councillor Siyabonga Thango, which didn’t help. She claimed Thango had told them not to rent out rooms in their RDP flats, yet they had no choice. Khoni Dube (56) said they had cleaned the area as volunteers and were furious when the municipality didn’t consider them for jobs. “We want the mayor to tell us if it’s fair to bring outsiders when we’re unemployed. We can’t move till she comes.” They were happy when the municipality built houses for them but were dumped. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said the mayor would wait for the councillor’s report before attending to the problem. Attempts to contact Thango failed.
