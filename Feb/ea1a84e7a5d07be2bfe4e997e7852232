A GRADE 1 pupil is living in fear after she was allegedly raped by an 11-year-old boy. The little girl from Matsulu, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, was allegedly raped in the school toilets last Friday. She told Daily Sun it was not the first time the boy had done this. She said she was scared to tell her teachers and parents because the boy threatened to kill her. Her mum (38) said she noticed there was something wrong with her daughter when she came back from school on Friday. “She peed on herself, and when I asked her why she begged me not to beat her and told me what had happened,” she said. They went to the clinic and later opened a case. The mum said she was not happy with how the school was handling the matter. “I asked the principal to call the suspect’s parents, but he didn’t. “I told him to suspend the boy, but he didn’t. Instead, he told me the suspsect also has rights. “My child is not going to school because she’s scared the boy might hurt her. “Her rights are not important. Meanwhile, that boy is still at school. She cries all night and it hurts me so much.” Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they were not aware of the matter but would request a report from the school. Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said a rape case had been opened.
