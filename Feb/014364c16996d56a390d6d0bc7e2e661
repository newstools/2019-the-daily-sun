WITNESSES described the offloading of beer bottles from a police truck as suspicious, but the cops have said it’s all above board and legal. The truck was spotted at a popular liquor store offloading empty bottles. A witness told Daily Sun that more than 10 crates of bottles were offloaded by the bottle store staff. The police were never seen taking cash, but witnesses wondered if the police presence at the bottle store involved personal financial gain. “This appears to be the misuse of state resources,” said a witness. The truck belonged to Meadowlands Police Station in Soweto. The vehicle apparently arrived with two male cops dressed in uniform and a woman in casual wear. Speaking about the incident, police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo praised the community for reporting any suspicious activities. But he said the liquor was poured down the drain after it was confiscated from an illegal outlet. “We sell empty bottles to legal operating liquor outlets and the money is deposited into the state account.”
