THE sisters know they’ll be on their feet when clouds gather, as water floods their shack when it rains. Sisters Slindile (38) and Lethiwe Vilakazi (36) from Eshowe in KZN told Daily Sun they have been waiting for an RDP for five years. They said their claim was approved in 2014 but not even a slab has been laid yet. They share a one-roomed shack with their five kids. Lethiwe said: “We hoped an RDP would relieve us of our misery. We put buckets on the beds.” She said they inherited the house from their parents. “When they died, we had nowhere else to go.” Slindile said the shack was in a bad condition. Planks often fall off and they covered damaged windows with cardboard and plastic. “We can’t afford to build a proper house. The councillor tells us getting an RDP takes long.” Councillor Sanele Thango didn’t answer his phone or respond to Daily Sun’s text message. Municipal spokesman Mkhuseli Buthelezi said Thango is a school principal and may be busy.
