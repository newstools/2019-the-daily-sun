Incredible Happenings Church Prophet Paseka Mboro Motsoeneng has called upon Pastor Alph Lukau of Alleluia International Ministries, to resurrect former President Nelson Mandela. This comes after Lukau's viral video that surfaced on social media over the weekend, were he allegedly resurrected a dead man at his church. "Following that we should go to every funeral parlour and raise the dead," Mboro said. He said it is clear that what Pastor Lukau had done is fraud. "Because if it is not fraud, why don't you give us explanations," Mboro asked the Pastor at the Alleluia International Ministries on Thursday. Pastor Mboro went on to ask the church why he received a letter stating that he would be sued. "You published a miracles, we can't talk about it. We have been quite, women paid R5000 each for a husband - we want to see the women and the husbands they got," Motsoeneng demanded. According to Mboro, he is not jealous of Lukau - he says if the pastor is able to do extraordinary things, then he (Mboro) should learn from him. "But if you are copying the original miracles that Pastor Mboro has been doing, then let us show you how to do the proper miracles," Mboro said.
