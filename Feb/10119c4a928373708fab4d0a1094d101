MASKANDI star Phuzekhemisi is back in the Durban Magistrates Court today. The musician (55), whose real name is Zibokwakhe Mnyandu, was first charged with attempted murder in December. He allegedly shot band member Selby Shezi (35) in the chest and arm during a heated argument. Selby died in hospital, two weeks after Phuzekhemisi was released on R3 000 bail. The charge is likely to be changed to murder. Selby’s brother Sbusiso said the family would be in court. “We don’t know what happened on the day, but we’re hoping all will be revealed in court. We lost our brother and his death was devastating,” he said. Phuzekhemisi said he was not allowed to comment on the matter as the case was still in court. According to a sworn statement made in December, he was in his car in Amanzimtoti with Selby and another band member when an argument started after Selby banged the door of Phuzekhemisi’s car. During the argument, Phuzekhemisi allegedly took out a gun and shot Selby in the chest, stomach and leg. Selby tried to take the gun from him, and Phuzekhemisi was shot in the forehead during the scuffle. Phuzekhemisi was carrying a gun while allegedly under the influence.
