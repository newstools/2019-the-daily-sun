RESIDENTS were gatvol of travelling long distances to the clinic, so they built their own health post. After it took the people of Lurhwayizo Village in Willowvale six years to finish building the structure with their own money, it was officially opened on Saturday. Mboniswa Rwayi, the chairman of the local clinic development committee, said they were tired of depending on Mpozolo Clinic, which is over 15km away. “We used a bus to get there which left our village early in the morning and came back at 6pm. When someone needed to go to Madwaleni Hospital, we had to collect at least R2 000 for private transport.” Mboniswa said many people had died on their way to the clinic and he believed the health stop would make a huge difference. It was opened by Eastern Cape Health MEC Helen Sauls-August, who also donated three wheelchairs to disabled residents. She said more villages should build their own health stops so trained medical officers could visit them once a month. “The reality is no government can build clinics for every village. “We encourage the construction of health posts. It’s participatory democracy.” Standford Ngwevu (78), who was given a wheelchair, said he hadn’t left his house since he had a stroke in 2002. “I couldn’t even go to the clinic. My life will change now.”
