 A fight broke out at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS) between students and security. The students staged a hunger strike at the universityâ€™s Solomon Mahlangu House, in solidarity with those who cannot register because of finances. The fight reportedly began when the security tried to disperse the student from Solomon House. The students say they were allowed to gather at Solomon House, as they staged their peaceful protest. On Monday, the WITS SRC disrupted lectures at the university saying the university backed out on an agreement, which stipulates that students owing less that R100 000 should be allowed to register. According to the SRC over 1000 students are unable to register and 500 have been left without a place to stay.
