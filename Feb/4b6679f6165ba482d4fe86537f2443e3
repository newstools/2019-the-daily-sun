Prophet Bushiri's church has released a statement after his arrest today on charges of fraud and money laundering. Important Notice: To all children of the Prophet This morning, around 07:00hrs in the morning armed members of the police stormed Sparkling Waters Hotel in Rustenburg, South Africa. We were later made aware that they were members of the Directorate for Priority Investigations (HAWKS). They took the Prophet and our mother Prophetess Mary Bushiri in handcuffs to Pretoria. They have charged our father with fraud and money laundering. As you will remember, from last year, we have struggled with reports that our father was guilty. He has been detained and is being questioned by the HAWKS in Silverton, Pretoria. We will give you more updates as we go.
