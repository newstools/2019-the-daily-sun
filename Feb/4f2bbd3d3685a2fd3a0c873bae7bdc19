ON Generations: The Legacy, he is Sikhumbuzo Dladla, a mashonisa who loves money. But in real life, he is Muzi Vilakazi, an actor who has to work hard to get what he wants! “People must know the difference. They mustn’t be afraid of me when I’m walking on the streets. I’m just acting,” he said. In the soapie, he meets his clients at Lucy’s tavern. “In the soapie, if people don’t settle their debts I make them pay. “I punish their families as well, but in real life I’m understanding and don’t hold grudges. “To me, money is a substance that makes life easier and I work hard for my money.” The 36-year-old actor and musician, born in Ngwavuma in KZN, said he lives a clean life and doesn’t associate with gangsters. “Being an actor is the most important thing in my life. “My family, cast and crew have been amazing and supportive. I’m happy. I’ve grown as an actor.” Muzi said being on the soapie was a dream come true, and he had to do his best in his four-month stay with the soapie. Muzi, who started playing the role in January, has also acted on Ingozi, Family Bonds and Rented Family. He released a single, Yangenelela, last year and is working on a full gospel album.
