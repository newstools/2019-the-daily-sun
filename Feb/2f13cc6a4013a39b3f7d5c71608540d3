EZIQHAMNGANENI villagers in Ngqamakhwe haven’t had water for over a year. They said officials from Amathole Municipality have done nothing to help them. Community leader Dumisani Ntloko said: “Our taps have been dry since December 2017. Other villages close to us have water. “The river is far and most people live on social grants. They have to hire people to fetch water, using the little money they get.” Dumisani said the situation was affecting their health. “Kids develop rashes. “Our government is a joke. Soon they will be asking for our votes but they can’t fix this problem, ” he said. Mayor Nomfusi Nxawe said there was a problem with people illegally connecting water to homes. “It makes the water pressure in the taps drop but I’m not saying there is no water only because of illegal connections. “Please give me the councillor’s name, so I can follow up.”
