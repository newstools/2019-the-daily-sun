THE Informal Settlement Upgrading Forum in Emalahleni has warned residents not to invade unoccupied land. On Tuesday the forum held a session with the department of human settlements to discuss the progress of squatter camp upgrades. Integrated human settlements and planning director Buyisiwe Zuma said: “Our overall planning is at an advanced stage as we have approved about 10 informal settlements for township development. “This is a great milestone considering the challenges we had on the ground.” “People should stop invading unoccupied land because that derails development. “Land must only be occupied when it is developed. “This makes it easy for municipalities to deliver services. “We are working closely with community development workers and councillors to monitor the issue of land invasion. “The national department of human settlements has commended the province for the good work it has done.” Project manager Lucas Morena said the forum would develop a guideline that would outline responsibilities. “This will be critical to deal with the upgrading of informal settlements in the province,” he said. “The forum’s job is to guide sound planning in line with the department and all stakeholders. “This is done to facilitate the creation of sustainable human settlements.”
