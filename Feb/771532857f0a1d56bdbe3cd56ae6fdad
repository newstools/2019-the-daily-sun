 ANC MP Fikile Mbalula has responded to
Trevor Manuel’s testimony at the State Capture Commission today regarding his
meetings with the Guptas. Mbaks was speaking to News24 and said:
“There is nothing in what Trevor Manuel said about me in relation to that
meeting and what I said that is untruthful. “I think he has said it. The way he
did, it is up to me to amplify and put into context. And I’m ready to do that. “So to hell with state capture. “It must never happen in this
generation and many generations to come. “To hell with state capture. It must be
fought in all avenues”
