VILLAGERS were happy two years ago after they found out a steel bridge would be built in their area. But the residents of Ngqakaqheni Village in Qumbu said they were concerned about how slowly the access roads to the new bridge are being built. They were speaking during the Mhlonto Municipality’s media tour of the R18 million project. Resident Gcobani Mongo said: “When this project started, we were hopeful people would not drown anymore. “The contractor is now nowhere to be seen and there’s no activity on the road. “We are starting to lose hope. The bridge is standing but the roads connected to it are not finished, so it is useless.” Another resident Mxokozeli Goloda said they rushed to the bridge after seeing municipal vehicles. “We were not sure why they were here. “We feared they had come to declare the bridge finished while it still needed a lot of work. “Some workers from the village have not even been paid,” he said. However, Thembakazi Mongo said she was grateful the municipality was doing something about the roads. “We also want a bus to come to our village so we don’t have to be dropped off in other villages. All my life I have lived here but I’m only now beginning to see change. However, it’s very slow.” The municipality’s Loyiso Yalezo said a lot of work still needed to be done. “We are here mainly to show our colleagues what we are busy with. “You will be notified when the project is finished,” he said.
