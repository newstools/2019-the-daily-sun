THIS gogo said she will die before she gets a key to an RDP house. Baboneng Bapela (89), from Mmakgwane Village outside Jane Furse, Limpopo said she’s been on the RDP waiting list since the project started. “It seems I will die without a decent house,” she said. Last December, the measurements were taken for her house, but now she claims the local councillor is saying her house cannot be build because she is no longer living in a collapsed mud house. “I built this collapsed mud house with my own hands more than 50 years ago. When it started to deteriorate two years ago, my grandchildren took me to a place of safety. I would have died inside when heavy rains destroy it,” said gogo Baboneng. Gogo Baboneng could have died in her mud house when it collapsed. She said ever since the RDP housing project started, she had been on the waiting list. The stories she is being told have confused her family. Her daughter Julia said she was told by Councillor Paul Diketane to demolish and remove the rubble of gogo’s collapsed mud house so that an RDP could be built, but weeks later the story changed again. “I hired people to create space by removing the rubble, but Diketane later told me they were only going to build a one-roomed house and a toilet. When asked about a proper house being built for her, his response was apparently, “Tlogelang ge le sa nyake”. Julia said after a community meeting a contractor was told not to build the house. Ward 25 Councillor Paul Diketane said: “The community members told us to stop building because the remaining of the mud house may be a place for criminals. “This family knows what they must do, otherwise there is nothing that we can do.”
