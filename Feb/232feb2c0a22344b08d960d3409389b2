 Controversial artist Ayanda Mabulu held an exhibition at Kalashnikovv Gallery in Braamfontein, Joburg. The painting that stood out was that of Winnie Mandela, and is a collaboration with designer Laduma Ngxokolo. Some said the painting was similar to Kehinde Wiley’s Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps. Wiley’s artwork is a remake of French artist Jacques-Louis David’s painting. Ayanda saidpeople want to comment on art but don’t understand it. He said: “Kehinde takes an old painting and brings it to the present. That is the same thing I did. Art is like jazz. You improvise and add on it.”
