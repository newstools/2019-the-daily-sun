The Mpumalanga department of human settlements said despite the tough financial year ahead of them, the delivery of houses will not stop. Department head Kebone Masange said: “Despite budget cuts, the province has managed to do far better than expected. We even got recognition at the annual Govan Mbeki Awards. “The province’s human settlements department was declared the best in terms of service delivery. “I am very happy with the progress we have made. “That does not mean we should relax as there is still a lot of work to be done. “Because of budgets, this year there will be a slight drop in the number of housing units and sites. “We hoped that since some provinces are failing to meet their targets, their grants would be given to us. “Unfortunately, that did not happen.” Masange said the department will do its best to provide housing to the needy.
