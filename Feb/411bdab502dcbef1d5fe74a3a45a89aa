MPUMALANGA police are investigating a case of business robbery and assault after a burglary at Tsakane Special School in Acornhoek, Bushbuckridge, on Saturday. The suspects allegedly took almost every resource meant to teach pupils, as well as office equipment. They assaulted the guard and vandalised the premises. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane pledged to work with the police to bring to book those who were behind the burglary. Speaking to Daily Sun, the guard said six men threatened to blow his brains out if he resisted giving them keys to the building. Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said police were working round the clock to catch the thugs.
