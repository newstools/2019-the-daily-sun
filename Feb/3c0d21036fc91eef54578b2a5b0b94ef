MKHULU is having sleepless nights! He’s terrorised by his father’s restless spirit. As a result, he wants to perform rituals for his late father, who committed suicide. Morris Golela (71) from Pongola, northern KZN, said before he dies he wants to perform rituals for his late father. “I will not rest in peace if I don’t do this for my father,” said Morris. “I pray that I don’t put my family through hell because of what I was supposed to do while I was alive.” He told Daily Sun that after his father died in 1960, his mum sold their house in Meadowlands, Soweto. “I was young and didn’t have a say in anything,” said Morris. His mum died in 2000. He said he respects that their old house doesn’t belong to them anymore. All he’s asking is to be allowed to perform the rituals. “Not everyone believes in these things, and I understand this. But we’re really desperate,” he said. He said he tried speaking to the owner of the house, but he refused. The People’s Paper spoke to Siphosethu Ngwane, who said he didn’t want his home associated with such things. “I will get a protection order against him. I told him how I feel but he doesn’t listen.”
