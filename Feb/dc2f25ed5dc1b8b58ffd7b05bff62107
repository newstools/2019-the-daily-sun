DOES Ernst Middendorp have the quality at Kaizer Chiefs to meet the demands of the job? Tinashe Nengomasha doesn’t think so. The Amakhosi legend reckons his former club need to recruit the right players for the team. Three seasons and counting, Chief are yet to put a new trophy in their cabinet. And this barren trophy-less run is likely to continue if the club doesn’t change their recruitment policy. “Sometimes you need to look for the right players, and the blend of players to win you trophies,” said Nengomasha. He was part of the Castle Lager’s inaugural Africa 5’s social media football league, spearheaded by football icon Samuel Eto’o. Launched in Soweto yesterday, the campaign includes Matthew Booth, Ivo Mapunda of Tanzania, Swaziland’s Siza Dlamini, Chris Katongo representing Zambia and Amanda Dlamini for women’s football. “You can bring any coach, but at the end of the day, if you don’t have the right material for the coach to work with, you won’t win anything,” said Nengomasha. “You can change coaches left, right and centre. But if you don’t have the correct players, you won’t win anything.” Nengomasha further advised Amakhosi to look into the development structures. “They can loan development players out and bring them back with a bit of experience,” he explained. “I once played with Thembinkosi Lorch at Cape Town All Stars and couldn’t understand when Eric Tinkler loaned him out at Pirates. But look at him now back at Bucs. “You can look at what others are doing and take a leaf out of their book. These are some of the things Chiefs need to look into.” The former Zimbabwean international, however, is hopeful Middendorp could bring change. “He’ll make something out of the material they have right now, and hopefully salvage the Nedbank Cup. But going into the future, they need to find the right players for Chiefs to win trophies,” he added.
