THE smile is completely gone as the reality of spending another two weeks behind bars hit rapper Thulani “Pitch Black Afro” Ngcobo yesterday. His case was once again postponed. This after his defence requested the services of a pathologist to verify whether his wife sustained injuries before or after she went back to the B&B. It was expected that magistrate Paul du Plessis would deliver his judgment on the bail application. Pitch Black Afro will be back in court on 21 February as it takes two weeks to apply for a pathologist to testify. The rapper faces charges of murdering his wife Tricia Modisane at a B&B in Joburg on 31 December and of defeating the ends of justice.
