AT LEAST eight people have been shot and killed in Port Elizabeth kasis over the past week. The murders are believed to be linked to a R21 million Nelson Mandela Bay project to give small businesses tenders to clean drains in the municipality. The latest victims are Vuyani Ndike (40) from New Brighton and Pamela Ngamlana (27) from Motherwell, who were killed on Sunday. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge told Daily Sun: “A man and a woman were shot in two separate incidents. “Ndike was shot by an unknown gunman at his house in New Brighton. The shooter fled on foot and Ndike died at the scene. “Ngamlana was shot several times in the arms and chest at her flat in Motherwell NU2 after men kicked open the door. She died on the scene.” Beetge said the motives for the murders were unknown. “Police will be investigating all avenues to determine if these are linked to other murders over the past week,” he said. Motherwell cluster commander Major-General Dawie Rabie called on the community to help cops bust the killers. Anyone with information should call Lieutenant-Colonel Willie Mayi on 082 697 5914.
