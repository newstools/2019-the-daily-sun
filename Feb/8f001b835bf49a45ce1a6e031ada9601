THE walls seem to be closing in on rapper Thulani “Pitch Black Afro” Ngcobo after his bail application was again postponed to Thursday. The rapper faces charges after his wife Catherine “Tricia” Modisane died at a Joburg B&B on 31 December. Yesterday, prosecutor Mzamo Mathe presented the evidence. Mathe asked magistrate Piet du Plessis to keep the shocking images out of the public eye to protect the dead woman’s family. All Pitch Black Afro could do was shake his head and stare at the floor. The defence argued that the prosecution did not have enough evidence. Du Plessis said the post mortem showed Modisane died from unnatural causes and said if the defence was arguing the accused did not commit the crime, they should present proof.
