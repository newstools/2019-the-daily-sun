Mecer’s new #WeAreAllSouthAfrican advert has divided South Africans. The ad is supposed to highlight the company’s commitment to our beautiful country and all the people who make up our rainbow nation. Mecer is truly proud of its new ad, it is what greets people when they land on their website. The 1:50 seconds long song shows a rapper guy, going through what seems to be their factory. There are wide-smiled workers making products including computers and computer screens. The workers are seen jaiving as the worker's rap lines like “Local is not kak”, “when we pull together we local is lekker, no need to be a bunch of mamparas” and Don’t be a moegoe, just because it is foreign doesn’t make it okay.” The rapper goes on and on repeating South African slang and phrases, changes to different traditional South African clothes in some cringe-worthy scenes reminiscent of the Blank Panther movie. Some users found the ad to be offensive, Sizwe Dlomo tweeted: “Guys if we don’t tag Mecer and their ad agency and tell them to drop that ad, we don’t know what we’re doing!” Other users thought the ad had some racist tones to it, But others user found nothing in the ad, saying that people are looking for issues where there are no issues.
