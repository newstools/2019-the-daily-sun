THREE men came face to face with angry people who punished them for terrorising residents of Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Sunday. They were found with machinery reportedly stolen from shops and a butchery in Thulamahashe. The angry mob tied up the half-naked men with chains and moered them until they surrendered the stolen items. Luckily, they were rescued by cops from being set alight with petrol. “This is a serious breakthrough,” said a resident. “These criminals confessed to terrorising residents and shop owners at night. “They surrendered items stolen from shops. We’re fed up with this senseless crime in the area. “They used to break in using knives and dangerous weapons, but we hunted them down and caught them hiding in Dwarsloop, Violet Bank, Arthurstone and Kumani. “We wanted to finish them off, but police protected them. Our lives are meaningless to these heartless criminals,” he said. On Thursday hundreds of angry residents braved the rain and marched to hand over a memorandum of grievances to Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma at Mhala Police Station. The residents have given him 14 days to respond to their memo. They accused Mhala cops of incompetence, corruption and working with criminals. Police spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane confirmed that three men were rescued from mob justice. Nyakane appealed to residents not to take the law into their own hands and to report crimes to the police.
