ETHEKWINI College in Asherville, Durban has until Friday to get its act together. The deadline was announced by National Student Financial Aid Scheme beneficiaries at a protest on Thursday. Student Representative Council president Anele Songelwa said about two weeks ago management promised to solve accommodation issues for NSFAS beneficiaries. “The college pays different amounts for accommodation to students,” she said. Those who live in the college residences get R2 400 every month for rent, while those who live in privately owned flats are only given R3 500 for three months. “This is not enough because living in a flat is expensive. We don’t know why they don’t give students the same amount of money,” said Songelwa. She said they had asked the college to increase the number of residences. “On top of that they have not paid the students their accommodation money, which resulted in some students being kicked out of their flats.” She said they didn’t blame the matter on NSFAS because the college told them the scheme had already deposited the money with the college. Principal Mkosinathi Mchunu said management was surprised by the protests. “We held a meeting with the student leaders on Wednesday and outlined how the accommodation funding is allocated. “ They seemed to understand very well. “We don’t know how they ended up protesting the following day,” he said. Mchunu said things went back to normal a day after the protests.
