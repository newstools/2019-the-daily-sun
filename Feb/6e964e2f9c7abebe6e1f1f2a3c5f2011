SANCO members, doctors and other medical staff gathered at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto yesterday to hand over a memorandum to management. Doctors downed tools for an hour to show they have had enough of the working conditions at the hospital. Dr Bandile Masuku, head of the ANC sub-committee on health in Gauteng, said they were aware of the crisis at Bara. “Bara is a national hospital and needs to be taken seriously. We’re here to acknowledge the problem and want the MEC to allocate a fair amount to this very important place,” he said. Also in support of the protest was Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng, who emphasised the importance of happy doctors in disadvantaged communities. He said:“The only people who suffer when doctors are unavailable are the poor. Doctors work under pressure and are short-staffed.” Sanco spokesman Simphiwe Hlafa said what was happening at the hospital was a disgrace. He said doctors were not only dealing with sick patients, but had to clean and be porters as well. “It is time authorities took issues raised by the doctors into consideration.” Phashe Magagane handed over the memorandum to hospital management and it was signed for by Thokozani Langa from the MEC’s office. He promised to give a response within seven days.
