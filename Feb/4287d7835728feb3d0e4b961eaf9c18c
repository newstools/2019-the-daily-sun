THOUSANDS of guests from all over Mzansi and its neighbours gathered for a sip of freshly harvested amarula on Saturday. They spent the day with the Tembe royal family in Mhlabuyalingana, northern KZN, to celebrate the ninth annual uMthayi Marula Festival, when the Tembe people pray and ask for new year blessings. Guests came from as far as Mozambique, Botswana and eSwatini. Local inkosi Mabhudu Tembe said the festival is very important for the Tembe tribe, and the growing attendance of people from other places made them realise they should open a factory to manufacture products using marula fruit. “This place is rich in marula trees, and the demand for this freshly brewed drink made us realise people love it. “We have started planning a factory. We want these products to benefit everyone and boost this rural area’s economy.” The chief said the factory would create opportunities for youth and women who can make different products with the fruit. Villager Evelina Tembe (53) said the fruit boosts one’s health. “If a factory would supply it throughout the province, people would become healthy.” Skhumba Khanyile (57) said: “It makes you live long, so if it was sold around the country, people would have a natural energy drink.” Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala said the project preserves culture and gives Tembe people something to identify with. “During this time, hotels and B&Bs are fully booked,” he said.
