IN 2008, a job fell into his lap while he was sitting outside the shops near Home Affairs. And 11 years later, Vuyo Sohe (42) is still fetching lunch for staff at the Bloemfontein Home Affairs office every day. Vuyo told Daily Sun he had become so close to the 55 people working at the offices that he even attended their families’ funerals. Staff even bought him a cellphone so they could reach him when they needed help. The SunTeam found out about Vuyo when staff filmed him calming a woman in a queue in December. When the SunTeam visited the offices on Tuesday at 7am, Vuyo was already there ready to make a list of things they needed him to pick up for them. Staff said they even started sending Vuyo to buy electricity and pay accounts. Vuyo said: “I arrive here at 6am and wait for everyone to arrive. “Staff love me and what I’m doing for them. It’s very important to be loyal to the people who trust you. I hope to some day be given a permanent job here.” Branch manager Elias Mbambo said all his staff loved Vuyo. “Personally, I don’t like sending other people to buy things for me but my staff love Vuyo for his honesty. He is a good man.”
