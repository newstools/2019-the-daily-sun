A NAKED man and his 4-5 brought traffic to a standstill on Wednesday. Some people laughed, others were shocked, while some scrambled to get their children out of the way on the main road in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane. The naked man, who seemed totally unaware of what was happening around him, gave one driver such a fright they ran over him! , caused traffic to come to a standstill on Wednesday when he walked around the main road in GaRankuwa, Tshwane. In a video taken by a motorist, the man appears to have injuries to his right leg and forehead. He walks to the camera and says: “Your taxi is beautiful, let me take a picture of you.” One driver got a fright and ran over him when he approached her car. When people told him to put on his clothes he chased them away. Lorna Motsepe (54) said she was shocked when she saw him taking his clothes off. “I didn’t know what was going on. “He just came from nowhere and stopped in the middle of the road,” she said. Some people in the area guessed that he might be a thug and that karma had caught up with him. “He looks like he’s gone mad,” said one man. “Maybe someone dealt with him because he must have been a normal person once.” Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said: “It is possible that he stole from someone who may have cursed him. “If his family doesn’t do something about it, then he will remain like that for the rest of his life. There were people who said they recognised him and that he was a big problem in their area and he may have looked for trouble with the wrong people. “Nothing he says makes any sense,” said a resident.
