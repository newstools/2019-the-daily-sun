RESIDENTS of East London held a peaceful protest on Saturday. They demanded that Buffalo City Municipality close East London Zoo, arguing that it was abusing animals. Eastern Cape legislature member Christian Martin said: “The zoo needs to think about the ongoing suffering of the animals, particularly the jaguar that is confined to a wire cage not much bigger than a suburban swimming pool. “The cage contains a slimy trench and a pole structure, but no trees for shade. “It is widely reported that the zoo has received numerous letters of concern regarding the conditions of the facility that houses these animals.” Martin said one of the bears recently had to be put down after becoming paralysed. Environmental Affairs MEC Oscar Mabuyane accepted their memorandum. “We are going to attend to this petition with the municipality. We will correct whatever wrongs are happening at the zoo,” said Mabuyane.
