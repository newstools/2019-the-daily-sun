A TRAFFIC cop who was caught on camera accepting a bribe has not only resigned but faces criminal charges. A video shows the on-duty cop accepting a number of bank notes from a truck driver in the Butterworth CBD on Thursday. But the officer resigned on Friday, 20 minutes after he was served with a suspension letter. Mnquma municipal manager Silumko Mahlasela said they have a strong policy against corruption, fraud and bribery. “It was hardly 20 minutes after we served the suspension letter that we received a signed letter of resignation with immediate effect from the cop,” said Mahlasela. “We have laid criminal charges against this culprit.” Eastern Cape Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana said the video was deeply concerning and praised the truck driver for reporting the matter.
