THE South African Police Service recently held three events in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga to raise funds for the children of police officers who died in the line of duty. The police have announced that through certain events – National Police Day, the official opening of KaMhlushwa Police Station and the National Commissioner’s Golf Challenge – they were able to raise about R2,6 million for the educational trust. According to a statement released by the police, this was made possible with pledges from individuals and businesses through the SAPS Educational Trust. The trust was established by the South African Police Service in 2010 to provide educational support to the children of police members. One of the beneficiaries is Andile Sithole (22), who is studying Business Management. The trust has been paying for his studies since 2016. He said: “My father was a fun and energetic person and I miss his laughter. I am grateful for the help I am receiving from the trust. I know that my father is proud of me.” Andile’s father, Detective-Sergeant Mfanafuthi Sitole, died in an accident while on duty in 2013. Andile’s younger brother, who is in grade 3, is also receiving assistance from the trust.
