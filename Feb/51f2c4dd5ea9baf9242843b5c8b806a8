The cops in Villa-nora outside Lephalale arrested 11 suspects
aged between 25 and 38 for public violence and malicious damage to property. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the arrest
follows a chain of events in Dipompong village where members of the community
embarked on violent protest actions by barricading the roads with stones,
various objects and subsequently burning two busses. The additional Public Order Police members were deployed to
the area to stabilize the situation. The arrested suspects will appear before the Phalala
Magistrate Court soon. More arrests are expected. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the South African
Police Service in Limpopo Major General Jan Scheepers has condemned this act of
violent protest with the strongest terms. "Members of the community are once more advised and
encouraged to follow the due legal processes whenever they are having
complaints against any entity rather than resorting to violent behavior which
will never be tolerated," said Scheepers.
