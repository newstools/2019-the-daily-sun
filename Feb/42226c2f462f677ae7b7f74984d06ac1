ON FRIDAY, the CRL Rights Commission called Sunward Park High School staff and Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi to Braamfontein, Joburg. Lesufi did not arrive. This happened after Bongiwe Ngobese claimed teachers victimised her because of an ancestral calling. Her parents said she was told by school staff that demons had possessed her and she would affect other pupils if she returned to school after going to thwasa. She went to the principal’s office to hand over a letter from her parents for permission to wear her sangoma beads. Last month, the education department said the school allowed Bongiwe to wear her beads if they were covered . The school said it was trying to protect her from being victimised. The commission also heard that in 2017, Bongiwe was allegedly made to drink anointing oil by a teacher, who also is a pastor, to get rid of her demons and this made her sick. Deputy principal Enoch Thango said when he told staff about Bongiwe’s situation, they said they were scared. “The principal did not call Bongiwe a demon, as reported. “I treated her like my child.” Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said: “You allowed a teacher to practise his religion on Bongiwe but didn’t allow the beads. There was no time frame for how long she had to cover them.”
