RESIDENTS claim they are living like animals while their ward councillor ignores them. This is after a family shack burnt down in Dacawa squatter camp outside East London on Wednesday. Phila Mali (58), an unemployed mother of three who lost everything when her shack burnt down, said: “I have no place to go. That place has been my home since 1994.” She said their ward 12 councillor Gwebile Gosani did not even come to check on them. But she said this was no surprise. According to the residents, the cause of the fire was not known, but illegal electricity connections can’t be ruled out. “Our lives are at risk here. We have no food, no clothes and our IDs are gone. I am pleading for donations from anyone who can help,” said Phila. Dacawa housing project steering member said: “The housing general plan was approved by the Buffalo City council in September 2015 but still there are no houses. Our councillor is failing us. We are not going to vote this year.” Gosani said the housing delay is the fault of the contractor appointed by the municipality. “I always follow up with the municipality. They said the contractor was expected to arrive at the site soon. “At least 161 houses will be built. Efforts to provide the family with a temporary structure are at an advanced stage,” he said.
