Mzansi people have taken to social media to voice their
concern about the state the country is currently in. This comes after the brutal murder of 27-year-old Thoriso
Themane by five pupils in Flora Park
in Polokwane. The five school boys have been arrested after hundreds of
people called for the pupils to be brought to book. In the video that went viral on social media, one of the
boys could be heard saying his father was a top cop and that nothing was going
to happen to him. However, the boy is part of the five suspects that were arrested
on Wednesday.
