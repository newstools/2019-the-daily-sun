DJ Cleo on Saturday had a reunion with his pal and protégé
Brickz. Cleo’s visit to the prison was part of a prison soccer match
which was hosted by the Humanitarian Empowerment Fund at Krugersdorp prison. Brickz, real name Sipho Ndlovu is serving a 15-year sentence
for rape at the prison. Cleo shared pictures of his reunion on Twitter with the
caption “We all run our own races, he fell along the way....but the race is not
over” But social media was not having it. They slammed Cleo for
being insensitive. Boity was one of the celebrities that came for Cleo
twitting: “What’s wrong with you, @djcleo1?????” She later followed the tweet
saying “To all the psychopaths in my mentions defending Cleo/Bricks, you can go
jump off the highest cliff. Until some evil cunt rapes your little sister (or
some1 u love) you will continue being a raggedy ass rape apologist because you
don’t give a flying fuck about the victim!! Tsek!”
