Midrand residents helped themselves with MAQ washing powder. This is after a Cargo truck was looted on the N1
Olifantsfontein, Midrand. Those who were nearby did not hesitate; they decided to help
themselves with the cargo in the truck. Some where even happy saying that things are expensive in
this country and God is just blessing them. “I hope someone checked if the driver is okay at least but
other than that, I see no problem,” Kediboni tweeted. However some were disgusted by people’s behavior. “This is sad indeed! I won’t be surprised if no one checked
if anyone is injured. Our black brothers and sisters have stooped to the lowest
level. It’s a Shame,” John Modise tweeted. “What would have happened if this was beer, really we have
no respect for other people’s possessions in this country. Hope that washing
power can wash the guilt right out of your souls,” Bakteen8 tweeted.
