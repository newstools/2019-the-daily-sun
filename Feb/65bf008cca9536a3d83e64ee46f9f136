THE suspected murderer of two matric pupils briefly appeared in the Cofimvaba Magistrates Court yesterday. Sakhumzi Sibhuqashe (27) faces two counts of murder after he allegedly stabbed two school girls to death in Ncuncuzo Village on Thursday night. The suspect asked to apply for a state lawyer and the case was postponed to Thursday. It’s alleged Sibhuqashe forced his way into a room his girlfriend, Zikhona Mayile (18), and her friend Anda Beja, were renting. Both girls were pupils at Ncuncuzo Senior Secondary School. Zikhona was allegedly stabbed by Sibhuqashe during an argument. Anda was stabbed while trying to intervene and died later. On Sunday, school principal Luvuyo Maseti led a delegation of teachers and SGB members to visit the victims’ families. “The whole school is saddened by the tragic death of these two girls. It will take a long time for all of us to bury the pain,” he said. Maseti said a memorial service would be held for the girls at the school on Thursday. They will be buried in their home villages over the weekend. Anda will be laid to rest in Camama Village on Saturday and Zikhona will be buried in Upper Ncuncuzo Village on Sunday.
