RESIDENTS were engaged in a fierce battle with a blazing fire. But they lost the fight and the blaze destroyed everything in a burning shack, leaving the owner with nothing. “The fire destroyed my four-roomed shack,” said Mathlomula Mabunda (38) from Marikana in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane. He told Daily Sun he was busy with construction work when a child told him his shack was on fire. “When I got there it was too late to save anything. I lost everything I worked hard for. “We don’t know the cause of the fire, but we suspect it was a paraffin stove or an electrical fault.” The father of six said he lost three fridges, furniture, clothes, R600, his ID and his late father’s death certificate. Mathlomula said his children were at school at the time of the fire and, luckily, no one was injured. His brother Tshepo Khumalo (24) said it was sad to lose everything. “The community worked hard to put out the fire, but it was too powerful,” he said. “There was a huge cloud of dark smoke coming out of the shack as the community used buckets of water to extinguish the fire.” Mathlomula said no authorities came to the scene.
