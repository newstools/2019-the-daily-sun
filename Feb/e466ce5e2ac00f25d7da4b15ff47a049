THE men dress to kill and look trustworthy but are apparently up to no good. Cops in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, have warned people to be wary of three men running a bogus investment scheme. Captain Jethro Mtshali told Daily Sun: “Help us find them.They lure people into believing they will double or triple their cash.” Mtshali said the thugs had an office in the Kempton Park CBD. People invested R30 000, and some even up to R100 000.” He said once the victims handed over their money for investment, the men disappeared. Lungelo Makhathini (29) told the SunTeam: “My small amount was doubled, but when I invested more they disappeared.” Mtshali asked people with information to call the police, or 08600 10111.
