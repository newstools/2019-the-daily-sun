NO, you can’t bribe us – and by the way you’re under arrest! This was the answer when a man offered JMPD cops a R4 800 bribe. Not only did they turn down the bribe, they also offered the man a pair of handcuffs. JMPD spokesman, Superintend Wayne Minaar told Daily Sun the officers arrested the man on Wednesday in Lenasia, south of Joburg. “The officers had received a tip-off about a warehouse where counterfeit goods were being kept,” said Minnaar. He said the man stocked the fake goods, mostly branded shoes, valued at R100 000 and sold them to street vendors. He said members of staff will be sent to hot spots to help alleviate traffic congestion. “Motorists must be patient at intersections where there are no police and to treat such intersections as four-way stops.” Chief Tembe’s plan has been approved by the City. All points should be covered by 6am every day. Motorists loved the news. “We’ve been struggling on the roads,” said Phumlani Mzobe from Meadowlands zone 4, Soweto. “It’s a mess, but we are glad the chief is thinking for us.” Lindokuhle Mbatha (30) said: “Because of the traffic I’ve been late at work. I’m happy the JMPD is helping us.”
