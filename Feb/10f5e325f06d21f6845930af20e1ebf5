 Is this the end for Clarkson’s favourite hairdresser car? Mercedes-Benz has unveiled a special edition of its smallest
roadster, the SLC. The Final Edition SLC is the last hoorah to the current
generation SLC. The SLK, as the SLC range was formerly launched in 1996. With the launch of
SLK, Mercedes-Benz produced a roadster whose fixed vario-roof redefined the
roadster segment by combining open-air driving pleasure with uncompromised
comfort in poor weather - that had never been available before or at least
that’s what they say. The SLK was a success even former Top Gear host Jeremy
Clarkson owned one, a 2005 SLK AMG 55. The SLK was launched in Yellowstone, yellow. The car will now
be exclusively offered on the SLC Final Edition. You can have your Final Edition in either SLC 180, SLC 200,
SLC 300 and the powerful SLC AMG 43. The Final Edition is based on the AMG line trim. That gets
you AMG Styling bumpers at the front and rear, a sports suspension with 10 mm
lowering, and bigger brakes with perforated calipers with the Mercedes-Benz
logo. The Final Edition adds in SLC Final Edition badge on the
front wings, below the chromed fin and standard-fit 5-spoke AMG light-alloy
wheels with a high-gloss black finish. Inside there are a plethora of options including, two-tone
nappa leather in black/silver pearl with alpaca grey topstitching. There’s also
Carbon-fibre look leather inserts in the head restraints and the upper section
of the seat-backs.
