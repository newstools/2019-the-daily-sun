THE killer high-mast light which claimed the lives of five kids in Soshanguve block X, Tshwane, has finally been removed! Its removal last Friday came after residents put pressure on outgoing mayor Solly Msimanga to get rid of it. Ward 25 councillor Phumzile Hlatshwayo said: “The symbol of our children’s deaths has finally been removed, thanks to more than 5 000 residents who signed a petition. “We’re happy with the removal because families still need closure.” The Bopape family, who live next to the light, welcomed the removal of the high-mast light. They lost two kids aged 11 and five. The kids’ gogo, Suzan, said it was traumatising to look at the structure every day. “We hope we will find peaceful closure in this matter because it reminded us of death every time we looked at it,” she told Daily Sun. Kearabile Baloyi (12), Boitsoko (11), Maikano Mmenu (9), Lethabo Matibako (9) and Dimpho (5) died about a year ago when the light fell on them. The kids were playing on the concrete slabs beneath the structure. Another child later died at Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa. Two of the kids survived and another sustained severe injuries.
