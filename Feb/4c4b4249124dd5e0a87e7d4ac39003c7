Residents of Mandela Park in Ga-Kgapane, Bolobedu, said they were being robbed of their right to basic services. Residents in Limpopo told Daily Sun they had been without clean running water since they moved to the area more than 15 years ago. Community leader Lawrence Lebea (49) said: “We have never seen a water tanker from the municipality so we are forced to get water from a well. The well is a health hazard as there are some people who dump their rubbish, including used nappies, in the dam which supplies water to the well. We also share the water with livestock.” Lebea said they felt as if they didn’t exist. “All we want is the basic service delivery to which we’re entitled. “Maybe the municipality is waiting for someone to get sick and die from drinking the dirty water before action is taken. “They have forgotten about us but they will be going up and down in our area soon because the election is coming close. “Then they will disappear again.” More than 300 households in the area depend on the well for water. Residents said they had lost faith in the ward councillor. DA councillor Timothy Maluleke said they municipality does not take care of its people. “People of Mandela Park have been without clean water for far too long and it’s enough now,” he said. Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Maenetje said they are attending to the issues at Mandela Park.
