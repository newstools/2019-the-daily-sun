A PREGNANT woman wants justice after she was allegedly beaten by three women when she demanded her cellphone back. Nkosingiphile Ngcobo (34) from Mandeni, KZN said in December, she lent her neighbour her phone. Nkosingiphile said she realised the woman wasn’t bringing it back and on 14 January she went to ask for it. “She told me I would never get it back. When I asked why, she didn’t give me any answers. “Then her mum and cousin started beating me with fists and stones. At that time, I was three months pregnant. Fortunately, my sister was passing by and helped me. She took me to see a doctor and then we went to a open a case against them.” She said she was sure they would pay for what they did but until today they are still walking the streets freely. “I went to question the investigating officer and he told me he has lots of cases and I have to wait. Weeks went by with no progress. “Whenever these women see me they tell me they paid lots of money for it not to progress.” Nkosingiphile said she learnt the cop was related to them. “Last Friday, I went to the station commander and he called the cop to explain, who he told us he was going on leave so he’d deal with it in March. I want the station to change the cop,” she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case was opened at Mandeni cop shop and she would check the allegations about the cop.
