On Monday morning police noticed a white Audi A7 which was
hijacked last week in Kempton Park. The police gave chase to the car until the R25 near
Kaalfontein Railway Station in Kempton Park. According to the police, the suspects opened fire against them,
and then the police returned fire fatally wounding all three suspects. Police recovered an R-5 rifle and 9mm pistol which were both
loaded on the scene. All the members of the SAPS K9, Hawks Organised Crime, the
Saturation Unit of Gauteng Traffic Police and Tracker were unharmed. A woman, who the suspectâ€™s car collided into, was rushed to a
nearby hospital. Police Spokesperson Brigadier Mathepelo Peters said the joint
intelligence-driven operation was an emphasis of the seriousness of the police
in their zero-tolerance-approach to serious and violent crime. Peters said that the possibility of the suspects being
involved in other crimes could not be ruled out.
