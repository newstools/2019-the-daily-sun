RESIDENTS of a new squatter camp destroyed about 18 unoccupied shacks on Tuesday. They told Daily Sun they did it because the owners of the shacks had houses already. Residents of Monna-ha-Latwe in Mangaung said the empty shacks were being used as hiding places for stolen items. A resident said the shack owners were greedy and were not thinking of the needy. “There are many shacks in this area that are not occupied. Today, we decided to destroy all those shacks. The owners have places to stay and some even have RDP houses,” he said. “Their plan is to wait for this area to be developed and then they will show up and claim the yards. “Some have even sent people to guard the shacks for money. “These poor guards will be chased away when the place is developed. This is pure exploitation and we’re gatvol of that. Many of our people need a place to call their own as they are renting.” Mathabo Merahe (37) said: “We want to live in peace here. I am glad the community decided to stand up and fight corruption.” Councillor Hoes Ramabodu said he was aware of the destruction of shacks and said it was criminal. “I explained to them that the municipality will deal with the matter. People took advantage and we have been trying to stop that,” he said.
