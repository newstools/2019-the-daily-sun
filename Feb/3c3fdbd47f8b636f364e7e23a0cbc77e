COMMUNITY activist Pamela Mabini has a big heart. The 38-year-old from Kwazakhele, Nelson Mandela Bay, brought a smile to homeless people in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. The founder of Maro organisation didn’t only give the homeless bread and polony. She also handed out pads to women who roam the streets at St George’s Park. Pamela said: “I started helping homeless people in 2014. I used to donate blankets and clothes because it pains me to see other people suffering. I know the pain of being poor. “That’s why I often share the little I have with the less fortunate because we may think that we are poor, but there are people who don’t have anything at all. “I’ve also helped poor pupils and have donated things to different NGOs and hospices. Helping the vulnerable will always have a special place in my heart. “I always find joy when I give to others the little I have to make a small difference to their lives.” Clive Loops (67) has lived on the streets for 20 years. He said: “It’s good to see that there are people who care about us. I’m grateful to Pamela for helping us. I hope other people will follow in her footsteps”
