FOR years Celia Miggels has paid for her electricity, but now she’s taken the fall for izinyoka. The 57-year-old from Eersterust, Tshwane, told Daily Sun she never connected it illegally but her power was cut off. Her meter started rejecting new tokens in September. “I’d buy electricity and it would not load, but I was surprised because my power never ran out,” she said. Celia said as a law-abiding citizen, she reported it to the municipality. “Officials came and found that someone had made illegal connections, which I was affected by. I thought the person would be charged and I was relieved,” she said. Celia said she was shocked when she was told she owed the city R20 000 and her electricity was cut off. “I was fuming. Is this how the municipality thanks whistleblowers? If I knew I’d be treated like this, I wouldn’t have reported it.” Celia said she couldn’t pay the R20 000 as she’s unemployed. “They know I’m poor because I’m on the indigent list and can’t sue for spoilt food and the trauma of being in the dark. “I think they’re doing this because I’m a poor black woman.” Daily Sun called the city, which requested Celia’s meter number and address, but it has not responded after the inquiry was sent a week ago.
