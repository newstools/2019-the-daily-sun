INDUNA Jabulani Ngwenya’s family says his murder and those of other villagers is linked to a false case. Relatives of the 54-year-old from Maqeleni Village, Eshowe told Daily Sun Jabulanisurvived other attacks last year but his luck ran out in December. They said they gave local cops information they thought would lead to arrests but were ignored. They want Police Minister Bheki Cele to intervene. A relative said: “After he was accused of stealing livestock, Jabulani was called to a traditional court but an induna was told to apologise for falsely accusing him.” The relative said the five village men killed in the past two months were on good terms with Jabulani. After Sibusiso Ndlovu (28) was killed on Thursday, a relative said there was a rumour that there was a hit list. Cele’s spokeswoman Reneilwe Serero advised the family to write to his office to explain the action they needed. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case was being investigated. “If you have information, call your nearest cop shop or 08600 10111.”
