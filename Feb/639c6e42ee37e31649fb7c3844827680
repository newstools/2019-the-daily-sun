FROM outside, the two-roomed mud house looks like any other someone from a poor background would live in. But inside, it is a makeshift factory which a group of eight women from Noqhekwana Village, Port St Johns, use to make fresh jam. The women, aged between 44 and 60, started making jam in 2006. So far, they only sell it in villages. But their ultimate goal is to have it sold in major supermarkets across the country. Proud Nofungile Mxinwa said they used to plant fruit trees just to enjoy the raw fruits. “We later received training from the Agricultural Research Council. That’s how Noqhekwana Jam Making Project was founded.” They produce orange, tomato, banana and pawpaw jam. Each member plants fruit in their garden and brings the produce to the project. They sell each 250ml jar of jam for R20.
