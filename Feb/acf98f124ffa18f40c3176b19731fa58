THE Municipal Demarcation Board is hosting a conference tomorrow at the Birchwood Hotel in Ekurhuleni to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Board chairwoman Jane Thupana said they will reflect on their journey so far. She said the board has made strides in reversing apartheid’s urban planning and creating boundaries that don’t separate people by race or class. She said the aim of the conference was to give players in local government an opportunity to discuss policy issues. “The conference will be attended by more than 450 people from municipalities, politics, government and other institutions. “There will also be MECs, academics, international experts and political party representatives,” she said.
