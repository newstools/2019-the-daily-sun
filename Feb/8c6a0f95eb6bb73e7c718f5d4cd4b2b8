WHEN the cops arrived at the scene after the brutal killing of two suspects by an angry crowd on Thursday night, villagers suspected councillor Bakery Ledwaba had called the police. The 46-year-old from Boetse Village in Mashashane, Limpopo, said he and his family lived in fear. He told Daily Sun after the brutal attack a group of villagers arrived at his house looking for him. Bakery claimed that a cop told the group he had called the police to save the suspects’ lives. He said he was being threatened by fellow villagers, who accused him of selling them out to the police after they allegedly beat two suspects to death. “The suspects were accused of burglaries that happened at local schools last Monday. Several computers were stolen at the schools.” Bakery said the two suspects were hunted down and found in Polokwane. They were brought back to the village. “As a councillor, I can’t allow crime to continue in the village but when we catch the suspects, the police should be called. “It’s dangerous if police lie and reveal the names of their sources,” he said. After the brutal killing, the angry villagers wanted to turn on people who sell nyaope in the village. But cops were already in the area to calm the situation. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said cops were investigating the councillor’s complaint. “We’re investigating this matter and the cluster commander is on top of it. “We will definitely find out what happened and give our feedback,” Ngoepe told the People’s Paper.
