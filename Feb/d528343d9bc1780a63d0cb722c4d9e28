KANEGO Malele is a worried man. They 40-year-old from Castel in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, lives in a crumbling house that may collapse at any time. Kanego told Daily Sun that since his mum died, he has been living in a crumbling house and is worried that something bad might happen to him while he’s asleep. He is mentally ill and depends on his social grant to survive. Kanego has pleaded with the human settlements department to build him a proper house. “I don’t even know where to start if I want to apply for an RDP but I hope housing officials will help me get a house.” Human settlements spokesman Freddy Ngobe referred the SunTeam to Bushbuckridge Municipality. Municipal spokesman Aubrey Mnisi said the councillor has been informed about the matter. “The people responsible for handling such cases will see how they can help Kanego.”
