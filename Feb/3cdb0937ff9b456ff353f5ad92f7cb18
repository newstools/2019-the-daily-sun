THE PowerBall jackpot rolled over three times without a winner. It totalled R232 million, the highest jackpot in the history of the South African lottery. One lucky winner from the Western Cape scooped the jackpot! Whoever they are, they’ve just joined a list of Mzansi’s multi-millionaires. SunReaders gave the new millionaire tips on how to spend the money. Mandla Mnisi said: “Do what your heart tells you. Enjoy your money, it’s yours.” Nonhle said: “Enjoy it, but make sure you never go back to poverty. By that I mean invest and make sure there’s more coming in than just spending and spending.” However, other comments were less serious. Ziningi Mzizi said: “Just lobola me with all of it. It’s safer that way. Just kidding, invest in property.” Shuki April said: “Give loans to Eskom, Bosasa etc.” Siyabonga Sihoyo wrote: “Buy Kaizer Chiefs and sign quality players.” Mpumi Matiwane said the winner could afford to give Mzansi citizens a million each. “Sharing is caring,” she said. Maxe Khothakome said: “Kumele udle ama slay queen, uthenge iflat, uthenge ne Rolls-Royce bese udlala enye ilotto coz imali ibiza enye. (You should eat slay queens, buy a flat and a Rolls-Royce, then play lotto again because money goes where there’s money). Ithuba released a statement congratulating the winner.
