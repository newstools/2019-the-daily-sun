PEOPLE in red EFF overalls came to church yesterday to receive blessings from Prophet Paseko Mboro. The EFF Student Command, led by national spokesman Mangaliso Sambo, descended on Mboro’s Incredible Happenings Ministries in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, ahead of a national campaign against colleges that abuse young people. “Close to a million students are stuck at home after completing courses at bogus colleges,” said Sambo. “These colleges abuse desperate students and parents by advertising and operating bogus colleges that put money first.” Sambo said they visited Mboro’s church to spread the gospel of shutting down bogus colleges and to warn parents about sending their kids to these institutions. On Tuesday the Student Command and Mboro took on iCollege at its campus in Newtown. They accompanied unhappy students who said they had been waiting to graduate since 2015. Some of the students who had applied for a scholarship fund only found out on Tuesday that the contract was actually an employment contract. Mboro said it was fitting for the Student Command to start at his church. He said when the EFF was still coming up, its leaders, including Julius Malema and spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, also came to his church for prayers.
