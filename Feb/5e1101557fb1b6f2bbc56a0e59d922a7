ZANEKHAYA Mthi (52) from Delft, Cape Town is unhappy about the way cops treated him after the death of his son last month. His son Thembalethu (29) was hit by a car on the R300 near Delft on 26 January. He died on the spot but Zanekhaya does not know the identity of the person responsible for his death. “Cops are protecting the man. They say I may harm him but that’s not the case,” he said. “All I want is to see the face of the person who killed my son so I can find closure.” Zanekhaya said every time he asked about the progress of the case, he’s told that the person has already appeared in court and cops are handling the matter. “I’ve never seen the face of the person who killed my son. “I’d like to know the court in which he appeared so I can follow the proceedings and see if justice is really taking place.” Thembalethu was buried in Lady Frere, Eastern Cape on Saturday. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said the case has not gone to court. “The case is still open for investigation. According to the investigating officer, he is in contact with the complainant and no suspect has appeared. “The docket is still with the court until a final decision is made,” said Van Wyk.
