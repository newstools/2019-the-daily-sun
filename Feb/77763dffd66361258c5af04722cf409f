A MAN apparently handed himself over to cops on Tuesday in connection to a hit and run. This is after the body of an unknown man was discovered with its head missing on Saturday. It’s believed the 39-year-old suspect felt guilty about the incident and approached the police in Hartswater, Northern Cape. After the body was found, cops were called to the scene and found the victim was an unknown man who had been hit by a speeding car. Cops had been looking for the head since Sunday and found it in a nearby canal on Tuesday. Police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock said: “We are investigating a case of culpable homicide after a male driver handed himself over. The incident took place at around 9.30pm, 10km outside of Hartswater. “It’s believed the unknown male pedestrian’s head came off in the collision. “Since information surrounding the accident is still sketchy, police are requesting that anyone with information to contact Hartswater station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Sereetsi at 082 494 4212.” Kock said the suspect would appear in the Hartswater Magistrates Court soon.
