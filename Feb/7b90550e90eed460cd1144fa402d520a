WHILE many people only think of themselves in an emergency, Nkanyiso Xaba risked his life to save others. The 30-year-old security guard pulled 19 bedridden patients from a burning ward at Umphumulo Hospital in Maphumulo, northern KZN, on Tuesday. A fire apparently started in one of the wards and when Nkanyiso noticed it, he jumped through a window to save a nurse and patients trapped in the TB ward. It’s believed the fire was started by a patient in the psychiatric seclusion ward. Nkanyiso said earlier he had searched the patient to make sure he had no dangerous items on him. But a while later, Nkanyiso noticed smoke coming from a ward. “I noticed the fire was spreading from the seclusion ward to the male general and TB wards. “I pulled out those who couldn’t walk on their own and told the others to leave. I then went in through a back window to rescue a nursing assistant helping a patient. With the help of colleagues, the door was forced open and they could get out.” Nkanyiso said he didn’t know how he was able to rescue so many patients as everything happened really fast. “When I pulled the last patient out of bed, there was too much smoke and I collapsed.” Nkanyiso was rushed to the casualty ward before being transferred to Stanger Hospital. “I’m proud of what I did. I would not hesitate to do it again.” KZN Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo praised Nkanyiso for his bravery.
