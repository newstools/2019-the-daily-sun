MORE than 50 people were held hostage at Kwa Mai Mai in Joburg on Monday. According to the police, the ugly fight was over a community hall. It is understood the hall caused a division among residents living at Kwa Mai Mai. It is used for activities including meetings and shows. It is understood residents only realised the door was locked after the meeting. They were locked in all afternoon, moving from one corner to another, while others remained seated until cops arrived. Kwa Mai Mai is known as Joburg’s oldest traditional herbal medicine market. It is dominated by traditional healers who also sell traditional attire and meals, but it’s also home to many, including children. Captain Richard Munyayi said: “Cops found angry residents locked inside the hall. It’s understood two groups of residents are fighting over a community hall. “Cops were able to calm the situation as soon as the hall was opened. No one was harmed and no arrests were made as none of the residents laid a formal complaint.”
