A corrupt traffic cop from the Mnquma Local
Municipality has been suspended, after a video of him taking a bribe went
viral. The traffic official allegedly took the bribe from a truck
driver on the N2 in Butterworth. In the video, the traffic cop can be seen walking towards an
orange Polo Vivo. When he gets to the back of the car, he speaks with the
alleged truck driver - shortly after that he takes money from him. The traffic cop can be heard asking the driver where he took
the money, and then the driver replies and says I had it in the truck. The Eastern Cape Transport, Safety and Liaison MEC Weziwe
Tikana, said called on the municipality to take action against the officer. He also said, the traffic copâ€™s actions did go against
everything his department stands for.
