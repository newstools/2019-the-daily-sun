BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic’s lethal scorpion, Tshegofatso Mabaso, refuses to be put under pressure to compete for the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot Award. The on-form Mabaso netted a fine brace when Siwelele drew 2-2 against struggling Baroka FC in their Absa Premiership encounter at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. The 22-year-old star is now the PSL’s joint top scorer on eight goals with Mwape Musonda of Black Leopards. “It’s a nice feeling as a striker to score goals,” said the Botshabelo born player, who was also voted Man of the Match against the poor Bakgaga. “But I don’t want to put pressure on myself by fighting to end the season as leading scorer. I have set myself a goal of scoring goals and help the team win games. All I want is to keep working hard and score goals.” Even his caretaker coach, Lehlohonolo Seema, does not want to put pressure on Mabaso. “It’s good to see him score as it helps boost his confidence,” explained Seema. “We’re not going to put pressure on him. All we will do is to work with him and help him enjoy playing football.” Talking about their draw against Baroka, Mabaso said: “A point away is better than nothing.” Even Seema shared the same sentiment: “These are tough times in the PSL. Teams are fighting for the championship, top eight and to avoid relegation. So all the games, this time of the season, are extremely tough. You should be happy to get a point away.” The Free State side are fifth on the log with 29 points.
