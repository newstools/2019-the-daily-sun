ILLEGAL dumping remains a huge challenge for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. Mayor Mongameli Bobani said the municipality was committed to tackling illegal dumping. He said those found guilty of illegal dumping would be fined R2 000. “The municipality will appoint co-operatives to clean the municipality, and bring back the War on Waste campaign,” said Bobani. “Illegal dumping has been a problem for years and it has got worse in recent months because of poor budgeting. “But now we will put aside money to clean our city.” Bobani asked members of the community to keep their kasis clean. “Residents have the right to live in a clean, safe environment. “Communities must take responsibility for their environment. “We can only enforce our by-laws if residents assist us by reporting the culprits,” said Bobani. “The municipality spends millions of rands cleaning up these illegal dumps. That money could have been used to provide basic services. “We have a problem with businesses which don’t want to pay for refuse collection. But we will go after them.”
