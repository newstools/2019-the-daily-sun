BISHOP Elly Mogodiri yesterday joined the long list of people who want Pastor Alph Lukau to face the law. Mogodiri, leader of St Oak Global Church of Christ, on Tuesday opened criminal cases at Hartebeestpoort cop shop, near Brits in the North West. The bishopâ€™s action came after three funeral parlours, including Kings and Queens Funeral Services, laid charges against Alleluia International Ministries for claiming to have resurrected a dead man. Lukau made headlines this week after a video of him, supposedly raising a man from the dead, went viral on social media. Mogodiri said he opened organised crime, fraud and misrepresentation cases. He said he did this to prevent what he called false prophets from abusing the church. The parlour in whose vehicle Lukau transported the supposedly dead man said they were tricked.
