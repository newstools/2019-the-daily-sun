FANS knew him as a funny man but his friends and fellow comedians knew his dark side. This came out during comedian Sbusiso “Ankel” Shangase’s funeral at KwaMakhutha in Durban on Saturday. Ankel died last week after a long illness. His close friend Dlungelwa said although Ankel was rude, he was quick to forgive and forget. “He would be rude and then call you the next day. When you reminded him what he’d said to you, he would tell you to forget about it. My friend loved money and was quick to get upset but he was quick to forgive.” Comedian Mondli Mzizi said: “We once gossiped about Simphiwe Shembe with other comedians and when Simphiwe arrived, Ankel told him we’d gossiped about him and didn’t love him. “We were so shocked but we loved him despite his attitude. “Ankel did a lot of things, good and bad. He once stole my joke and used it in his video. He laughed and told me I would never use it again because it belonged to him.” Comedian Pastor Mjosty said people thought he didn’t get along with Ankel. “It’s just that we couldn’t work together. He once called me, saying we must learn to work together as comedians. “But a few minutes later, he called again and said ngingamjwayeli kabi (I mustn’t take him for granted) if I wanted to work with him. But I loved him as he was.” There were jokes and laughter at the funeral organised by the KZN Creative Industry Forum. Joy Mbewana said Ankel was ready to die.
