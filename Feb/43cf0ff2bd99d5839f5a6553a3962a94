The Senior leader of Rhema Bible Church, Pastor Ray McCauley
said religious leaders have taken too long to respond to the misconduct
witnessed in some churches. McCauley said these practices have tarnished the reputation
of churches. He was speaking during the Religious Summit held in Rhema
Bible Church in Randburg on Wednesday. Religious leaders and Academics gathered to find principles
of good governance for Religious Bodies, in ensuring that leaders are being
held to account to the society and the religious leaders for misconduct. The summit follows a number of incidents which emerged
relating to the abuse of the religious system. These include pastors feeding members
of the congregation animals while others are facing string of charges including
rape. The Summit is with the assistance of the CRL Rights
Commission. McCauley said: "The finding of the Commission has
embarrassed me. We are making headlines for all the wrong reasons. All these
have tarnished churches and put us in a bad light. "We have taken too long to speak and taken too long to
respond. We need to come up with a plan that will mitigate all the abuse. We
can find unity in the midst of diversity. We hope we can find a commonly ground
to move forward," said McCauley. Bishop Mosa Sono of Grace Bible Church said the summit
needed to find a groundbreaking solution to put an end to the malpractice
within the religious sector. He said: "The abuse, malpractice and the
misinterpretation have put the religious into disrepute. We are sad to say a
handful of people are messing up the great work the churches have done."
