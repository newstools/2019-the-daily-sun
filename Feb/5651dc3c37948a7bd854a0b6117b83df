A caption of her tweet has made a fan think that she
referred to herself as DJ Sumbody’s partner. She posted a photo of her in a
blue suit and the caption was “Somebody’s Body”. She has been hinting that she in a relationship for a while
now but never posted her man on any of her social media platforms and now her
followers are speculating that she might be with Monate Mpolaye hitmaker DJ
Sumbody.  The award winning presenter wants people to relax because she
won’t be posting her man. If there is a famous person who has managed to keep people
guessing when it comes to who they are dating it has to be Metro FM DJ Lerato
Kganyago. People will wait long enough before they get to see her man because
it won’t change anything in this country.
