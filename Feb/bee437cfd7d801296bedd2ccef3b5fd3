A YOUNG couple have finally celebrated their dream wedding. Newlyweds Tshepiso (30) and Lindiwe (27) Makhootse are the latest winners of the Boxer Win a Wedding Competition. The couple had their beautiful wedding at Balmoral Estates in De Deur in Vereeniging, Vaal, on Saturday. Friends and family gathered to witness the couple exchange their vows. Tshepiso and Lindiwe are unemployed and live in Tshepisong, west of Joburg. They met in 2016, and it was love at first sight. Eleven days later, Tshepiso went down on one knee and proposed to Lindiwe, and lobola was paid. They have a one-year-old son. The wedding had everything the couple desired from the decor to their wedding rings. An emotional Lindiwe shared how she never thought she would one day get married. Tshepiso vowed to love her unconditionally. Sharing their story during the interview with the judges prior to being selected as winners, they said they had always dreamt of a white wedding. However, after Tshepiso lost his job things got a little tough. The competition has been running since 2013. It has given seven couples their dream weddings at the cost of R100 000 each. Interested participants can buy any beauty product in store and send their entry. According to their interview, they have always dreamt of a white wedding, to have an unforgettable experience of laughter and pure joy. Winners are announced towards the end of each year. Marketing director Andrew Mills said: “We receive many entrants each year, but we look at the chemistry and the unconditional love. To this day, our previous winners are still married.”
