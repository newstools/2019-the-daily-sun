THE struggle for a matric certificate never ends for Samkelo Mbele (35) from site C, in Khayelitsha. He wrote his matric for the first time in 2006 but had to rewrite in 2013 and 2017 to pass. When he submitted a request for his matric certificate he was told the process takes only 10 weeks. Samkelo was over the moon when he received his certificate last week. But his happiness was shortlived, because his name was spelt incorrectly. “For the past two years I have been trying to get a certificate. When I thought I finally had it, another problem came up,” said Samkelo. He told the SunTeam he returned the certificate to the department of education the same day. “I couldn’t keep it because my middle name is Christoph but Christopher was written on the certificate.” Samkelo was recently invited to a job interview but wondered whether he would get the job without a proper matric certificate. Education spokeswoman Bronagh Hammond said: “The client contacted our certification unit and they are in the process of requesting a re-issue. He was informed that the re-issue of a certificate could take up to three months, as it is a legal change to a candidate’s personal details.”
