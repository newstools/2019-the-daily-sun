Wits secured a place in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinal draw in Joburg on Thursday
following a 3-2 win on penalties over Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium, in
Venda today. This was after the teams drew 1-1 at full-time. Wits
keeper Ricardo Goss was the hero as he denied Walter Munyai, Karabo Tshepe and
Lesedi Kapinga the chance  to score from the spot, while Robyn Johannes,
Elias Pelembe and Keagan Ritchie converted their penalties to the relief of
coach Gavin Hunt. Wits
striker Gift Motupa  silenced the vocal Leopards fans in the 35th minute
when  he broke the deadlock with a low shot from inside the penalty box
following a terrific cross from Pelembe. However, Leopards top goal scorer
Mwape Musonda cancelled Motupa's lead with a great header in the 80th minute to
force the game into extra time. The
clash was rescheduled after last week's match was abandoned in the first half
due to heavy rain with Leopards leading 1-0 via Kapinga's 37th minute goal.
However, the match was started from scratch with Lidoda Duvha losing their
advantage. Wits
were favorites to progress further having beaten Leopards 1-0 in a league game
at the same venue in December last year.  The Clever Boys aim to win the
league and cup double since they are  leading the pack in the Absa Premiership
with three points ahead of second placed Mamelodi Sundowns  on 37 points
from 20 matches. On
the other hand, Leopards were hoping to repeat the performances that saw them
 reach the final of same competition in 2011 where they lost 3-1 to Soweto
giants Orlando Pirates. Dylan Kerr's coached side were eager  to return to
winning ways having lost two consecutive league games, a 3-0 defeat to
Bloemfontein Celtic and Mamelodi Sundowns who beat them by the same margin.
