He is 109 years old and can still ride a bicycle. Mvangeli Thomo from Buhlebesizwe near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga is still going strong and can still ride a bicycle for more than 50 km without getting tired. He said he might not be eager to perform his bedroom duties with his 83-year-old wife but the energy he has is for his bicycle. “I think we are too old for that as I don’t even remember when was the last time we did it.” Thomo who is partially deaf and blind grew up in Nhlazatshe herding cattle and goats and still loves watching soccer but he is not a fan of any team. He said he favours whoever wins on that day. "I thank God for keeping me this far. I still feel very strong and I do things for myself even though my hearing and sight are no longer good enough,” said Thomo. "My bike helps me a lot because I use it when going to get my pension grant. My legs are not tired yet and a new one can come in handy,” he said. Madala said eating healthy is one of the reasons he lived this long and that he stopped drinking alcohol many years ago and that helped a lot. His wife Maria Masange said for her husband to live this long is because of morogo and milk. “We don't eat nice things as most of them are not good for health. I made him to stop drinking alcohol and smoking. He also loves working and going out riding his bike," said Maria. "He teaches his grandchildren to ride and fix their bikes. He wants them to be like him,” she said. Madala and Maria had nine children and only five are still alive, four grandchildren and nine great grandchildren. He will be turning 110 on 18 February and his birthday wish is a new bicycle.
