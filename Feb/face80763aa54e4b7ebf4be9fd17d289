WHEN William Mashaba turned 100, his kids and grandkids came together and organised a big birthday party. Madala Mashaba, who is a reverend at his local church, thanked his family for acknowledging him at the celebration held in Rebone Village in Steiloop, Limpopo, on Sunday. When asked how he had reached the age of 100, the madala said he mostly ate vegetables and praised God. “I’m thankful to my family for planning this birthday event for me. Other parents have reached 100 but there was never a celebration,” he said. “This is a very beautiful thing that has happened to me. I raised them and now they have paid me back.” Mashaba said his wife died 23 years ago but he had never dated again. Instead, he focused on raising his children so they could have a better future. His youngest daughter, Mamoruti (50), told Daily Sun her father was the first person in the family to each 100. She said he was still strong and could walk by himself and make tea. “He eats vegetables most of the time and avoids fatty food. “He is a loving father and he never disappointed us when we needed support. With this birthday party, we wanted to thank God for all the days of his life.” His grandchild, Amogelang Mashaba (30), said they bought him presents they knew he needed.
