Rescue Care paramedics found a newborn baby dumped in a rubbish bin on Bulwer Road in Glenwood, Durban, on Tuesday. Unfortunately the baby boy was already died. "Rescue Care paramedics were called to the scene by concerned residents around 12:45, after seeing the baby in the packet," operations director Garrith Jamieson said in a statement on Tuesday. One of the paramedics on the scene urged all mothers to seek help and assistance if need be, saying she had seen an increase in babies being dumped, Jamieson added.  The baby's body has since been handed over to the police for further investigation. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/newborn-babys-body-found-dumped-in-durban-bin-20190205
