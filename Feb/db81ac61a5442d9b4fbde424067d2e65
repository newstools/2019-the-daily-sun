WHEN Vhugala Ramawa’s family heard he had committed suicide, they went into deep mourning. But their tears turned into smiles on Monday afternoon when the 22-year-old turned up at the family home in Tshisahulu, Limpopo. It was believed Vhugala had drowned after jumping into a dam in the early hours of the morning. Vhugala had been drinking with a friend, who rushed to tell the family he had disappeared in the water. The cops were called and divers searched for Vhugala, but had no success. When news later broke that he had turned up at home, a crowd that had gathered at the dam rushed back to see the risen man. Cops then took him in for questioning. Aunt Jeanette said he had first tried to kill himself on Saturday by jumping into oncoming traffic, but he suffered minor injuries. “He told me he had problems, but I didn’t think he would go this far. Now that he’s back, we’ll sit down with him and try to sort out what’s troubling him.” Vhugala promised to talk to the SunTeam but ran away. Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Vhugala’s girlfriend came to the scene and informed cops that he was well and alive. “This was confirmed to be true and police stopped the search,” said Ngoepe.
