Legendary Canadian-born, American-based singer and songwriter, Tamia has thanked her local fans for having stood by her over her 20-year career. The 43-year-old R&B icon, who released her first album, Tamia in 1998, has already passed two decades of being one of the most prolific hit-makers of her time. And over the past 20 years, she has been to Mzansi twice, with her latest tour being her third. Tamia Live in SA has seen her perform in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban. And now that the tour has wrapped, the singer took to her Instagram to express her gratitude, captioning one of her videos with “What a moment”. Before she began her tour, however, she told the Daily Sun just how meaningful her SA fans are, especially since she didn’t know as a child that her talent could get her this far. “I don’t know if I knew that I could make it a job but I think that the best part is that you always continue to strive to do better, strive to continue to be creative, and you always stay in awe, for me, that I am able to do this 20 years later and love it, and people still care, people are still excited and they have such love for you as an artist. You stand in a place of appreciation, I don’t take for granted, the people that come to the shows, I feel blessed that I am to continue to do what I love,” she said.  “The world seemed a lot bigger when I was younger so I don’t think I ever thought that I could become famous. I knew that I loved to sing and I knew that I loved to perform. I knew that I could affect people through music, being 10-years-old and singing and seeing people crying, I knew that music was powerful,” she said.
