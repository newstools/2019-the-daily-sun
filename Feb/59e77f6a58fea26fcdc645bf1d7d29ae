Members of the South African National Civic Organisation together with medical staff and Pastor Mboro gathered at the Baragwanath Hospital to protest. They were there to hand over a memorandum to the management on issues affecting the workers. The doctors downed tools for an hour to say they have had enough of the working conditions that they are subjected to deal with on the daily basis. “Our people are dying on hospital benches waiting for doctors,” Sanco spokesman Simphiwe Hlafa said. “It is time the authorities took into consideration issues raised by the doctors who work in appalling conditions at Bara.” “Issues such as the shortage of equipment or tools, porters, cleaning staff and nurses need to be addressed,” Hlafa said. Hlafa said Baragwanath was in Soweto, so the budget and laws regulating the hospital were still informed by apartheid planning and budgets. Phashe Magagane handed over a memorandum to the hospital management and it was signed for by Thokozani Langa coming from the office of the MEC. “We have heard all your grievances and we’ll get back to you within the seven days time frame that you have set for us,” said Langa.
