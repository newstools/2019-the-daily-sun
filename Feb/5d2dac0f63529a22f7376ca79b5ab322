A PUPIL was shot in a classroom at Dowerglen High School in Ekurhuleni on Wednesday! The 18-year-old pupil was rushed to hospital, where he was treated for injuries. This was after cable thieves gained access to a nearby telecommunications tower and security guards were alerted. The guards responded and spotted four suspects on the premises. Two suspects were arrested on the scene, while two fled on foot. One of the suspects allegedly ran onto the school premises and that is when shots were fired. The pupil, who was in a classroom, was hit by a stray bullet. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun the pupil was hit in the upper body. He said police are investigating a case of attempted murder. Masondo said police continued with the search for the fourth suspect and found him hiding in a nearby house. “He was arrested,” he said. He said police seized an Isuzu bakkie believed to have been used by the suspects. “The arrested suspects will appear in the Edenvale Magistrates Court soon,” said Masondo.
