ON Friday a woman accused of performing evil deeds narrowly escaped death. Angry residents of Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, wanted to attack the woman after she was found in a neighbour’s yard in the early hours of the morning. She was dressed as a sangoma, with a bucket and a broom, and apparently spreading muthi. The homeowner called cops and she was rescued. After she was confronted, she said she had come to fetch the spirit of her boyfriend, who died about 10 years ago. It’s understood the boyfriend was the previous owner of the house. When the SunTeam arrived at the scene, angry residents were chanting for her to leave the area. The residents claimed she had been cursing young women so that they wouldn’t get married. One gogo said: “Her yard has big holes and only God knows what those are for. We’ve tolerated her for long but it’s time for her to pack and go.” The owner of the house refused to speak to the SunTeam. Resident Nontobeko Nzama (37) said: “This woman said she’s haunted by the spirit of her dead boyfriend and came to fetch his spirit. Why would she do it at night and not ask for permission?” “She said the bucket contained a mixture of her urine, ash and cleaning chemicals. She must thank the homeowner for calling the police because residents wanted to take the law into their own hands.” Captain Piet Rossouw could not confirm whether the woman was taken to the police station.said the incident was not reported to the police.
