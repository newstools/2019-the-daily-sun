ALL Israel Seitisho wanted was to turn his bad luck around, but he ended up making things worse. The 31-year-old from Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, said he went to a sangoma to get muthi for luck but was given the wrong kind. He said for the past five years, he had been living in terror as he started feeling strange sensations in his body after taking the muthi. “I stopped taking the muthi, but since then things have not been going well for me,” he said. Israel said he started losing jobs for no reason and everything in his life was going wrong. He said when he visited another sangoma, he was told a woman called Moratimang was living inside him. The sangoma said she didn’t want Israel to succeed or live a normal life. “I want this Moratimang to leave me alone so my life can get back to normal. “I have sores on my bum and sometimes my right thigh feels like a bone has broken off and is moving up and down inside me,” he said. The SunTeam spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamazi, who said these kinds of things happen when there’s confusion between the patient and the sangoma. He said the ancestors of the patient and the sangoma could also be in conflict. “He needs to find a sangoma who will cleanse him of the bad luck.”
