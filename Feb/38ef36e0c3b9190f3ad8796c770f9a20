Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will face the Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Correctional Services on Tuesday morning. The committee will discuss a draft report on the request to
remove Mkhwebane. The draft report comes after the High Court in Pretoria
ruled that she over-reached her power when she recommended that the South
African Reserve Bank (SARB) mandate be changed. Mkhwebane's report in 2017 found that SARB’s R1.125bn
bailout of Bankorp between 1985 and 1995 was unlawful and that ABSA – which
bought the bank in 1992 – should pay back the money. The report saw ABSA and SARB seek a court review of the
report, which saw a back-and-forth of court papers. The Reserve Bank asked the court to order Mkhwebane to pay
costs out of her own pocket, and a declaratory order from the court that she
has abused her office.
