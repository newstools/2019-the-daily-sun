A MUM accused of killing her son decided to abandon her bail application. Ellen Monareng (37) appeared in the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga yesterday. Monareng cried uncontrollably when she was escorted back to her prison cell. She wasn’t asked to plead on the charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Her lawyer, Isaac Mkhonto, told the court that if the state continued with the schedule 6 offence against the accused, they would not apply for bail for now. Schedule 6 offences include murder and premeditated murder. Mkhonto said his client committed the crime after an argument with her son over an ID. Monareng’s husband, Runos Machave, said he was disappointed that she’d abandoned her bail hearing. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba postponed the case until 6 March.
