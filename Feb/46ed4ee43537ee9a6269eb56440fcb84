LIFE is hard for gogo and her family. Gogo Helen Nthite (65) lives with her daughter Kgomotso (32) and four grandchildren in a one-roomed house in Tshepisong, Soweto. They are struggling to rebuild their home after it burned to the ground in December last year. Her daughter is unemployed and they survive on social grants. Said Gogo Helen: “In December, we spent three weeks without electricity. They kept telling us it was load shedding. “On that Friday, the electricity came back while I was asleep and I heard a funny sound in the kitchen,” said the gogo. When she checked, she found smoke in the house. “The fire started in the kitchen and spread everywhere, burning everything in the house.” Gogo said the family ran out and called for help. “I thought I was dreaming when I saw my house being destroyed. “We were lucky no one was injured,” she said. Kgomotso said: “Firefighters were called, but the house was already destroyed by the time they arrived.” She said they needed help to rebuild their house. “We’re forced to live in a one-roomed house. And when it rains the roof leaks. “We appeal to SunReaders to help us rebuild our home and donate anything they can to help us.”
