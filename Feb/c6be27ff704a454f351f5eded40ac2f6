A MANHUNT has been launched after thugs apparently got in through the roof at MBP Security Company in Fairview, Joburg, and stole 20 guns on Tuesday. According to information received by police, the owner locked the building in the afternoon and left the safe key inside a drawer in the office. “On Wednesday, he arrived at his offices and found the safe open and ceiling damaged. The suspects got in through the roof and found the key to the safe,” said Captain Richard Munyayi. “They destroyed a CCTV camera before opening the safe. A case was opened.” Anyone with information is urged to call 011 624 6060 or 10111.
