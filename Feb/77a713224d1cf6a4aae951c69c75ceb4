THE commercial crimes unit in the Eastern Cape is investigating a case of theft against one of their members. Investigations started after more than R20 000 went missing from the safe at a cop shop in Matatiele. A former station commander is suspected of stealing money from the safe, which was in his office. He allegedly did not hand over the keys to the safe to the acting station commander when he left to take a promotional post at Ngqeleni late last year. The acting commander apparently enquired about the keys from the suspect, who allegedly kept promising to bring them back. Two months later, the acting commander received a call from a cop who told him the suspect had left the keys at a community service centre. The next morning, the acting commander opened the safe to check whether everything was in order. Everything was allegedly written down, including bail receipts and other documents, but there was no money. The receipts showed that a total of R24 450 was outstanding, along with other receipts. Provincial police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni confirmed that a case of theft was opened against a cop. “The matter is still under investigation and no arrests have been made yet,” he said.
