THE 38-year-old woman from Fochville in Merafong, Gauteng, said her 13-year-old son started his bad behaviour when he was only six. “He started robbing other kids. I thought he was just a kid and he would grow out of it, but he has become worse.” She said when she had another child, the older son didn’t hide the fact that he didn’t like his little brother. “I tried to explain to him that I loved them both, but he didn’t accept that.” She said her son poured boiling water over his younger brother when the boy was only two. She took the injured boy to her family for his own protection. But when the older son turned nine, he raped both his younger brother and the brother’s friend. “I went to the police but they refused to take him,” she said. She said her son also takes drugs and has been expelled from three schools. “He carries a knife at school and threatens teachers,” said Patricia. “I’ve been called to the school countless times.” Daily Sun spoke to social development spokeswoman Busisiwe Kheswa, who said officers will be sent to the mum’s house to assess the situation. “We’ll communicate with the police and see what can be done,” she said. “Parents should report such situations immediately. The earlier the better.” Fochville police spokeswoman Elsie Tshonte said she wasn’t sure if a case has been opened. “Police will visit her and assess the problem,” said Tshonte.
