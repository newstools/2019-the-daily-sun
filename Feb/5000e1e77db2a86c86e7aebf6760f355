A GROUP of unemployed young people took to the streets of Mkhuhlu in Bushbuckridge on Monday. They marched for jobs and because they want their ward councillor sacked. Leader of the march, Lucky Nyalungu, told Daily Sun the number of unemployed young people in the area is escalating every day. He said unemployment forced a lot of young people into a life of crime and drug abuse. And he claimed their ward councillor only gave jobs to his relatives. “Our councillor instructs companies not to hire us young people from Mkhuhlu.” “The municipality has seven working days to respond and address the problem of youth unemployment.” The marchers said mayor Sylvia Nxumalo needed to intervene. Councillor Lot Nkuna denied the claims of nepotism. He accused the marchers of having a hidden agenda and using the community to attack him. “I work closely with traditional leaders as they are the ones who know what the community needs. “When investors approach them, they are the ones who share the news with the community and tell them how many employees are needed.” Municipal office manager Fhumulani Thovhakale received the memorandum and promised to forward it to the mayor’s office.
