WHEN he was still in the womb, scans showed that only 2
percent of his brain had developed. Fearing the worst, doctors advised parents Shelley and
Rob Wall from England to abort the foetus. But they insisted they wanted to have the child, no
matter what – and so the miracle called Noah was born. Dad Rob told TV show GMB: "I think possibly if
younger people were offered that choice of abortion, they may have felt
pressured into taking it. "Because we're older parents, we know our own minds
and we're positive people. We wanted to give Noah the chance of life." Noah is now seven years old and progressing amazingly
well. At age 3, another brain scan showed that his brain had grown to as much
as 80 percent of the size it should be. Some doctors thought there may be a blockage squashing Noah’s
brain in to a small space, so the operation to clear any obstacle may have also
helped. "Even if his brain had been so squashed up, he'd be
severely mentally disabled because of all that damage and look at him - he's as
bright as a button," said Rob. Although Noah can talk, see, hear and eat by himself, he
struggles with many other tasks. He’s only recently learnt to sit unaided, and
still needs to learn to walk. A visit to a brain specialist centre in Australia helped
him hugely – he even managed to go surfing.
