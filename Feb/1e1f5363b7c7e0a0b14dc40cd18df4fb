ANGRY residents want the local municipality to build them proper RDPs. Failing which, they said, they won’t vote. “We’re angry with the municipality. The houses they built for us are collapsing and full of cracks,” said Mpho Ramaremela, a spokesman for the residents in Olievenhoutbosch extension 60, Tshwane. He said when residents moved into the area in 2016 from Mooiplaas squatter camp, the municipality promised them their houses would be built in the same year. He said Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga promised about two years ago during a visit that the project would have been finalised by December last year. “Nothing has been done. Our RDPs are falling apart,” said Mpho. He said last year they rescued a girl from an abandoned manhole. “We’re tired of using water from JoJo tanks. We don’t want mobile toilets. We also want open trenches to be covered,” he said. He said residents were reluctant to vote in the upcoming election. They delivered a memorandum of demands in January at the municipality offices. Nothing came of it. Housing and human settlement development services MMC, Mandla Nkomo, said: “We’ll finalise the building of the houses.”
