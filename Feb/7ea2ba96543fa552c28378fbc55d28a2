IT HAS been more than a month since Mazimane Kraulane went missing and his family is begging him to come home. The 42-year-old disappeared from his home in Kameelboom, near Rustenburg in the North West, on 14 January. His younger brother Vusumuzi (29) said they heard from people in the area that Mazimane was in neighbouring Magong Village. But when they went there he was nowhere to be found. “We’re asking people out there to help us find my brother. He was last seen attending a wedding but never came back home,” he said. “Mazimane please come back home.” Vusumuzi said his brother loved going to events in Kameelboom and surrounding villages. “When he left he was wearing a pink string with a bone around his neck, blue jeans and pink flip flops,” said Vusumuzi.
