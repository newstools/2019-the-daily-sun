WHEN Lakhiwe Ludidi (33) fell ill and went to hospital, she took her baby with her because there was no one to look after the child. But when she was discharged she was told her baby had died. That was in 2005, and years later Lakhiwe still doesn’t know what happened to her baby. “I know she didn’t die in the hospital. All these years I’ve been coming here and no one has been able to give clear answers,” said Lakhiwe, from Wonderkop in Marikana. She was treated for TB at Job Shimankana Tabane Hospital in Rustenburg, North West. She said when she went to fetch her child from the ward, she was told to come back for her the next day. When she returned she was told the baby had died. She asked to see the body, but the hospital mortuary had not recorded any baby’s death that day. Hospital CEO Dr Moagi Bogosi said: “The hospital doesn’t generally permit babies who are not ill to sleep over at the facility. It’s highly unlikely that the baby was kept in the hospital for the duration of the mum’s TB treatment.” The department is still investigating.
