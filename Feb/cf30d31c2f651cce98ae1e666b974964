FOR weeks Molihi Thagane (36) had been craving umqombothi, so he couldn’t wait for a celebration planned for Saturday. But Molihi would never drink the beer. The man from Phase 9 kasi in Mangaung was stabbed and killed not far from his kasi, where the traditional ceremony was to be hosted. According to his mother Dile Thagane (54), a gang called Born to Kill took her son’s life for no reason. Dile said her son’s death was overwhelming. “When I heard the news I was so shocked I couldn’t breathe,” she said. “My son was everything to me. He was a good man. He enjoyed his beer but never fought with anybody. He was loved by his community. Even if he was only doing temporary jobs, he made sure we had food to eat.” She said they wanted justice. “We ask the police to arrest my son’s killers. My soul will not rest until the killers go to jail,” said Dile. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed that a case of murder was opened. “The dead man had a stab wound in his chest. No one has been arrested. Anyone with information should please call Bloemspruit Police Station on 082 526 2691,” he said.
