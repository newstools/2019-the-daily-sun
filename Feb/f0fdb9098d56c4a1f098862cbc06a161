Wiaan Mulder has been released from South Africa's Test squad to join the Highveld Lions in their One Day Cup campaign. The 20-year-old was a part of the Proteas squad for the first Test against Sri Lanka that got underway in Durban on Wednesday morning, but he will have to wait a little longer before making his debut in the format. On the eve of the Test, skipper Faf du Plessis had suggested that Mulder could make his debut at Kingsmead given South Africa's desire for a genuine allrounder in their Test side. Instead, the decision was taken to back Vernon Philander at No 7 in a four-pronged pace attack that also includes Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada and Duanne Olivier while spinner Keshav Maharaj also gets a game. Mulder, meanwhile, is considered part of the plans for this year's World Cup in England and the South African brains trust would rather see him playing limited overs cricket over the next few days. The Lions are in action on Wednesday afternoon when they host the Warriors at the Wanderers, and Mulder is expected to play in that match. https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/Proteas/mulder-released-from-proteas-test-squad-20190213
