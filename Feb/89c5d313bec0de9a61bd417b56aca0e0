FORMER Numsa president Cedric Gina’s friends and family said he was abandoned by the union he founded. His friend Khanyisani Shandu (40) on Saturday told mourners that Gina died of stress because the Liberated Metalworkers Union of South Africa (Limusa) mistreated him. Gina’s funeral was held at Richards Bay Sports Complex, KZN. The funeral was attended by Cosatu president Zingiswa Losi, Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu and provincial ANC chairman Sihle Zikalala. Family spokesman Bongani Gina said Gina resigned in November because he was being harassed by people who wanted his position at the new union. “It is unbelievable that Limusa could not afford to pay for Cedric’s medical aid or send him to a private hospital. “We know someone wanted him out of the union so he could take the position of general secretary,” he said. Limusa general secretary Siboniso Mdletshe said Gina was not forced to resign. Gina resigned as Numsa president in 2013 after the union said it would not campaign for the ANC the following year.
