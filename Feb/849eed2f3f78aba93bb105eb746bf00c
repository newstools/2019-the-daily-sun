A SENIOR member of Uganda’s parliament is facing court
action for allegedly failing to pay a sangoma for muthi that he says is
responsible for her success. Sangoma Damiano Akuze is demanding Shs204,5 million
(about R739 000) for work that he did on Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga 29
years ago. According to Daily Monitor, Akuze filed his suit against Kadaga
in Jinja High Court in the south of the country on Monday. In his court papers, Akuze claims that Kadaga approached
him at his shrine in Buwala, north of Kampala in 1990. “The defendant (Speaker Kadaga) requested the plaintiff (the
sangoma) to work on her so that she would be given a big job in government and
also be driven in a convoy like a president. “The defendant did not have money to pay the plaintiff at
the time. The plaintiff agreed to work on her on condition that she would pay
the plaintiff as soon as she got the job,” states Akuze. For two nights, on the 1 and 2 September 1990,
Akuze says he “worked on Kadaga”, “and the defendant acknowledged the good care
that the plaintiff gave to her”. “Immediately on the 3rd day of September 1990, the
defendant (Kadaga) was called by President Museveni and appointed minister and
has since then held big positions in government,” states Akuze. Akuze claims that he and Kadaga had made a deal at the
time that she would reward him for his powerful muthi by building him a house
worth Shs100 million (about R361 000), a tipper truck worth Shs60 million
(about R217 000), a plot of land worth Shs40 million (about R145 000) and four
cows, among other things. The total value comes to Shs204,5 million. But Kadaga has failed to honour their contract and only
coughed up Shs1 million (about R3 600) in 2017, says Akuze. Kadaga has yet to file her defence. Once she has, a date
will be set for a hearing. Kadaga could not be reached for comment, according to Daily
Monitor.
