IN order to reduce the rate of izinyoka connections, Eskom is inviting residents with illegal connections to come forward. These people will either be allowed to pay half their fine or nothing at all. The campaign was launched in Rustenburg, North West, on Friday. There are 5 157 prepaid customers in Sunrise, Robega and Rasimone villages, near Rustenburg, but only 566 buy electricity. Eskom is trying to decrease this through the launch of the Come Clean Campaign. The drive aims to encourage customers to come clean about illegal connections. Depending on the seriousness of the illegal connection, customers stand a chance of not paying any fine at all. Other benefits include free meters, no power disconnections, reduction of rising tariffs and reduced safety risks. Customers will be given three months – from April until June – to come forward. Platinum customer services manager Ezekiel Baruti said it was important for people to make amends. He said this would eliminate many challenges they might face if they decided to hide their electrical status. He said faults found at the visited villages would be investigated. “A team will be sent for further investigation. It will then be determined when last electricity was bought and the verification of meter boxes per household will then begin,” he said. Home owner Masego Motsegoa (27) has a meter box running on free units. She said she bought the meter box for R800 from agents claiming to be from Eskom. Masego said she will visit Eskom’s offices to discuss the reduction of a fine because she is unemployed.
