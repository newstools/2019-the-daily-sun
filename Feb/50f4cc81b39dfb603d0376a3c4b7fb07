Cape Town City have announced the signing of former Ajax Cape Town captain Travis Graham. The 25-year-old is said to have joined The Citizens on a short term deal following a lengthy spell without a club. The midfielder is expected to take some time to return to full fitness having last played a competitive game back in May 2017. He joins a team that is thin in the midfield areas following injuries to the midfield pair of Roland Putsche and Thabo Nodada. Putsche suffered a meniscus tear while Nodada had a leg fracture, both are set to miss the rest of the season. Once fit, Graham is set to slot into the City midfield as they look to end the season on a high note. Benni McCarthyâ€™s charges are fifth on the PSL standings, seven points behind leaders Bidvest Wits. They have also booked a spot in the quarter-finals of the Nedbank Cup.
