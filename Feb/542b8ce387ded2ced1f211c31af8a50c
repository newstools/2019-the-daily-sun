“WE WANT our principal back!” These were the words of residents and parents who stormed the entrance of Thuto Lefa Secondary School. Residents of Lawley extension 2 in Joburg said since the previous principal was removed, the school had become a haven for gangsters. Parents told the SunTeam gang members, some of them pupils, terrorised their kids at school. They said they spoke to the SGB several times, fearing for their children’s safety but they would never agree to a meeting. Thandiwe Nibe, whose son (19) was apparently stabbed with scissors at school, said his attacker had been picking on him before the incident. She said since then, he was afraid to go to school but she didn’t have the money to move him. Mapaseka Mohloai said her 13-year-old son was moered with a golf stick in December. “He was approached by gangsters and beaten. Guards let these people walk into school with weapons. He goes to school in fear because the people who beat him are still around.” Another resident said the pupils were always fighting. “There is a fight every day after school.” Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the matter was being investigated. “We appeal to residents not to disrupt schooling.”
