AN
ambulance has been pelted with stones and beer bottles in Tickeyline in Tzaneen. The
Limpopo Department of Health said it has noted the incident with dismay. "With
all the criminal activities which have been taking place in health facilities,
the department has since adopted a zero tolerance on any form of rogue behavior
meted against staff,‚Äù Health spokesperson Neil Shikwambana said. He
said the department will do everything in its power to protect the wellbeing of
staff members and its property. Shikwambana
went on to say the department has opened a case with the police against the
alleged perpetrators and believes that police will affect an arrest soon, so
that they can face the full might of the law. "The
department will not standby and watch when rogue elements and criminals targets
and terrorizes its staff members and its property," Shikwambana said. The
department calls upon all law abiding citizens to jealously protect health care
facilities, tools of trading and health care workers who exist for the sole
purpose of providing care to community members.
