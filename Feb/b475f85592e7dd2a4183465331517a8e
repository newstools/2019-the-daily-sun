A three-day manhunt led to the arrest of a man who was wanted in connection with the murder of his lover earlier this week. The woman's body was found in Soul City informal settlement in Kagiso on the West Rand on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Captain Solomon Sibiya said police responded to a scene where they found the body of a woman, who had been stabbed multiple times in her neck and upper right arm. Her ears had been cut off. Investigations led them to the woman's lover on Friday. The man was arrested at a local shebeen and, in addition to the murder charge, he will face additional charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. He is expected to appear in the Kagiso Magistrate's Court soon. Station commander of Kagiso police station, Brigadier Themba Maduna said they would not allow lawlessness where women and children were victims of severe brutality. "We will act harshly to those who do not have respect for life," he added. On Wednesday, West Rand police arrested 14 people, including Basotho nationals, following the discovery of a woman's mutilated body. The 14 people were arrested for various offences during a confrontation about the discovery of the body. "Residents then believed that the Basotho nationals were responsible for the death of the woman. Angry residents then charged at the group and a shootout ensued," Sibiya said at the time. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-arrested-for-murder-of-his-lover-cutting-off-her-ears-20190215
