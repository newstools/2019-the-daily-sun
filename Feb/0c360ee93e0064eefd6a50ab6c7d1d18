Crisis! Two of Mzansi’s IT girls have been spotted with the same look. Boity Thulo and Thulisile Phongolo both rocked the same two-piece ensemble in the same week. And as is always the case with a B***c stole my look moment, we need your help picking the best look. The outfit is a black and brown two-piece palazzo pants and floor-length jacket in snakeskin pattern which both stars bought from online boutique, Fashion Never. WHO WORE IT BEST: PEARL MODIADIE VS THULISA KEYI The look was first spotted on actress and DJ, Thuli P over on Monday at the Embassy Towers in Sandhurst, Johannesburg. She wore the look with the jacket closed, covering her inner garment. She paired it with gold hoop earrings, curly hair and black heels. Boity on the other hand wore the look at a restaurant in Jozi yesterday. WHO WORE IT BEST? She chose to tie the jacket to her waist with the matching belt but still giving us full viewer of her black bustier. She accessorized the look with her stunning new short pixie cut, black sandals and a Gucci handbag. So, who wore it best? It’s been a good day. ????????: @fashionnever #ShortHairDontCare #OwnYourThrone?? A post shared by  Boitumelo Thulo (@boity) on Jan 31, 2019 at 6:10am PST  Look good. Feel good.
