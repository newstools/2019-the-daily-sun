The Democratic Alliance (DA) has raised concerns over reports that Eskom plans to retrench skilled white workers. According to the DA these include engineers and
managers, in order to meet affirmative action targets. DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises Natasha Mazzone said
while transformation of the workforce is crucial in our country, these
retrenchments come at a time that Eskom requires skilled and experienced
technicians. “Eskom cannot simply retrench employees based on the colour
of their skin. The South African constitution is clear about discrimination on
the basis of race,” Mazzone said. Mazzone  said if this
is indeed true, Eskom will not only be in contravention of the Constitution,
but they would also be shooting themselves and the South African public in the
foot. “I will therefore write to Minister Pravin Gordhan to
urgently clarify and condemn the comments which have allegedly been made by
Eskom. He needs to categorically state if this is a government position,” she
added. She said South Africa has been plunged into darkness by
Eskom under the leadership of the failing ANC. Mazzone  further said
the job of turning around Eskom requires skilled and experienced workers who
will ensure that the lights are switched back on.
