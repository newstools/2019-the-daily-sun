AN Mpumalanga mother is pleading with the community to help her find her nine-year-old son, who disappeared on Wednesday (30 Jan). Nomzamo Thabede (32) from Matsulu outside Mbombela, in Mpumalanga, said Thanduxolo Sam was last seen when he left home to play with his friends. Said Nomzamo: “I came back from work and noticed that he was not at home. “I started getting worried that it was getting late and Thanduxolo was still not back home. “We then launched a search with my family, but couldn’t find him.” The mum told Daily Sun they learned that Thanduxolo had planned to go fishing at the Crocodile River with friends after school. But he didn’t arrive and his friends claimed they last saw him at a shop buying snacks. The mother added that she was disappointed because the police didn’t take the matter seriously, even after the family asked them to search for the boy in the river. “We were told different stories by the police and are not satisfied with the way they conducted their search. “The community of Matsulu is helping us look for my son,” she said. Nomzamo said they also went to search the house of a traditional healer suspected of having kidnapped Thanduxolo. “We told police about this man we suspect but they didn’t take the matter seriously. “We had to force them to go to his place and are still not happy because we believe he is there. Police have failed us. “I can’t sleep or eat, and will not rest until we find our son. Those who took him should bring him back. I want him alive,” pleaded the mother. Mpumalanga police spokesman, Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, said police are investigating a missing person’s case. “The body of the boy has not been found. Police divers are searching for the body,” he said.
