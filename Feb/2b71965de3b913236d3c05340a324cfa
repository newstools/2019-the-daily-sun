A 17-year-old pupil was stabbed in a alleged revenge attack at
Trenance Park Secondary School in KwaZulu Natal. Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) reportedly received a call from the
school requesting medical help for the injured student. The pupil was stabbed on the chest, arm and ribs. According to the student, he had transferred to Trenance
Park Secondary from Bothas Hill - KZN at the beginning of the term. “This morning he was standing in the vicinity of the tuck
shop when he was approached by a grade 11 learner and two of his friends.” One of learners drew a knife and without warning repeatedly
stabbed him, before they fled from the school,” RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram
