 THREE pupils have died and over 15 pupils injured when a
walkway collapsed at Hoerskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark. ER24 spokesperson, Russell Meiring said it remains unclear
what could have led to the collapse. Rescue services utilized various rescue tools to free the

with advanced life support interventions. Once treated, four
children were airlifted to hospital by a private medical helicopter. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to various
facilities in the area,” Meiring said. The details surrounding this incident are not yet known. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said on Twitter: “Moments
