IT’S been five years since the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport started rebuilding Vereeniging Taxi Rank in the Vaal, south of Joburg. Following a number of delays, the department hired engineers to supervise the project. The department also promised to use internal maintenance teams to complete the project. The taxi rank will be turned into multi-transport facility. Prasa promised to renovate Vereeniging Station, improve the train drivers’ facilities and increase the amount of parking space at the site. Department head Ronald Swartz said it was predicted the project would be completed this year, subject to funding approval from the provincial treasury. “The initial contract was delayed due to unforeseen conditions that resulted in design changes and work stoppages. “The appointed contractor has been placed under provisional liquidation,” he said. The project, which is a partnership with Prasa as well as the Sedibeng and Emfuleni municipalities, started in 2014, and was supposed to be completed within 12 months.
