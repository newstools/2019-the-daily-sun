Employees locked the gate denying the management access to the hospital. They wanted their complaints to be heard. However, one man was nearly assaulted when he walked past the protesting crowd straight to open the gate. The angry crowd tried dragging him out of the gate but he held on to something refusing to go. A man who was trapped inside the hospital used a hosepipe to disperse that crowd.
