WHEN Seun Mabedi was told he would never walk again after a car accident, he became very sad and angry. However, these days the 29-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, has accepted his condition and is smiling again. He told Daily Sun: “My family loves me and brings me joy and happiness. Love is the right tool to heal my pain.” Seun said he became disabled five months ago after crashing into a taxi that had suddenly stopped in front of his car. “I can’t feel my right leg anymore and I don’t eat much anymore. Only two slices of bread is enough for me,” he said. Seun said his sleeping patterns have also changed. He used to sleep eight hours in a night but now he can only manage two. “Some people say it’s because I’m stressed but this is not the case. I have accepted the fact that I’m disabled.” Seun said his condition taught him to be patient as he sometimes faced challenges like not being picked up by taxis. Seun said he would soon start studying medicine. He wants to help people who have lost their ability to walk through accidents.
