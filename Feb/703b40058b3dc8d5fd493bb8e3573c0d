If he hadn’t become a comedian, Tol Ass Mo would’ve been a computer scientist. Although Mo (real name Mongezi Mahlangu) quit studying computer engineering after six months, he still loves everything to do with IT. He became a comedian by accident. “I was at an event with my friends and the MC wasn’t feeling well. Apparently, he had flu and he had a hoarse voice. My friends dared me to go on stage as they knew I was a good MC. “Instead of being the MC I saw funny things in the audience. I started talking about them and that’s how my career took off.” Mo said there’s another side to him. “At home, I’m a dad, brother, husband and a cook. My family is my biggest inspiration. “When I started out, my aunts would be angry as I made jokes about them, but that has since changed.” He was featured in Bump The Cheese Up by rapper Reason in 2014. “I was talking to Reason and used the phrase, ‘bump the cheese up’. He thought it would make a great song and that’s how I got into music,” he said. He also owns a gaming solutions company called TAM Gaming, to be launched on 7 March in Juta Street, Braamfontein, Joburg.) Catch Mo in The Lover’s Comedy Rock tomorrow in Kimberley, on 1 March in Welkom and on 28 March at The Blue Room, Pretoria. “I’ve always been a gamer. I’ve loved games from the age of six when my uncle bought me a game,” he said. “But my wife isn’t that keen on gaming so I found a way I could make my wife happy and make money through games so I started the company.”
