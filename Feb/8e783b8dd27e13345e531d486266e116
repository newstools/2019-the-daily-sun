MTHOKOZISI Mkhize said he still didn’t understand how he escaped a tragedy that killed his three colleagues. The 26-year-old was watching four fellow construction workers digging a trench in Isipingo, north of Durban, when a wall next to it collapsed on them. When the SunTeam visited the scene yesterday, Mthokozisi was there. He said he was sitting next to the wall and watching his colleagues dig when tragedy struck. “It was my off day, and since we all live in the flat being worked on I went to visit them. “I was called by another man and stood up. Right after I had left, the wall fell.” Mthokozisi said they managed to pull one injured man from underneath the wall, but the other three were too deep in the ground and they couldn’t reach them. “We come from different places, but among the dead is a man from Mozambique and another one is from Uganda. “I’m not sure about the third one, but I heard he lived in Malukazi. None of us know their families, and I don’t think they’ve been notified.” A resident said the men were digging a deep trench very close to the wall of another block of flats, which is why it collapsed. Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was opened. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
