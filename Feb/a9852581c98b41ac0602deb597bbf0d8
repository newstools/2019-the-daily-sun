MATHEW Yesaya’s family needs SunLanders’ help to find him. The 28-year-old from Pretoria West went missing early last month while visiting a friend in Nellmapius, Tshwane. His brother Majawa Tsilizani (45) told Daily Sun on the day of his disappearance, his brother left at 5.45pm. “He was wearing black jeans, a black jacket and black takkies.” Majawa said his brother is short, dark in complexion and 1,5m tall. “I’ve looked everywhere and even went to his workplace, but no one has seen him,” he said. Majawa said both Mathew and his friend’s phones were off. Police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said Mathew is originally from Malawi. He speaks English and his home language is Chichewa. A missing persons case has been opened. Vuma said anyone with information should contact her on 082 833 8313 or Majawa on 078 876 6916.
