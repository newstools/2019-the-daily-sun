A NO NONSENSE Eastern Cape Municipality has impounded 42 taxis in the past two months. Kouga Municipality said the taxis were impounded because they were a danger to road users. Kouga mayor Horatio Hendricks said the taxis were impounded by the Kouga Traffic Department between December and January for operating without public transport permits. “The municipality has been holding weekly roadblocks with the police to clamp down on illegal public transport operators. They will continue with this joint programme to help make our roads safe for all,” said Hendricks. He encouraged commuters to check the documents required by public transport operators and to avoid using taxis that do not follow the rules. “There are four discs that should be displayed on a taxi’s windscreen: a red public transport permit, the operator’s disc, a passenger liability disc and a standard licence disc. “If these discs are not visible and valid, there is a good chance you are making use of an illegal taxi.” Hendricks said some 18 months ago, the municipality established a depot at Humansdorp for impounded vehicles. “The depot has made it easier for our traffic department to execute their duties and keep commuters safe. “The facility is not only used for taxis, but also for vehicles that have been confiscated from drunk drivers and other offences.” He said for a first time offence, it costs R2 500 to release an impounded vehicle, R4 000 for a second offence, while a third offence costs R8 000.
