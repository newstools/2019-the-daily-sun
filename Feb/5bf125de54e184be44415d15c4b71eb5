TS GALAXY coach Dan “Dance” Malesela is not concerned about which team his side will draw in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals, he just hopes they will play at home. The Rockets beat fellow National First Division (NFD) outfit Jomo Cosmos 1-0 to book their place in the last 8 for the first time in their history. They’ll find out who their next opponents will be on Thursday when the draw for the quarter-finals takes place. Malesela backs his charges to be able to deal with whatever is put in front of them. But his only wish is to play in front of their home supporters in Kameelrivier. “We are happy to be in the last eight, said Malesela. “It was not easy. We made it difficult for ourselves by missing a lot of chances, but we got the job done and we move on to the next stage. “It doesn’t matter who we play next. We don’t fear anyone. I just hope we will play at home this time. “We haven’t played in front of our supporters so far in the Nedbank Cup and I think they deserve to be part of this journey. “It would be nice for us to showcase the atmosphere in Kameelrivier.” Having made it this far in the tournament, Malesela says they believe they can go all the way and win the Ke Yona cup. “We are not getting carried away,” added the former Chippa United mentor. “There’s still a lot of good teams left in the competition, but I would be lying if I told you we don’t fancy our chances. “It would be nice for us to go on and win the trophy. It would be a massive achievement for a club like ours.”
