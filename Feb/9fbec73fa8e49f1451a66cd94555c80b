THE unbundling of troubled Eskom into three entities may cost the African National Congress in this year’s general elections in May. This comes after the National Union of Mineworkers threatened to withdraw their support of the ANC if President Cyril Ramaphosa continues with the plan to break Eskom into three. Ramaphosa announced the plan last week during his second State of the Nation Address as the president of the republic. “If the ANC proceed with the unbundling of Eskom without taking all stakeholders along, it is going to cost the party dearly,’’ President of NUM Joseph Montisetse said on Thursday during a media briefing in Joburg. “The decision by the government to impose the independent power producers (IPPs) on Eskom is going to cost the ANC.” Some of the reasons cited for not supporting the unbundling of Eskom, are that it will bring along job losses and NUM as the stakeholder, was not consulted prior to the announcement of the unbundling of the power entity. The leadership of the mining union said they were shocked when such an announcement was made in Parliament last week and they only found out about it watching the SONA on TV. The NUM called on Ramaphosa to dissolve the current Eskom board, citing that it has failed to prevent load shedding from happening. For the past few days, there has been disruption particularly on the roads due to power outages as a result of load shedding. Montisetse said, “We call on the President to simply disband this incompetent board.” In an attempt to rescue the struggling Eskom, which supposedly has a potential of shutting down by April. Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan appointed a firm, to bring Italian engineers to fix Eskom power plants. Num however, is against this and has said there is nothing special about Italian engineers. “It is the management that must be held accountable for the performance of the plant,” he said.
