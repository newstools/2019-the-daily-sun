AFRICAN Content Movement leader Hlaudi Motsoeneng has called on former president Jacob Zuma and former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo to join his party. Motsoeneng was addressing hundreds of people at the People’s Park in Durban on Sunday. “You people of KZN must visit Zuma to recruit him to join ACM. I’m in talks with Mahumapelo because his party doesn’t like him too,” he said. He said his party had teamed up with taxi bosses as it planned to fight for the taxi industry not to be abused by government. Under his government, Motsoeneng said, taxi owners won’t have to renew permits every five years. He said all clinics will have doctors 24 hours, and each ambulance will go out with a doctor. He said he will bring back the 90% local music policy at all radio stations in the country.
