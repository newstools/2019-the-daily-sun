UNLIKE their church services, if the Gabola Church goes to parliament, it will be a very sober affair. Yesterday Daily Sun spoke to founder Bishop Tsietsi Makete at a service held at Green House Tavern in Evaton in the Vaal. He said their party would bring about sober thinking to save Mzansi from drowning. “We’re getting into politics, as we seem to be the only church which is aligned with the people,” said Makete. “The Gabola Church United National Front Party is here to be peacemakers in this political headache.” Makete said they had already registered with the IEC. “We’ve started with our working committees and the top six have been selected,” he said. The party is set to fight for national and local votes in the country.  “Our aim is to maintain peace in Mzansi. We’re going to start facelifting the education system. because that’s the future leaders of the country.  We will work with countries such as Botswana to try and compare ourselves with their judiciary to bring about a safe, crime-free country.” “Our tavern owners who are registered with the church will run as local proportional representative councillors.” Their manifesto launch is set for 2 March. “Once we get seats in parliament, we will also be restoring peace among political party leaderships,” said Makete. But being in politics doesn’t mean the end of the church. “The Sunday sessions of Cheers and Amen will continue,” he said.
