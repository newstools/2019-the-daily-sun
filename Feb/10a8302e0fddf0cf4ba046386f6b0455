SENTENCING proceedings against former police detective Alicia Beeming were postponed yesterday because the prosecutor was not available. The 34-year-old appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court briefly but will be back next week. Prosecutor Komani du Toit told magistrate Onke Manyathaza her colleague Mujaahid Sandan was unable to be present in court as he was busy with another matter. She asked the magistrate for the case to be postponed to Wednesday, and her request was granted. Beeming pleaded guilty to a charge of defeating the ends of justice in 2017 after keeping her relationship with Hans Jordaan secret. At the time, Jordaan was a wanted member of the Upstand Dogs gang and police were looking for him in connection with an attempted murder charge related to a 2014 gang shooting. At the time, she was a member of a unit investigating gang activity in Port Elizabethâ€™s Northern Areas. She also had access to case dockets investigated by the unit. She failed to inform police about their relationship and his whereabouts. Arguing in support of a heavy sentence, gang unit commander Colonel Mike Grobler testified Beeming broke the trust between the unit and the community. He said all the cases she had been investigating at the time were withdrawn.
