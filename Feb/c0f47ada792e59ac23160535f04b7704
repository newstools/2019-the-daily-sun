Wits University students are not satisfied with the response
they got from the institution yesterday. Today they embarked on a hunger strike and are camping at the
Solomon Mahlangu student enrolment centre until all their demands are met. On Monday the SRC deputy president Nkateko Muloiwa said they
were disrupting lectures because it is unfair that other students have already
started lectures, while others remained unregistered. He said: “We cut a deal with the institution, that students who
owe less than R100 000 would be allowed to register and start their lectures. Now they are taking us for fools and not keeping their
promise. “What’s worse is that over 500 students don’t have
accommodation and today they come and tell us they have managed to get a total
of 140 beds. It makes no difference for us.”
