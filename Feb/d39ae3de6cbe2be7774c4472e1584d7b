Our golden girl, Charlize Theron shared a major throwback on her Instagram page recently. The Hollywood bombshell had the world reeling over her ageless beauty when she posted a snap of herself from her modelling days. The photo is from a time when Charlize was still living in Mzansi, before she blew up and became and international actress. The Oscar-winning actress called the snap a “Marie Kondo” moment. “Pulled a full Marie Kondo and came across this gem. My first modeling competition back in South Africa,” she said. In 1991, Charlize won the New Model Today contest run by local Afrikaans magazine, Rooi Rose. Charlize is seen in the pic with a classic 90s hairdo and make-up while she sports a stunning red, chiffon wrap blouse. “Really wishing I kept this top,” the star said. Charlize has since become one of the most recognizable women in the world, even becoming the face of global luxury goods company, Christian Dior. Pulled a full Marie Kondo and came across this gem. My first modeling competition back in South Africa. Really wishing I kept this top. #tbt A post shared by  Charlize Theron (@charlizeafrica) on Feb 7, 2019 at 12:35pm PST
