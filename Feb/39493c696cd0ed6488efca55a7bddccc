MASALMANE Maruoa is a big dreamer with a passion for design and sewing. When the 30-year-old mum of two from Bergman kasi, Mangaung, realised her family needed extra income, she trained to become a seamstress. “I started my training in 2011 after being unemployed for a long time. “I’ve always been interested in the way people dress and like looking clean and smart. “At the time my husband was the only breadwinner. I enrolled myself for a one-year course, where I was taught ways of cutting and designing clothes.” Masalmane creates clothes for herself and people love what she wears. “I got orders from family and friends and my database has grown. “I believe my style and passion for creating new designs got people interested. “Orders came in numbers after I designed my wedding outfit.” Masalmane, whose clients are mostly people from her kasi, sells full traditional attire from R800. “I’m living my dream. I always wanted to be a seamstress and have started a school where I teach women to sew so they empower themselves. She also said: “I want to own a factory one day and start my own clothing line,” she said.
