WHILE many people love marula for its health benefits, two young men from Emfihlweni, claim it has a use not many are aware of. They claimed three cups of the juice keep their 4-5s awake all night. Sandile Mashaba (26) told Daily Sun the drink gave him energy to poke. “I enjoy it because it brings joy to my relationship. When it’s harvest time, I put some aside for the rest of the year,” he said. Simon Duze (38) said marula juice improved his performance in bed. “We harvest the fruit in January and store some in our fridge, and it lasts until May or June. “I’ve been with the same woman for the past seven years and she’s happy. “She always tells me to make juice during harvest time.” They said the juice was also good for women’s sexual performance in bed. Hlengiwe Mabika (34) said it boosted her appetite for sex. “This drink improves our sex lives. The drink also helps men who suffer from premature ejaculation,” she said.
