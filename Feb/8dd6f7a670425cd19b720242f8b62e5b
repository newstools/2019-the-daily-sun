A GROUP of FORMER Mfuleni primary School PUPILS donated new uniform to needy kids at the school in Cape Town. Yongama Matshoba (43) told Daily Sun they saw a need to help as they knew some parents could not afford to buy new uniform. “We were touched to see kids wearing old uniforms, so we decided to help,” he said. Yongama said they knew the pain of needing something and not being able to afford it. They group of 27 former pupils helped a total of 61 schoolkids. “We don’t have a name because we’re not an organisation but a group of caring former pupils,” said Yongama. Luthando Thomas from Masibambisane Stationery sponsored one kid, who’ll receive stationery until he finished school. Teacher Bukelwa Bunu-Nqina thanked the group for the donations.
