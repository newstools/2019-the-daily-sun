FOUR OR Tambo International Airport ‘follow home’ suspects were arrested and one of them was shot and wounded. The four thugs were arrested in Alexandra outside Johannesburg. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said the suspects were allegedly planning a robbery when the SAPS pounced on them as they were changing number plates on their car. However, three suspects managed to flee, initiating a high speed chase and a shootout between the suspects and the police. “The suspect’s vehicle swerved off the road, crashing to a halt,” Naidoo said. These suspects are believed to have been involved in multiple cases of people being followed from the OR Tambo Airport and robbed. Naidoo said the firearms will be sent for ballistic testing to determine if they have been used in the commission of crimes. The National Commissioner of the South African Police Service, General Khehla Sitole lauded the arrest of these suspects.
