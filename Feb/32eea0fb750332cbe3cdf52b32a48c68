THE registration process was disrupted at the Mangosuthu University of Technology. Sasco members blocked the entrance to the university in Umlazi, south of Durban, with burning tyres. They started gathering at 6am and chased other students and staff away from the main gate facing Mangosuthu highway. Traffic was disrupted on the busy highway, which links the kasi to Durban. When the SunTeam approached the protesters, they refused to say what their grievances were. University spokeswoman Mbali Mkhize said they also did not know why Sasco was protesting. SRC leaders from the EFF had said they did not know what Sascoâ€™s grievances were. EFF student command leaders said Sasco members were angry because they were no longer in charge of the SRC. They invited them to meet the EFF to discuss their problems. SRC president Codesa Gwala accused Sasco members of being chaotic and opportunistic. He said as elected student leaders, Sasco was supposed to raise issues with them before protesting. Staff members said they were shocked when they were prevented from entering their offices. No one had informed them there would be a protest. Nehawu leader at the university, Lina Nzama, said Sasco had not told them about a protest and they were not allowed to disrupt staff members.
