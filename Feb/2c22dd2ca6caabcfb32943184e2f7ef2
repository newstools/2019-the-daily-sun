The Democratic Alliance’s Phumzile Van Damme and Helen Zille
seemed to be on different sides. This is after Zille published a column article about the Tax
Revolt. Van Damme responded on Twitter and took shots at Zille. The Western Cape premier Helen, went on Twitter earlier during
the year to announce her intentions to organize a tax revolt. She threatened that if those implicated in the Zondo
Commission of Inquiry into State Campture were not prosecuted, she would
organize a tax revolt. “I’m waiting for the virtue-signalling trolls to get going,”
Zille said in response to online criticism. In response to criticism from the online community, Zille
published an article in which she breaks down research she has conducted over
the topic. Van Damme responded on Twitter and questioned why she did not
encourage citizens to revolt through the ballot box. “I suspected you’d write a column and was expecting you’d
provide some clarity on the valid questions I and many others asked,” she said. “You have not. I also find it odd that nowhere in your column
do you encourage people to use the power of their vote to bring about change.” Van Damme also slammed Zille for “dismissing healthy debate.” “It would be insulting if you dismissed healthy debate and
questions from your colleagues,” she said. “All ideas must be weighed up, thoroughly assessed and
debated.”
