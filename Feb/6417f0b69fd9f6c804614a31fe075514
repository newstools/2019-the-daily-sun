ATTACKS on trade union leaders have sent shock waves across Limpopo. Last year South African Municipal Workers Union leader Patrick Aphane was attacked at his home in Ga-Kgobokwane. Chairman Timson Tshililo was almost killed at his home in Makwarela last Thursday. And as if that was not bad enough, Samwu provincial deputy secretary Ronald Mani was murdered in Tshisahulu, Riverside, yesterday. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said a murder case was opened. Samwu secretary-general Simon Mathe described Maniâ€™s killing as a blow to the union. He said he was convinced all three murders were related, as the men were at forefront of protesting for the removal of mayors who had illegally invested money in VBS.
