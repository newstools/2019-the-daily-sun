THE FAMILY of a model and single mum-of-four are reeling after she was found dead hours after reading a vicious post on her Facebook page. Alli MacDonnell (37) appears to have killed herself on Monday in her Dublin, Ireland home soon after posting a response to this cruel comment on Facebook: "Why is it ok for a man to call a girl a fat ugly c***?????? Seriously new level of pushing someone to the edge." It is unclear who posted the distressing comment. According to the Sun, Alli is survived by her four children, Alex (17), Sara (15), Harry (9) and Siena (2) who she described as her "world" on her Instagram. Alli had enjoyed a long and successful career as a top Irish model. She was also an enthusiastic campaigner for awareness around autism, which is a condition which makes social interaction and communication difficult. Her two kids Harry and Siena both had autism. Last October she wrote: "I’m only human so some days are difficult but I get there and some days I want to crawl into a ball and sleep for a year. "I take each day as it comes and try my best. I work hard and I love my kids with every inch of me. They may have autism but they are healthy and happy and very much loved." Autism Ireland CEO Samantha Judge said she was an "amazing mother" and a tireless campaigner for autism. Best friend John Compton told the Irish Mirror: “We are all beyond devastated. "She was the life and soul and one of the happiest people you would ever meet. She had so much to live for. "She was an amazing mum and a fantastic campaigner for autism. She did such good work.” Cops are not treating her death as suspicious.
