A COUPLE
who tortured their domestic worker in weird and vicious ways are facing jail
time. According
to Todayonline, Linda Seah Lei Sie (39) and husband Lim Toon Leng (44)
from Singapore hired domestic worker Phyu Phyu Mar in February 2016. Mar
looked after the couple’s five-year-old daughter while Sie worked in her beauty
salon and Leng in his interior decorating business. But in
August Mar’s life turned into a nightmare when both Sie and Leng started attacking
her. Among
the horrific treatment Mar had to endure was: - she
was made to drink dirty water mixed with dog hair and floor cleaner. - she
was forced to knock her head hard against the kitchen floor. - twice,
Sie forced her to pour boiling water over her shoulders. Sie then gave her a
needle to pop the blisters caused and refused her medical help. - Sie grabbed
her by the hair so hard that some of it was ripped out. - Sie
regularly klapped her with her cellphone on her head and hands. - Leng
punched her twice on her forehead. - She
was given so little to eat, her weight fell from 50kg to 38kg. During sentencing
on Monday, Sie was judged to be the main torturer and sentenced to three years
in jail. Leng was
sentenced to six weeks in jail. They must
pay Mar S$11,800 (about R122 500) in compensation. District Judge Olivia Low said during sentencing: “By
asking the victim to pour hot water on herself, or telling the victim that the
agency had asked for the victim to knock her head on the floor, Sie hoped to
avoid blame for the injuries suffered by the victim.” The
couple said they will appeal the sentences.
