THE body of a boy who drowned in Umdloti River in Verulam, northern KZN, was recovered on Sunday. Ntandoyenkosi Nzuza (11) from Waterloo drowned on Saturday when he and six friends were crossing a river to get to a soccer match. His gogo, Nonhlanhla Nduku (52), said even though they still could not believe Ntandoyenkosi had drowned, they were grateful to have found his body. “We thank God he was found and his body wasn’t missing any parts. We are grateful that we’ll be able to bury him in a dignified manner,” said the gogo. Nonhlanhla said her grandson loved soccer. She said he and his friends went to the soccer field in Temple Valley every weekend. “They would wait for their coach to pick them up. “The weather was not good on the day he drowned, but they waited for their coach. “After waiting for a while they thought the coach might have passed by earlier. So they decided to use a short-cut to the sports field via a pathway that crosses the river.” She said they discovered the coach had cancelled the match due to bad weather. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was opened at Verulam Police Station.
