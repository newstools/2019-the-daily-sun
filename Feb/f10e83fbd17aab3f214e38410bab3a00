SOCIAL media was buzzing after painter Rasta posted a new photo. Rasta, whose real name is Lebani Sirenje, has now given people even more reason to criticise his art. On Monday, he posted a picture of himself in a cloud of smoke. Social media users decided he never got his paintings right because he was high all the time. He posted the picture with the caption: “Thank you South Africa for giving me LOVE.” But social media users did not show him much love. Mafika Ndengezi wrote: “Now you wanna take nyaope to the next level?” Phakamile Buthelezi said: “Now you’re talking. Put down the brushes and pick up a bong.” Theba Morio wrote: “Rasta’s zol is the reason he can’t do his paintings right.” But others did show him love. Lusanda Shoota Sipaka wrote: “Respect the rasta man because he’s the only one left in Jah’s creation. Nobody can stop your drawing.” Phindile Dlamini said: “You show us anything is possible if you see it in your own eyes. F%$# what everyone says.” Rasta recently was slammed after announcing he would open a drawing school.
