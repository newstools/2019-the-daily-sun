IT’S been a year since five cops were gunned down, and their families are finding it hard to come to terms. The cops were murdered while on duty in Ngcobo, west of Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape. Tears flowed yesterday during the commemoration of Warrant Officer Zuko Mbini (45), Constables Zuko Ntsheku (38), Nkosiphendule Pongco (32), Sibongiseni Sandlana (32) and Kuhle Metete (27) as families laid wreaths for them. Nkosiphendule’s sister Nowinti said things were bad at home since her brother’s death. “He was sent to school with money my mother made from selling fruit.” Sergeant Mzonke Joxo of the South African Police Union called for harsh sentences for the six accused. “Our courts must show no mercy to police killers,” he said. Police Minister Bheki Cele said amaberete will come to Ngcobo next month to clean up the streets. “Killing a cop is different from stealing bread,” he said. “We thank the families. This is your time to walk tall. Cops have human rights that you must defend.” The suspects will appear in the Mthatha High Court in April. A surveillance system, electric fence, new gate and other safety measures were put in place at the cop shop.
