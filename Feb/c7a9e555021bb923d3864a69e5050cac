The Mpumalanga Department of Agriculture has warned residents about a job scam doing the rounds. The scam claims that the department has a one-year-contract for a learnership programme in agricultural science. According to the department’s head, Lucky Monareng, there’s a poster circulating on social media offering a monthly stipend of R5 500. Those interested are asked to secure it with at least R1 500. “It has come to our attention that some of the potential victims have been told to pay an amount of R1 500 to guarantee their place in the programme. Such a request for payment has no basis because no money is needed to qualify for any place in a government programme. “This is pure criminality committed by people who prey on our desperate, unemployed youth,” warned Monareng. “We’re not sure how many people have fallen victim to this, but as a department, we can categorically say it is a scam.”
