ANGRY residents vowed that the burning of thugs won’t end until crime in their area stops completely. Two men were stoned and burned to death at Shukushukuma squatter camp in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, on Thursday night. They were accused of raping and killing a 60-year-old gogo. The gogo lived alone in the area. Her body was found on Thursday morning by neighbours. A resident said Shukushukuma is dangerous. “Criminals terrorise us. “We will continue burning criminals until they stop terrorising us.” Mava Fundakubi (52) was killed in the same area last month after being falsely accused of sexually abusing a seven-year-old kid. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the family of Andile Mtana (23) told cops he had been kidnapped with another man from a home in Mtanezulu Street, NU11, Motherwell and taken to Shukushukuma. “On Thursday night they found Andile’s burning body and on Friday morning discovered the body of the second man,” Beegte told the People’s Paper. “The men’s hands were tied with wire and were burned to death. “The second man’s identity has not yet been confirmed.” At an awareness imbizo on Tuesday night at the NU30 community hall in Motherwell, Major-General Dawie Rabie condemned vigilante killings. Captain Beetge urged anyone with information about the incident to call Detective-Warrant Officer Kaya Makaula on 071 687 1976.
