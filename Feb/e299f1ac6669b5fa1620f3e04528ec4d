NTANDAZO Mdutywa said it took only eight days of using an evil sangoma’s muthi before he was robbed. “I was robbed of R130 000,” said Ntandazo from Snake Park in Sasolburg. The 33-year-old told Daily Sun the foreigner was renting a backyard shack in Angola, Sasolburg. “He gave me muthi to use for eight days,” he said. “But when he went back on the ninth day the sangoma talked about money. I wasn’t thinking straight.” He said he gave the sangoma all his money, which was R130 000. But the very next day the sangoma was gone. The landlord told Ntandazo the sangoma had packed his bags and left. “I need to find this guy. That money was supposed to help my kids.” He said cops won’t help him as he gave away the money willingly. Bongani Nkosi (40) told Daily Sun he was scammed of R150 000. “I used his muthi for six days and borrowed money from the bank to give to him. Next thing he was gone.” Nomsa Shabalala (36) said she was tricked into giving away her savings to the sangoma. Landlord Thapelo Mdima said many people had come looking for the sangoma.
