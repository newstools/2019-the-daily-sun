CAPE Town City chairman, John Comitis, has warned that Teko Modise and Thami Mkhize are going nowhere. There’s been reports that the players contracts expire in June, but Comitis has rubbished such talks. “They’ll both be here next season, because they have contracts,’’ Comitis said. Mkhize has won two trophies since he joined the club – the Telkom Knockout in 2016 and the 2018 MTN8. Mkhize joined City in 2016. Modise, one of the best ball players in over a decade in the league with two PSL Footballer of Season awards, joined City in 2017 after he left Mamelodi Sundowns. The 36-year-old looks revived and his range of passing has been a reminiscent of his time at Pirates where he was at his pick of prowess.
