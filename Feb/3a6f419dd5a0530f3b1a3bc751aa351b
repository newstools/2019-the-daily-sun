Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has applauded youngster Happy Mashiane for his seamless transition into the first team. The young full-back, who has been seeing regular action, has already become a fan favourite during his short time at Amakhosi. He has not looked out of place since his promotion to the first team in January. Middendorp has been hugely impressed by the 21-year-old and is expecting much more from him in the near future. “I kept hearing his name a lot from our MDC coach Arthur Zwane,” said Middendorp. “I decided to follow up on it and I was very impressed with him. Of course he still has a lot to learn but he is showing good signs." Middendorp said it is important, however, to manage the youngster well. The German tactician substituted Mashiane at half time during the Soweto derby, a decision that many fans struggled to understand. "You have to be careful in a game like that," Middendorp explained. "While you want these youngsters to play and gain experience, you also don't want to overdo it and push them too hard." Mashiane is set to be given another start on Sunday when Amakhosi travel to Port Elizabeth to face The Magic FC in the Nedbank Cup Last 16. They will be looking to avoid the mother of all upsets against the lowly ABC Motsepe League outfit and go a step closer to ending their three season long trophy less spell.
