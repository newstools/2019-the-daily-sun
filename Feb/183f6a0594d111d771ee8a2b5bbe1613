THE pastor from Seshego in Polokwane who is facing several charges, including fraud, was refused bail in the Seshego Magistrates Court. He appeared with five other suspects on Tuesday. They will remain behind bars until Monday for pending cases to be checked. The 57-year-old pastor faces charges of fraud and assault, concealment of death, kidnapping and extortion. He and his five accomplices were investigated by the police after church members opened cases against them. The six accused allegedly assaulted congregants severely during church services when they failed to make tithes or offerings. The five co-accused are charged with fraud and assault. The pastor is also accused of extortion of large amounts of money from recently retired pensioners. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed that more than 40 cases of rape and assault were still being investigated. Allegations of concealment of death of some congregants have also been made. “The pastor will appear in the Mankweng Magistrates Court on two counts of rape allegedly committed in Polokwane in 2012. “ The rape victims were 14 and 16 but he was released from police cells on bail of R2 000,” said Mojapelo. He said police investigations were continuing and more arrests and charges were possible. A former church member said he was not surprised the pastor was bust because of his evil ways.
