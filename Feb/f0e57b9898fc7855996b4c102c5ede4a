THE tide of legalising dagga in countries around the
world has led to amazing new ways of growing the weed, with some operations
even coming up with different flavoured zol. “Boutique” growers in America sell a gram of dagga for as
much as $1 000 (about R14 000)! There are literally thousands of varieties of dagga. They
include such wild sounding flavours such as Vanilla Kush, Sunset Sherbet,
Wedding Cake, Papaya and Strawberry Banana. There are two species of zol, which both have different
qualities: - Sativa cannabis:
This gives the smoker a more energetic buzz because it contains more of the
psychoactive compound THC. - Indica cannabis:
This is the kind of weed that leads to that dopey feeling and getting stuck
on the couch (or “couch-lock” as some smokers call it). It has higher levels of
CBD, which helps the body and mind relax. Growers play around with the plant’s environment to see
what genetics are triggered, as well as crossbreeding between species and
plants to create hybrids. Dr Machel Emanuel, horticulturalist and principal
investigator at the Life Science Cannabis Research Group at The University of
the West Indies, told the Jamaican Gleaner: “Consumers are not leaving their
euphoria to chance, they want to predict it. And it’s being done based on the
classification of these popular strains.” Growers are increasingly paying attention to something
called “terpenes” that are responsible for the flavour and smell of ganja.
Playing around with different combinations through crossbreeding produces
flavours and smells which are then given a brand name. Josiah Halley, a master cultivator, told Jamaican
Gleaner: “It’s the same effect that makes you want to buy a Louis Vuitton or
Gucci. It’s a status symbol, and there is brand recognition. And besides, why
would you not want to have extremely tasty herb? The trend shows that these
flavourful varieties are going to become more popular.”
