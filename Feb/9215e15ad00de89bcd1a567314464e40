WHEN a woman was found murdered and her ears cut off, angry residents started pointing fingers at Basotho illegal miners. The residents torched many of their shacks and the illegal miners retaliated by attacking residents. Cops had to intervene as miners and residents at Soul City in Kagiso, Mogale City, battled it out. But it was later found the woman was allegedly killed by her boyfriend, who dumped her body in the veld. The body was discovered by cops on Tuesday near the squatter camp. “Our members received a report of murder while patrolling in sector 5. “We found people gathered around the body of a woman lying on the ground. “The victim had open wounds on her chin and on her upper arm. Her ears had been cut off.” Sibiya said a serious confrontation occurred between residents and the illegal miners, and cops had to call for backup. “The illegal miners allegedly opened fire on them.” Two suspects aged between 19 and 25 were arrested for unlawful possession of ammunition. The dead woman’s boyfriend was charged with murder. Sibiya said the murder suspect and two men had appeared in court and will appear again soon.
