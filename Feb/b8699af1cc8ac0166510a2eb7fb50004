POLICE are meant to fight crime. But a cop took on the role of a midwife on Sunday! Constable Colleta Puggens delivered a baby at the Gravelotte cop shop in Limpopo. She was about to leave the station in the morning when a pregnant woman rushed in and asked for an ambulance. “The officer contacted the ambulance, but with the nearest hospital some 45km away from the station, the constable worried that the woman was in labour,” said cops. Puggens asked gogo Morongwe Mashumo, who lives next to the station, to help her. Puggens said she was happy she helped bring baby girl Nyiko, meaning gift in Tsonga, into the world. “The priority was to ensure both the mother and child are healthy.”
