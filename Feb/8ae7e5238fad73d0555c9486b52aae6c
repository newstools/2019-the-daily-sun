SIBUSISO Tede said Home Affairs is stopping his life from going forward. The 20-year-old from Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, applied for his ID in 2017, but can’t get his application accepted. He told Daily Sun he has been to Home Affairs several times in an attempt to apply for an ID, but has always been turned away because his mum is not available. “My dad has tried to explain to officials that my mum has not been part of my life since I was three years old, but they told him to do paternity tests,” said Sibusiso. “They told me I should do DNA tests if I wanted to apply using only my father’s documents and we went for the tests. I got the results after 21 days confirming that I was his child.” They sent in all the documents yet he received an SMS saying some were still outstanding . Sibusiso returned to Home Affairs and since then, he is always told his application is being looked into. He said he lost out on a bursary because he didn’t have an ID. “I need to get my ID so I can continue with my future,” said Sibusiso. Spokesman for Home Affairs, Thabo Mokgola, said an official will be assigned to follow up on the case.
