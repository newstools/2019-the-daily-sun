KASI residents are finding creative ways to find shelter and make money. Residents of Joe Slovo in Milnerton have built double-storey shacks to rent. Landlord Zwelungile Ndaka (36): “I live downstairs and I have a tenant upstairs. “I couldn’t build another shack next to this one because there isn’t enough space.” Zwelungile said he built his double-storey shack two years ago. “It took me about two weeks to build the shack upstairs, but it was worth it because I got a person to occupy it as soon as it was done.” Tenant Norman Ndunde (29) said tsotsis don’t steal from their shacks because they fear they might get caught. “We live upstairs. “If someone tries to break in they will be seen by pedestrians and the people downstairs. “I used to live in a shack downstairs and I had to stop buying TVs because thugs kept stealing them. “But since I moved upstairs I haven’t had that problem,” said Norman. Nolizwi Mpungose (45) said her double-storey was built by her late husband. “Every month I get a bit of money from renting out this shack,” she said. The landlords told the SunTeam prospective tenants come to their shacks every month asking if they have a place for them.
