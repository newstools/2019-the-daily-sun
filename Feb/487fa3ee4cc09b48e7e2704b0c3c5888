CASTER Semenya has written a letter to her followers warning
them of a scam in her name! The world champion athlete said she has learnt about a
petition to support her, but which is asking for a sign-up donation of money. “I have no knowledge of and have no affiliation to this
petition, and it has not been sanctioned by me. I will not be receiving any of
these funds and donors are advised accordingly,” she said. The athlete said she was grateful for all the local and
global support she has received. She said she has also learnt of an article published on
Times Live that claimed government has paid R25m towards her case. She said she had no knowledge of what was paid by government
for her legal and medical team. “My personal representation has been funded mainly by
private funders. The portion funded by government is a fraction of what was
quoted in the article.” Caster is appearing in the Court of Arbitration for Sport,
appealing a proposed rule by the IAAF.
