SEVEN more bodies were apparently recovered from the Gloria Coal Mine near Middleburg, Mpumalanga yesterday. This brings to 12 the number of people who have died since they were trapped after a gas explosion occurred on 3 February. It was allegedly after more than 20 illegal miners tried to steal copper cables. The rescue operation resumed on Wednesday after police were sent to ensure that there were no disruptions. But the team had to be recalled because the methane gas levels were too high for the team to continue working. Workers previously indicated that they were not happy that the rescue operations had resumed without the workers being paid. “We don’t feel any pity for thieves who took advantage that the mine was not operating when the workers have not been paid,” Amanda Mdodana, a workers’ representative, said. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said they have received information about seven more people who were discovered but mine management had still not communicated the exact figure to police.
