ALTHOUGH Naledi Gootsch studied civil engineering, she had found herself in a completely different career. The 22-year-old from Cape Town is the founder of Ledi Craft Gin. She said: “My gin is made out of fruit. It’s a mix of strawberry, raspberries and pineapple. “The alcohol base is cane spirits, which I then put into a machine to mix with juniper berries and spices. Flavour is also added in the evaporation cylinders. “As the alcohol evaporates, it picks up the flavours. When it’s done, it’s between 90% and 95% alcohol, and the percentage is reduced by adding spring water. “It’s then mixed with strawberries, raspberries or pineapple to get that fruity flavour.” Naledi said the gin was healthy and was available in Joburg, Tshwane and the Western Cape. She said she believed she’d be successful in the industry because her idead was unique.
