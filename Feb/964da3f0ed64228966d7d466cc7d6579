WORRY hit parents hard at Hoerskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark as scores of emergency services cleared the scenes. This follows the collapse of a walk way at the school, injuring over 20 pupils and killing three pupils. Dozens of emergency services have been at the school trying remove bodies on the scene. “The screams of the learners trapped under rubles still linger in my head.” These are the words of a worker at the school who heard the walk way collapse while warming her food. This is after a walk way collapsed and killed three pupils at Hoerskool Drihoek, leaving 26 affected. Speaking to Daily Sun, the woman who refused to be named said she will not sleep after what she saw today. "I heard a loud bang and thought it was a ceiling board falling over my children. Only when I got outside, I saw scores of learners lying on the side of the fallen walk way. The deceased were still trapped under rubble, “she said. According to the woman, she claimed that last week a teacher collapsed in the classroom while teaching. "If this happened in a black school, one would claim that the school is hit by witchcraft,” she said. The school has been shut down with immediate effect. Education MEC Panyaza Lusufi said they are giving counseling to the teachers and will further do that for learners. Panyaza said "It’s a sad day that no one expected it. "We didn't plan such a disaster. We thank everyone who responded swiftly and assisted to rescue the learner," he said. Panyaza said amongst the deceased pupils, two were male. "We are trying to locate the families of the two deceased learners,” he said.
