City Power Spokesperson Isaac Mangena has issued a warning to
residents about criminals gaining access to people’s home by posing as
officials. People from Joburg suburbs have been complaining on social
media about one particular individual who has hit several suburbs in Randburg,
the CBD and even in the East of Johannesburg. The person reportedly knocks and introduces himself, showing
you some identification that looks like it is from the said department. The man allegedly always has a walkie talkie and a reflector
jacket in some instances, he even goes as far as making “work” related phone
calls. City Power Spokesperson Isaac Mangena said they are aware of
the fake officials. Mangena says City Power’s Security Risk Team has notified
the police about them. “This case first came to the fore in October 2018 and police
were given a statement that the card he uses is fake and the individual is not
contracted to City Power and therefore is not an employee of City Power,”
Mangena said. Mangena said that they are engaging the police to find out
why these individuals are still roaming the streets. He urged customers to be vigilant and insist on verifying
people coming into their property claiming to be from City Power. “The people should show the card, should also have a car
marked with the City Power logo. They normally would not be alone. Customers should call City Power Security Control Room on
0114 907900/11 before allowing someone to enter their premises,” Mangena said.
