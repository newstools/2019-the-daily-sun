THE South African Weather Service has issued a severe weather warning for the next few days for the Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng and the Northern Cape. In the Northern Cape, Oudtshoorn Municipality said it would seek assistance from the Western Cape government as heavy rain and high winds resulted in many homes being destroyed and electrical poles uprooted. The southern Free State as well as parts of the Eastern Cape were also hit by heavy rain. The Weather Service issued a warning of heavy rain and flash floods expected in Limpopo and Mpumalanga. The Northern Cape could experience veld fires, while severe storms are expected in Joburg from Wednesday. On Saturday KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance, Nomsa Dube-Ncube, visited areas in Ladysmith where families were left with nowhere to go. She said they will do everything in their power to help affected families. Some of the families had already been evacuated and were staying in a community hall. Zibonele Makhathini (44) said his family was all at home when it started raining. “Before we knew it, the zinc roof was blowing off and the walls were falling in. We ran for our lives and hid in other rooms,” said Zibonele.
