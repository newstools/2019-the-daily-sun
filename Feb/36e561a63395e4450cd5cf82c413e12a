NEW Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela helped out in the 10111 call centre on Friday. However, he got a shock when he had to deal with dropped calls, police not responding to their radios and rude callers. Not knowing he was talking to the commissioner, one caller even told Mawela to voetsak! During his visit to the 10111 headquarters in Midrand, Joburg, Mawela said he saluted the call centre operators as they worked under enormous pressure. His visit came after a number of complaints from the public that the centre was not functioning properly. Mawela said: “We are here to understand challenges faced by both operators and community members. We want to fully understand their frustrations. I salute the workers who put up with a lot after waking up early in the morning to be here at 6am.” He said he called the station commander of a cop who failed to respond to his radio. “If they don’t pick up, it creates a backlog. I would also like to appeal to community members only to call the line if it’s absolutely necessary,” said Mawela. Call dispatcher Lindiwe Gama said they received all kinds of calls, including people complaining about burst water pipes. “At times, it is difficult if police do not respond to their radios or if a caller keeps quiet after phoning in, because we cannot hang up,” she said.
