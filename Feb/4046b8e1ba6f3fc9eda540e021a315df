businessman  Bulelani Mancotywa was driven by his passion to help others. The 30-year-old former teacher from Ngqeleni started his business, Khiwa Media Company, in 2015 while he was studying education at the Walter Sisulu University. He said he worked as a teacher for two years and recently resigned to focus on his business. He said he’s always had a passion for producing, photography and videography. He is glad his passion had created jobs for five talented youths from Mthatha and surrounding areas. He said he was proud that two of them had opened their own businesses. “I taught them the importance of being independent. I motivated them to open their own companies. We compete in the same industry.” Last year gospel star Hlengiwe Mhlaba contacted Bulelani after watching his music videos on his Facebook page. Hlengiwe travelled with Bulelani to East London to shoot a music video for her at the end of last year. He said Hlengiwe believed in him so much that she bought him a new Macbook pro desktop computer worth R30 000 and video lights worth R8 000.
