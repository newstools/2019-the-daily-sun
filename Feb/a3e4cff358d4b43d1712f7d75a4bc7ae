Touch was talking to his fans on social media this morning, making sure they go into the weekend with his words of wisdom on their minds. “What’s inside of you is far greater than what you’re pursuing on the outside. Don’t open your legs for a job when God is building a company out of you! You’re more than what you’re chasing,” he told them.
