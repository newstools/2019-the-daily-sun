Ringworm can be pretty annoying. It will cause your skin to itch and flake, which is irritating and unsightly. Ringworm is common in children, but adults can get it too. The skin condition is caused by a keratin-eating fungus and its name comes from the ring-like appearance of the rash. Ringworm can be picked up pretty much anywhere as the fungus is highly contagious. There are various anti-bacterial and anti-fungal creams that you can use to tackle ringworm, but if you want to try something more natural and home-made, there are some great home remedies you can try.
