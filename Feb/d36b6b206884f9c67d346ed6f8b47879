An awaiting-trial prisoner hanged himself in a cell on Thursday. Hillbrow Police Station has appealed to the family of Tailor Roberts (48) to come forward and identify his body. Roberts was found hanging from a toilet window at Hillbrow Police Station on Thursday afternoon. The incident happened while he and other inmates were waiting to be transported back to Joburg Prison. He had just appeared in the Hillbrow Magistrates Court for possession of drugs. His case was postponed to Thursday. Police spokesman Captain Musa Shihambe said Roberts’ body was found by an officer who was doing a roll call for the suspects to be transported to prison. Shihambe said: “He was served lunch with other prisoners at 1pm. “Just before 1.30pm, one of the officers started doing a roll call for the suspects to be transported to prison. “One suspect could not be accounted for and an officer went to look for him.” Shihambe said Tailor used his bag handle to hang himself.
