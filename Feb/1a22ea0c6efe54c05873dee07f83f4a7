THE thought of Mamelodi Sundowns sitting on top of the log sends shivers down the spine of Gavin Hunt. For the longest time, the Bidvest Wits coach has downplayed his side’s chances of success in the Absa Premiership, punting the likes of Sundowns and Orlando Pirates to claim the R10 million prize cheque. But behind Hunt’s cool demeanour, lies the fear that Downs might actually topple the Students and open a good lead with the three games they have in hand. With 10 games to go, the trio – Wits, Sundowns and Pirates – have emerged as leading contenders for the league Holy Grail. Yet, it’s still early to tell who will emerge victorious in what is shaping up to be a three-horse race. And more twists and turns could be expected in the final straight, not least with both Sundowns and Bucs also involved in the taxing Caf Champions League. Back from African Champions League duties, Sundowns resume their domestic campaign with a home fixture against Polokwane City at Loftus Versfeld tonight (7.30pm). “We should not get carried away, but remain focused on the task at hand,” says Sundowns player Tiyani Mabunda. “It’s an important game and the duty is on us to go out there and execute the plan.”
