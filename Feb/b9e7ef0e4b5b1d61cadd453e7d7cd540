AMAJITA ended their U-20 Africa Cup of Nations campaign on a high after beating Nigeria 5-3 on penalties. The sides played out to a goalless draw after 90 minutes at the Stade General Seyni Kountche in Niamey on Saturday and penalties were needed to separate the sides. Amajita scored all five of their penalties while goalkeeper Khulekani Kubheka saved Adamu Ibrahim Alhassan’s penalty to give his side victory. Thabo Senong's charges finish third at the tournament behind Mali and Senegal who will contest today’s final. The third place finish is Amajita’s second highest, following their second place finish in 1997. They finished fourth two years ago in Zambia, losing to Guinea in the third place playoff then. In the final game, Senong gave a run to some of the players who had not played in the other games. Midfielder Simphiwe Ncamani and defender Molebogeng Modise made their first appearances in the tournament. Midfielder Luvuyo Phewa and striker Bayanda Shangase also got some valuable minutes. Amajita will return having achieved their goal of qualifying for the FIFA U-20 World Cup set to be staged in Poland in May.
