An intelligence-driven
operation by Ekurhuleni East cops, led to the arrest of three men and a woman
in Kwa-Thema and Tsakane. The suspects were found in
possession of a shot gun and an R-5 rifle with ammunition.  Almost two weeks ago on 14
February 2019, police foiled a possible robbery at a chainstore in Tsakane, and
recovered two firearms (pistols) later reported to have been robbed from two
police officers the previous day.  It is reported that an R-5
rifle had also been taken during that robbery.  A week post his redeployment
to Gauteng as Provincial Commissioner of police, Lieutenant General Elias
Mawela on 15 February 2019 called for a priority investigation towards the
recovery of the remaining R-5.  Information led police to
Kwa-Thema where the first suspect was arrested and a shot gun recovered, which
has been confirmed as also having been taken during a business robbery on 09
February 2019 in Kwa-Thema.  Further investigation led the
police to Tsakane where they arrested two male suspects and one female suspect.  Gauteng Police spokesman
Captain Mavela Masondo told the Sun Team that they recovered an unloaded R-5
that has since been confirmed as the one being sought.  “We also found ammunition,”
he said.  He said that the further
investigations will be conducted by police to determine whether the arrested
suspects are linked to the robberies of the 9th and 13th this month and for
possible linkage to other serious and violent crimes in Ekurhuleni and surrounding
areas.  “Police will not rest until
serious and violent crimes become a thing of the past. This starts with
removing illegal firearms from the wrong hands, thus sparing the lives of
innocent law abiding residents and visitors of the Province,” said Masondo
