JOMO Cosmos’ win against Baroka FC is seen as a big achievement by owner-coach, Jomo Sono. He believes this could be used as a yardstick, as they fight for their way back to the PSL. Qualifying for the Nedbank Cup last 16 stage is something that Sono has always wanted, and they did this in style by shuttering dreams of the reigning Telkom Knockout kings, Baroka FC, with Inky Masuku’s solitary goal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Cosmos have been struggling in the NFD where they have suffered three consecutive league defeats to Maccabi FC, Ajax Cape Town and TS Sporting. But now the former Bafana Bafana mentor believes this victory is the tonic that his charges needed to turn things around in the NFD. “I believe the confidence is also back going to our league matches,” said Sono. “Baroka believed my mind games before the match. I said we can’t beat Baroka and they believed me. But I knew we can beat them.” He said he will be happy to draw Kaizer Chiefs in the last 16 draw scheduled for tonight. “We fancy our chances in this tournament. Some big teams like Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns are out. “But the league is important to us. “Black Leopards were 13th this time in the NFD last season and they went all the way to the promotional play-offs and won promotion,” said Sono. “I believe we can do it and make it to the play-offs too. I can see the confidence and the believe from the boys. I miss the PSL and the PSL misses me.” Baroka head coach, Wedson Nyirenda, says elementary mistakes cost them the last 16 stage of this competition. “We dominated the game but failed to do the right thing,” said Nyirenda. Ezenkosi, whose next game is against Mbombela United at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday afternoon, are 12th on the NFD log with 20 points.
