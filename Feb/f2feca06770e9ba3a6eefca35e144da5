MICHAEL Khupe has been waiting for an ID for a long time. The 34-year-old from Lethabong, North West, first applied for an ID in 2004 so he could write his final matric exams. But he never got the ID and was forced to use his birth certificate. When he visited the local Home Affairs, he was told the ID was delivered to the Joburg Home Affairs. Michael was shocked to hear that someone had already collected the ID. “I’ve been to the local Home Affairs offices several times, but was told to apply again. “I was later told my ID number was duplicated and someone has been issued the same number. “Officials said they’d investigate and cancel the other number, but nothing happened. I need my ID.” Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said: “The matter has been referred to the relevant unit at head office for investigation. An official will contact the client.”
