Mikateko Hlabangwane is a friend you want to keep. She said real friends are like family because they’re there for each other. The 20-year-old from Tshwane, who plays Mary Maswanganyi in Scandal!, said her character is the girl parents want their kids to be friends with. “She’s smart and always says the right thing.” Mikateko joined the soapie as a teenager in 2014. “When I started, Mary was in the same grade as I. She now is a second-year student, while I’m doing my second year in civil engineering.” Mikateko said she wants to follow in her engineer aunt Kurisani Mashele’s footsteps. “At school, my drama teacher realised my talent and found me an agency, which led to me portraying Mary.” In the storyline, Mary is working at a club as a hostess. “Mary’s aim at the club is to break through to high- profile people.” She said she’d never worked at a club but knew girls there who hope to meet the right people to survive. “Girls shouldn’t sell themselves. I was raised to prioritise education.” The talented actress said her role has taught her that nobody’s perfect. “Mary tries too hard. That’s why she nearly committed suicide after a party video went viral.” Mikateko said loving yourself is important. “Value yourself so you don’t choose a path to your downfall.” She said God has led her on her path. “Acting is the fresh air I breathe.”
