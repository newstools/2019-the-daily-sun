WHEN paramedics arrived at the scene in Vereeniging, south of Joburg yesterday morning, they found passengers climbing out of a bus. Over 40 passengers were left injured when the minibus they were travelling in veered off the road and over a small embankment at the Houtkop and Waterdal intersection. ER24 paramedics said they arrived on the scene just before 8am. Paramedics assessed the patients and found that 43 people had sustained minor to moderate injuries. The patients were treated and some were taken to nearby hospitals for further treatment. Details surrounding the accidents are still to be established. Later that morning, a truck and car collided head-on, leaving four people injured south of Ladysmith.
