JACK Bloom says 17 Life Esidimeni patients are still missing. The DA’s Gauteng shadow health MEC said this came out on Tuesday in a reply to a question he asked Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa in the Legislature. “The MEC said four of the missing patients were recently tracked with the assistance of Home Affairs, which reduces the number of those unaccounted for to 17, down from 21 a few months ago,” he said. “She insisted her department was doing that it could to find the remaining patients and there were ‘no delays whatsoever’.” He said he was unconvinced the department had done everything it could to find the patients quickly. “According to the MEC, they are only now planning to go back to Life Esidimeni to check the ID numbers and names of patients. Why wasn’t this done before?” Bloom said he doubted all the missing patients would be accounted for at this stage. “Many are probably dead, adding to the 144 other patients who died as a result of the arrogance, cruelty and corruption that caused the Esidimeni horror.” On Tuesday, the DA said 365 claimants were still waiting for the compensation determined by former deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke’s arbitration ruling.
