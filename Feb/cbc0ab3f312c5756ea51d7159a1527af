THEY thought they had scored big but their happiness did not last very long! Cops who were patrolling in the CBD of Welkom were alerted to the robbery and they spotted the four suspects walking around the area. The men were searched and stolen items worth R50 600 were recovered. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “Four suspects aged between 24 and 41 were arrested and charged with possession of stolen property.” He said cops received a message to be on the look-out for men in the CBD who had stolen items from the clothing shop in Mooi Street. “They drove to Mooi Street and saw four men in the area. They searched them and found some of the stolen items. Further investigations led to the recovery of more stolen items hidden opposite the old Liberty Centre.” Thakeng said an Acer computer, speed point, clothes and bags were confiscated. The suspects are expected to appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court soon.
