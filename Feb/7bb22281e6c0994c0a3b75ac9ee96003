THEIR friendship was built on trust, but the friends are now fighting! According to James Sithole (41) from Mabopane, north of Tshwane, their friendship ended when Saul Nkosi (48) cheated him out of his home. James said he asked his friend to guard his shack as he was working in Botswana. He said he agreed, and when he came back and wanted to sell the shack and the stand, Saul offered to buy it. He said they agreed he would give him R70 000 for the shack. “He gave me R9 000 and told me he would give me the rest later, but he never did. Instead he told me I should pay him R20 000 if I wanted him to move out,” said James. Saul agreed that he said he would buy the house, but later changed his mind after seeing that it was in an undeveloped area. “I also learnt that James had no right to sell the house because it didn’t belong to him,” said Saul. “He needs to stop harassing me because I am not moving out.”
