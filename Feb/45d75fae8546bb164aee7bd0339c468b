“I LOVE you, mum. I love you, Omphemetse. Please forgive me for what I’m about to do and don’t blame yourselves.” This was what Omphile Motlane (19) wrote in a letter to his brother Omphemetse (12) and mum Thoko Zwane (45) before he disappeared without a trace last Monday. Thoko said she was still shocked by the letter and didn’t understand why Omphile had left home in Danville, Tshwane. “He left to go to school in the morning, but when I returned home he wasn’t here.” Thoko said she feared her son had left a suicide letter. She said Omphile had been having a difficult time since his father died in 2016 and was always home alone. Thoko said Omphile once told his brother he didn’t want to live because he was suffering. “Every morning, I hope to hear my son knocking at the door.” Thoko said Omphile had abused drugs in the past and she wasn’t sure if he’d started using again. She said he didn’t attend school last year. Constable Sibongile Vuma said a missing person’s case was opened. Omphile was last seen wearing grey tracksuit pants and a black top. He has razor scars on his arms and body. If you have seen Omphile, call Daily Sun’s offices.
