THREE weeks after the body of Zintle Marikeni (26) was exhumed, her worried family have still not heard from the police. Zintle was buried on 26 January at the Sunny South Cemetery, East London, after her death on 9 January. When her stepfather Koki Ramakatsi (64) went to the grave the following morning, the grave had been tampered with. Zintle’s body was exhumed and, according to the family, her head, heart, left hand, left foot, breasts and vagina were missing. The corpse was taken by police for DNA tests. Since then the body has not come back and her family are worried. Community leader Thandile Mtikitiki said: “It is not a right for a grave to remain open. We are scared that children and livestock could fall in the grave and be harmed.” Zintle’s mother Lulama Marikeni (49) said they will go to the police today. Police spokeswoman Captain Hazel Mqala said: “We ask the family to be patient. We are still busy with the investigation.”
