Young actor, Nkokheli Oros Mampofu and his fiancé, Bianca Carmichael have welcomed their little baby girl into the world. The young celebrity couple announced their pregnancy just a month ago having kept it a secret (as is the case with most things in their relationship) for the first eight months. “The greatest pleasure afforded to me in life to this day has been coming to the reality that I could gift life onto this earth. It’s still feels exciting & unreal to me but beyond all else, my greatest gratitude has been affording myself and Bianca the opportunity to take this first experience of having a child in and being fully here,” Oros said in a statement at the time. A few days later, the couple then revealed that they would be having a girl, much to delight of their adoring fans.

The couple hasn’t said too much on their first few days as parents nor have they released pictures of the baby’s face yet, but they did confirm that their daughter had been born. “Thank You God,” said Oros while the only thing his baby momma Bianca has said is “I already can’t imagine my world without her”. Congratulations to the happy couple. OROS: I’M SO PROUD OF MYSELF THANK YOU GOD.. A post shared by  Oros Mampofu (@oros_mampofu) on Feb 23, 2019 at 11:43pm PST  11 days feels like a lifetime ????????
