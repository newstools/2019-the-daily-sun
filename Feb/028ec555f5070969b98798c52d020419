SHE had just returned to her rented room when her landord attacked her. And it all started over a satellite dish! Matshidiso Boikanyo’s landlord told her the satellite dish was installed too low and should be moved higher. Matshidiso (34) told him she did not have money and would do it when she got paid. The incident occurred in Mabele-a-Podi, outside Rustenburg in North West. The angry landlord allegedly said Matshidiso was not co-operative. All she remembers is that she was lying on the ground and kicks were raining down on her. “He provoked me. Did he expect me to say nothing? I could see he was in a bad mood when he approached me, but I didn’t think it would end up this way,” said Matshidiso. Four men who witnessed the attack said Matshidiso deserved the beating because she seemed rude to her landlord. But Matshidiso wants justice. According to her, her landlord undermines his tenants and calls them names. North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh confirmed that a case of assault was opened. The suspect will appear in court on 4 March.
