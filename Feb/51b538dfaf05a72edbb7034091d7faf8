A MAN who found a unique and very public way of
confronting his partner for “cheating” has set social media alight. A photo of the man, standing in the airport in Melbourne,
Australia with a huge sign saying “I KNOW YOU CHEATED” was posted on Twitter last
Wednesday by twitter user Krystal. He was apparently waiting for the “cheater” to come
through the airport. The thread has been retweeted 25 000 and given 75 000
likes so far.
