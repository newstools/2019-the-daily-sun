RICHARD Maphita (51) was threatened with death, but he never backed down. His house was torched, but he said he won’t stop fighting for his village. Richard and his wife survived death when their house was set alight in Ha-Muila Village, Limpopo, on Saturday. Maphita is the chairman of Muila Forum. He said the threats came after they marched to Doornhoek mine to hand over a memorandum of grievances. “People became angry when the mine gave feedback by presenting false mining documentation,” he said. “Villagers stopped trucks from going to the mine and barricaded roads. We don’t have a proper water supply and roads, but the mine continues to make money from our land. The mine doesn’t care about us.” Richard said he was ready to die for the liberation of the villagers. He said officials from the mineral resources department will meet the villagers today. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed a case of arson and malicious damage to property was opened. “No arrests have been made,” said Ngoepe.
