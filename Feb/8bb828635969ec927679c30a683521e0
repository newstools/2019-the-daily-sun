IT’S THAT time of the year when villagers enjoy drinking traditional morula beer. But gogo Ena Mashele has a stern warning for men who drink the beer every weekend: use condoms when sleeping with your women to avoid unplanned pregnancies. The 76-year old from Makhushane Village outside Phalaborwa, in Limpopo said most men in her village like the traditional drink because it’s like a service kit. “It cleanses the manhood system and makes their 4-5s strong all the time. It makes the demand for sex very high. We want planned babies, so men who drink this beer regularly should use condoms.” Gogo said women enjoy this time of year, because men are like machines in bed. She learnt to make morula beer when she grew up, as her parents sold it. “They used to call us to help and that’s when I learnt how to make it.” Gogo said if the beer is not sold straight after preparation, the alcohol content rises. She said the demand was very high and she sold over 40 two-litre containers of beer every day. “I am happy people are still proud of drinking this traditional beer, which helps our tradition grow from one generation to another.”
