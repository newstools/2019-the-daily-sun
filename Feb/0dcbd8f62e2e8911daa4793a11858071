COPS in the Northern Cape arrested an ANC ward councillor
for allegedly raping a 14-year-old mentally-ill child. The Sol Plaatjie Municipal official allegedly abducted the
14-year-old victim and her friend in Lerato Park and kept them against their
will until the 10th February 2019. ANCWL Secretary General Meokgo Matuba said the case
highlights the prevalence of atrocious crimes and violations against those
living with disabilities in society. Matuba said The ANCWL strongly condemns all crimes and
violations of women and children - more so, when those living with disabilities
are affected. Lerato Park, were the incident allegedly took place, has
been identified as one of the areas with alarming rates on cases of abuse and
violation of rights of girls living with disabilities. “As a country we need to put an end to this cycle and
protect the disabled in our communities by sending a strong message to
perpetrators,” Matuba added. The ANCWL called on the councillor to step down from his role
as a ward councilor, until the conclusion of the investigations and the
delivery of the verdict by the courts. “His membership in the ANC must be suspended until all the
due processes are concluded. The ANC has non sexism as a key pillar of its
existence and should never harbour those accused and charged with abuse against
women and children. Matuba said as an organisation we need to commit to the fight against
the scourge of violence against women and children. We must fully get rid of abusers in our midst by disowning
them and through naming and shaming of perpetrators.,” Matuba said. The ANCWL says they have also noted the criticism against
our campaign on naming and shaming those accused of abusing women and children. “As the ANCWL we will not be deterred by our detractors and
those who want the status quo to remain.”
