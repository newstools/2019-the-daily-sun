A MAN of God was apparently shot for the church’s holy water. It appears thugs heard that the church’s holy water was powerful and could help them commit crimes. The thugs went to Masowa Church, which worships in an open space in Ivory Park near Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on Thursday night and demanded the holy water. A shot was fired and one of the church members was struck and died at the scene. Church members told Daily Sun the thugs took valuables like cellphones and money. Captain Manyadza Ralidzivha of Rabasotho Police Station warned that worshippers should be extra careful. “We are not saying they must not hold services but they must be careful,” he said. Ralidzivha said murder and armed robbery cases were opened and that cops are looking for the suspects. Daily Sun spoke to members of the church, who said they have been attacked before. “We decided to stop worshipping at night but there are those who still do it,” said a member of the church. Residents said they heard gunshots on Thursday. “Later we saw cops and heard that one of the church members had been killed. We wish these people would change their places of worship. It is dangerous to hold church services in open spaces.”
