ON SUNDAY, Mandeni residents were horrified when they discovered a badly burnt body. According to police, the identity of the person found dead near a manhole in the town in northern KZN has not been established yet, but a murder docket was opened. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the body was so badly burnt that the police and residents couldn’t see if it was a man or a woman. “The body was found at 11am. We urge people who might have information to come forward.” Mbele said DNA tests were being done to find out if the person was a man or woman and urged people with a missing family member to come forward.
