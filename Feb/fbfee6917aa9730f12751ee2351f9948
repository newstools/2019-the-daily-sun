The Joburg Roads Agency announced that the old M2 bridge will be closed from 28 February until October. The agency raised concerns that of the 902 bridges managed by the City of Joburg, only 6% were in a good condition. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba said the M2 eastbound was closed in October and it was found the westbound infrastructure had shifted, leading to the shutdown of the bridge. “The agency realised parts of the support structure had moved and were affecting the structural stability of bridges on the M2 motorway. “The safety of the Selby Bridge cannot be guaranteed for continuous use by motorists and so the decision to close the M2 between Crown Interchange and Maritzburg Street was made.” The agency’s Goodwill Mbatha said: “Safety of motorists is of utmost importance and concern, leading to the urgent decision of the closure.”
