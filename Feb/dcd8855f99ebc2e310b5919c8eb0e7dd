WHEN Monica Chauke (31) gave birth to her son Sedi (7), there seemed to be no medical complications. But when the boy turned three, his genitals started swelling. Monica, from Waterval in Elim, Limpopo, said she took her son to a doctor in the area in 2016. She said the doctor referred them to Mankweng Hospital in Polokwane, Limpopo, for an operation. But the surgery was postponed because Sedi had flu on that particular day. Monica told Daily Sun: “He was given a new date. “Unfortunately, I couldn’t go because that was the day I gave birth to my second child. “I had no one to take Sedi to the hospital on my behalf. Since then, I have not been able to secure another date for the operation.” Monica added that her son’s sickness had left everyone in her family frustrated because he’s not getting any better. His gogo Sara Phiri (73) said she’s afraid her grandson will die if he doesn’t get an urgent operation. “We are scared that we will lose him if there’s nothing done. “Even at school they send him back home when the pain starts,” said gogo Sara.He even feel pains when he uses the bathroom.” The family said the boy avoids playing with other children because he’s afraid they will hurt him. “Kids will always be kids. When playing with him they mock him and see nothing wrong because they don’t understand the pain he’s feeling. “He becomes frustrated and always asks when are going to see a doctor to get a cure,” his mother Monica said. Neil Shikwambana, a spokesman for the Limpopo Health Department, advised the family to go back to Mankweng Hospital to get a new date for the operation.
