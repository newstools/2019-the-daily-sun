ANGRY residents of ward 4 in Dukuduku Village want answers from the IEC. This comes after they found that they had been moved to ward 3 of the Mtubatuba Municipality in northern KZN. They marched to the municipality’s offices on Friday. March convener Mzonjani Gumede said they were angry because the wards were last changed in 2016 and, according to their knowledge, another demarcation couldn’t take place within five years. “Following the first demarcation in 2016, we were not expecting another one before the end of 2021. What they are doing is fooling us as residents. We’re being moved from one place to another,” he said. Gumede said even though they decided not to disrupt voter registration at the weekend, they would make sure there won’t be voting in their area in May. Mtubatuba spokesman Mdu Mahlinza said: “It is an IEC matter as it issues demarcation maps for where residents will vote.” IEC spokesman Thabani Ngwira said the matter wasn’t an IEC issue, but they would listen to residents’ complaints and try to find solutions.
