A PROPHET facing rape and assault charges will know in March whether the case will go to trial. This as cops are still finalising the investigation. Prophet Abednego Mango (28) from Mkhuhlu, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, was released on R10 000 bail. He intends to plead not guilty to two counts of rape and sexual assault. On Wednesday, his case was postponed after the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court heard that the docket was returned from senior prosecutors and that they had instructed the cops to finish with outstanding statements. Prosecutor Rapelwana Sebotse said: “Cops have been instructed to complete an outstanding inquiry about their investigations, so the state has asked for further postponement to allow them to continue with the investigation.” Mango was arrested in October after two girls, aged 14 and 15, were reportedly raped and assaulted. They were members of his church.
