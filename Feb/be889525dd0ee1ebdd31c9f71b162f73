FONG KONG colleges stop students being able to progress to a better future. The department of higher education has shut down three colleges. ABM College SA, Shepherd Academy and Witbank College in Polokwane were all closed for operating without accreditation. Umalusi spokesman Sphiwe Mtshali said they would wait for the colleges to submit proof of registration and accreditation. Mokgehle Mokgehle, the colleges’ principal, said the institutions advertised non-accredited courses to check whether they were in demand. He said the colleges would get the courses accredited if there was a high demand. Higher education official Shaheed Essacks advised prospective students not to enrol at ABM College SA. “We are investigating Shepherd Academy as well. “Our investigation will be concluded within a week. “We want students to know about the colleges that are operating legally,” she said.
