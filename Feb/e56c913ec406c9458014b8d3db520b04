PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has officially opened the Gamsberg Zinc Mine in the Northern Cape. This comes after Vedanta Limited pledged to invest over 1.2 billion dollars in South Africa last year, at the inaugural investment conference. The Gamsberg Mine will be dealing in zinc, the site which is known to be the largest undeveloped ore bodies in the world. According to the Presidency, the mine will create jobs opportunities for well over 850 people â€“ who will be permanently employed. Vedanta limited has planned to spend a further 400 million dollars in investment for the second phase as part of their 800 million dollars investment plan. The company has reportedly also invested over R44 million on skills development, education, health, enterprise development and municipal infrastructure projects in the area. They also support and prioritise local procurement which will result in creating a positive spin-off for SMMEs in the area.
