LESEGO Jantjie (32) and Boitumelo Thakalekoala (29) from Germiston, Ekurhuleni, collect rubbish to make earrings. Tthey use things people throw away: pegs, can lids, matchboxes, Mageu containers, snuff and sorgum beer containers. “Everyone can relate to our earrings. They are home-made statements,” said Lesego. She said she loves African accessories, and the business does not need one to have capital. “It needs drive, skill and a passion for African jewellery.” Lesego said their jewellery was a new fashion trend and has been received with mixed reaction. “Some find our earrings different, funny or weird. Once they try them on, they realise they’re interesting. They then place orders and recommend them to others.” Lesego said they left their full-time jobs three years ago to start the jewellery and accessories business, Lessy501 Merchandise. “I concentrate on earrings and Boitumelo takes care of the bags, neck pieces and armbands.” They plan to expand by making recycled furniture. They aim to have a workshop to teach youth how to make money by using their hands. “People buy and sell our stock. We’re available at markets like the arts market at Sharpeville Human Rights Precinct.”
