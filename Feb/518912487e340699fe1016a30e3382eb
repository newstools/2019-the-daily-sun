THE house of Muila Forum chairman Richard Maphita, who is fighting alleged illegal mining at Doornhoek Mine in Ha-Muila, was burned down on Saturday. When the villagers heard about it, they torched the house and six vehicles of chief George Muila. The people from outside Makhado, Limpopo then torched two headmen’s houses. Mine property was also damaged. The chief and headmen were accused of being behind the burning and the chief of benefiting from the mine. On 18 January, residents protested, demanding mine management present their mining documents to them. After they received feedback, they were dissatisfied and stopped trucks entering the mine. Maphita said he recently opened an assault case after the chief drove over his foot. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they arrested 12 suspects. “Police have since stabilised the situation in the village.” He said more arrests are expected. Limpopo Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba slammed the attack.
