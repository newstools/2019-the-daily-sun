IT’S normal for taxi drivers to be stopped by traffic cops. But a driver becoming a passenger in his own taxi is out of the ordinary. According to digital marketer Thatego Nonyane (26), this is exactly what happened on a taxi travelling between Midrand and Joburg on Tuesday. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: “When there is traffic, drivers tend go into the yellow lane. I was in a taxi where the driver did this without noticing a cop following him. The cops stopped him and told him not to drive in that lane but he did it again. “The cop then got fed up, pulled him over again and asked for his licence. It was found he did not have one.” Thatego said the cop then said he couldn’t let the driver go as he was reckless and had no licence. “We were pissed as hell because we wanted to get home. The driver started phoning another driver and passengers start getting out to get some air.” Just when passengers were about to lose it, one of them offered to drive the taxi. He showed the cop his public driving permit before telling him he was late for work. “The taxi driver was then made to sit in the back seat while the passenger got behind the wheel. He was embarrassed and we were all laughing at him,” she said.
