COPS are looking for a taxi driver in connection with a murder. Mzwandile Zungu’s last known address was in Diepsloot ext 7, Joburg, but his current whereabouts are a mystery. He’s wanted in connection with the murder of Chinese student Pu Shirong (18). He was shot in a taxi in August and his body dumped on the corner of Main Reef and Anderson streets in Joburg. He and seven other students were on their way to Mogale City from Limpopo. They got into Zungu’s Quantum taxi at Wanderers taxi rank after failing to get hold of their regular driver. But when they reached the Joburg CBD, their driver phoned to say he was in town. They allegedly asked Zungu to take them back but he allegedly refused, even though they said they would pay him. Two people apparently then boarded the taxi. One of them pointed a gun at the students and robbed them of their belongings. One of them fought back and shots were fired. Joburg Central police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele urged anyone with information to contact Constable Matshepo Twala on 083 881 1905 or 011 497 7251.
