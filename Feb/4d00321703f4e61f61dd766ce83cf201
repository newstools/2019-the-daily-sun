 MZANSI’S biggest labor federation COSATU and its affiliates
came out in numbers to protest against unemployment in the country. The federation says President Cyril Ramaphosa’s plan to
split Eskom into three is flawed and they are against it. Cosatu threatened not to vote for the ruling party if Eskom
will be split, which could result in job losses. Nehawu President Mzwandile Makwayiba told hundreds of
protestors outside the Minerals Council that “The working class is on its own.
You must fight in order to protect your interests." Meanwhile Eskom CEO Phakamani Hadebe accepted Cosatu’s memorandum
at the Minerals Council. He said they will read the grievances on the memorandum and
respond back.
