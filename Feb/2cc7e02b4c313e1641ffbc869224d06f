Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis has named the 23 player squad set to do battle at this year’s edition of the Cyprus Women’s Cup. Ellis has dropped three players from the squad that played against the Netherlands and Sweden in last month’s friendly games. Goalkeeper Jessica Williams, forward Kelso Peskin and midfielder Hildah Magaia have been omitted in the squad for the tournament. The Cyprus Cup will be Ellis’ final opportunity to prepare her charges before picking the squad that will represent the country at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. Banyana will be making their debut at the tournament which will be played from 7 June – 7 July 2019. “The battle for places in the final squad for the World Cup is becoming tighter and tighter as we get closer to the tournament. And I have said before that starting with the Cyprus Cup, we will be travelling with only 23 players, which is the number that we will take to France as per regulations,” Ellis told the Safa website. “But make no mistake, this is by no means the World Cup squad, even though it is very close to what we will select – the tournament kicks off in June and anything can happen. “So this is a wake-up call to whoever is not in the squad because the door is never closed anyone until the announcement of the final squad, but also bear in mind that you don’t want to make too many changes so close to the competition unless there is still some exceptional talent out there that we haven’t selected,” she added.
