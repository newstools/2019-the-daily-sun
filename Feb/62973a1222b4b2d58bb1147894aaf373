MPUMALANGA bus service company Buscor has launched an investigation into a crash involving a bus and a sedan on Saturday. The bus was travelling towards White River when the incident happened. It is believed that the sedan driver may have lost control due to the wet road before colliding with the bus. Two people from the sedan were declared dead, while 69 commuters from the bus were injured, with two seriously hurt. According to Buscor’s chairwoman Norah Fakude-Nkuna, a team of experts from the company had launched an investigation. She said they are shocked by what happened. “Road safety remains a priority for us and we urge all motorists to be extra cautious when it is raining to avoid such accidents,” said Fakude-Nkuna. Community Safety spokesman Moeti Mmusi appealed to motorists to be extremely careful when driving on winding roads. The police are investigating a case of culpable homicide.
