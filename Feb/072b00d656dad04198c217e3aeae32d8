AN UMLAZI cop has lashed out at eThekwini Municipality over burst stormwater drains which turn the stream into a kak river. Mbuyiseni Gabela (49), who works at Bhekithemba cop shop in Umlazi, told Daily Sun over the weekend his family and neighbours have been living next to the kak river for more than 10 years. He said the municipality failed to fix the burst stormwater drains in BB section. Their houses are next to the stream that joins Mbokodweni River, and the burst drains have turned the stream into a smelly river. He said the unbearable smell is causing serious breathing problems for his family and neighbours. “I don’t know how many times we’ve reported this problem, but the municipality failed to fix it. “The stream is surrounded by stormwater drains that burst all the time and dirty water leaks into it. “I suspect the pipes are old and the whole drainage system needs to be changed.” Mbuyiseni said his kitchen door faces the stream, and he’s decided to close it because of the stink. He said his two young kids have also been getting sick because of the problem. Neighbour gogo Goodness Ngubane (78), said she bought her house in 1998 and the problem started a few years later. When she eats, she has to close all the doors and windows. Gogo said workers from the city’s engineering department come to fix the drains, but after a few days they burst again. Municipal housing and infrastructure head Mondli Mthembu said he wanted to see for himself why officials had failed to fix the problem.
