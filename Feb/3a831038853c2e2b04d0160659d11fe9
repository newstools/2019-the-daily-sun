WHEN the man was found with a lot of meat in his bakkie, he couldn’t tell the cops where he got it. The 59-year-old from Welbekend, Tshwane, was bust for stock theft on Thursday. Police spoksesman Sergeant Tsietsi Lamola said cops bust the man after he was found driving a Nissan bakkie filled with freshly slaughtered cows. “The suspicious bakkie was spotted on the R50 between Bapsfontein and Bronkhorstspruit. “When the cops stopped the vehicle, four men got out and ran into the nearby bush and disappeared. “Cops arrested the driver after he couldn’t say where he got the cows.” Lamola said the man briefly appeared in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrates Court on Friday and was kept in jail. The case was postponed to tomorrow for a formal bail application. Lamola said police were looking for the other suspects, who fled the scene.
