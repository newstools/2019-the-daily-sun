They say their community leaders were arrested for standing up for them after their shacks were removed by authorities. So the angry residents took to the streets on Monday, burning tyres and damaging cars. The trouble started last week when residents started dividing up pieces of vacant land in Baviaanspoort, Tshwane. They said the land had been empty for a long time while they suffered. Some even paid R500 to contribute to the building of roads. Resident Mandy Motsilenyane (40) said the land was previously used by thugs to hide and had become an illegal dump. “The police and Metro cops are unable to deal with crime here and we are here to help them. We will protest until we get our shacks back and our leaders are released.” Police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said he was not aware of any arrests linked to the protests. Tshwane Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said they were aware of the issue and were keeping an eye on the area. He said no arrests were made.
