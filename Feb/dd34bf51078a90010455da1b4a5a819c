WHEN she was young, Eulander Motopi’s dream was to be Miss South Africa. But as she grew older, bullies told her she was ugly and fat. All that changed last year when the 31-year-old from Bloemside 2 in Mangaung entered Miss South Africa Plus Size. Eulander, who won the pageant and is now a Miss Plus Size World finalist, said: “I told myself that everything people said about me wasn’t true. “I’m a beautiful, bright and enthusiastic woman. “I started doing charity work when I was a co-ordinator and motivational speaker at an NGO called Lebone. “As I got older I enhanced my beauty and continued inspiring young girls and boys to have self-respect. “Believing in yourself and how you feel is what matters most. Eulander said she entered the pageant because she believed she could inspire South Africans. “We need to teach our daughters to be fearless and our sons to respect women,” she said. Eulander asked the public to help her raise R2 000 before the end of the month so she could take part in the international leg of the pageant.
