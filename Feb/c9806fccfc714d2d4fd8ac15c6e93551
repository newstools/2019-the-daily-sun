THE Human Rights Commission has targeted Angelo Agrizzi. They announced on Wednesday that they intend to take him to the Equality Court for his use of the k-word. Testifying at the State Capture Inquiry on Tuesday, Agrizzi said: “I’m racist. I agree. Judge me on that.” Agrizzi made these statements after a video of him was played. Among other things he is heard saying: “That k-word needs a good hiding.” Agrizzi later admitted that the insults were directed at Bosasa executives Joe Gumede and Papa Leshabane. Agrizzi said he made the statements in his own home. “Those two had made threats to me and towards my family. Yes, I was wrong in expressing these sentiments, however, when people wrong you, then you might lose your cool,” he said. The HRC’s Gail Smith said they found Agrizzi’s comments particularly hurtful. She said if no action was taken against him, others with racist opinions would feel they could make similar comments. “The commission believes Mr Agrizzi engaged in hate speech.” Smith said they would ask for Agrizzi to be made to pay damages and submit the matter to the director of public prosecutions for criminal proceedings to be considered.
