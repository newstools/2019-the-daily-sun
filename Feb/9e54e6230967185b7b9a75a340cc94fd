  Mpumalanga cops have arrested
35-year-old suspect for stealing railway tracks. The man was arrested by the Hawks’ and Transnet. Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi said the team
pounced the suspects who were busy loading freshly cut railway tracks into two
vehicles that were parked nearby. She said the rest of the suspects managed to flee the scene,
leaving behind the loaded vehicles whilst the arrested man was detained on the
scene. "It is believed that just hours earlier the group had
just stripped R500 000 worth of railway tracks from the area using a blowtorch.” “Both the vehicles that
were used in the commission of crime have been seized for further investigation,"
Sekgotodi said. She said the search for the other suspects is still ongoing. The Provincial Head of The Hawks in Mpumalanga Major General
Zodwa Mokoena lauded the arrest. “Scrap dealers who continue to pay thieves cash for stolen
goods will not be spared,” she concluded.
