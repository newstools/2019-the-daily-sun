WHEN Boiketlong squatters in the Vaal saw smoke in the nearby bush yesterday morning, they called the cops. De Deur police raided the area and six suspects were spotted, but four managed to run away. Two were bust on the spot. There were signs of ground fires everywhere, probably where the insulating plastic is burned off the copper wire before it is sold to local scrapyards. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Tintswalo Ndhambi said they received a tip-off at about 8am that there was suspicious activity in Boiketlong. “When the cops and Hawks members arrived at the scene, they arrested two suspects on charges of possession of stolen cables. The suspects will appear in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court soon,” she said.
