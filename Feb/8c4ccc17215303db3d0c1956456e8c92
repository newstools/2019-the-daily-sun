FIVE kids were seriously injured and rushed to hospital when their scholar transport taxi drove into a tree yesterday. Another 11 sustained minor injuries. Witnesses told Daily Sun the taxi was transporting kids from Braamfischer in Soweto to a school in Fleurhof. “We don’t know what happened. The taxi just lost control and crashed,” said Nonkululeko Zondi (38), who was driving on the same road. “I just thought of my kid, who also uses scholar transport.” No one could say what caused the accident. “We’re not sure what caused the taxi to lose control,” said Mbuso Thabethe (36), another motorist. “But we’re glad no life was lost.” Metro cop Superintendent Wayne Minnaar confirmed the accident.
