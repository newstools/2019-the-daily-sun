IT was third time lucky for Bloemfontein Celtic reserves who finally secured their maiden MultiChoice Diski Challenge title on Saturday. They beat Kaizer Chiefs 3-1 in the final game of an action packed festival at Makhulong Stadium. A brace from defender Mokone Mereko as well as a goal from striker Lefa Wesi were enough to see Celtic clinch the title on the final day. The Young Siwelele had come agonisingly close the past two seasons, finishing second on both occasions, but they were not to be denied this time around. They could have wrapped up the title in the penultimate game of the season, however they received a setback when they lost to Baroka. Many thought they had seen this movie before with Celtic faltering near the finish line, but Abram "Wire" Nteo's boys would not make the same mistake. They headed into the final day knowing they had to beat a free-scoring Amakhosi outfit to win the title regardless of other results. By the time they took to the field for the last game of the day, Celtic only needed a draw to pip second placed Rise and Shine to the title. The Citizens, who drew with Rise and Shine, were out of the running along with Matsatsantsa whose 2-1 victory against Free State Stars was in vain. The Young Siwele, who already had one hand on the title, got off to the perfect start through a Mereko penalty in the 12th minute. However, Amakhosi equalised six minutes later through Sizwe Twala who caught out Celtic goalkeeper Sipho Chiane with a clever free kick. That would be as good as it got for Chiefs as Celtic got a foothold in the game and capitalised with two goals. Striker Wesi finished off a flowing move for The Young Siwelele to put them back in the lead before eventual man of the match Mereko put the result beyond doubt with another penalty. Celtic will now look forward to the overseas trip that comes with winning the tournament while the other teams will hope for better luck in the upcoming Diski Shield.
