THIS family has many mouths to feed. But thanks to SunPower, they can now go to bed on full stomachs. Daily Sun told the story of struggling parents Sibongile Musi (36) and Tshani Miya (33) and their triplets last week. Then SUNPOWER has reached out to the struggling parents of the triplets featured in   Daily Sun   on Thursday(31/1) .Prophet Paseka Motsoeneng Mboro came forward to help them with food parcels and nappies for the kids. But that is not the best part of the news . . . Tshani starts working at a new job today! When Mboro learnt that Tshani was good at plumbing, he hired him on the spot. “Come work at my construction company on Monday. From next month, you’ll be able to pay your own rent,” he said. On Saturday, the family from Palm Ridge in Ekurhuleni told Mboro they had received their grant money but had to pay rent, which left them with very little to cover the necessities for the kids. Mboro took the family to the shops and bought groceries and paid their rent for the month. Sibongile told Daily Sun they had been moving from one place to the other as they couldn’t afford rent. Sibongile said they will register the triplets at a creche next month, so that she too can start looking for work. He said the parents should consider getting closer to God. “The kids are God’s way to call you closer to him.” Sibongile thanked the prophet and Daily Sun. “At least today we will sleep on full stomachs,” she said. Tshani said: “I will work hard to show the prophet that I’m grateful for the opportunity.”
