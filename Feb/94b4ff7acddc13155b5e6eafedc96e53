BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic reserves are hoping for a third time lucky in the Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC). For the past two seasons (2016-17 and 2017-18), Celtic finished the season as runners-up. Yet again this season, the Young Siwelele have found themselves in a similar position where they just need to secure four points in their remaining two games to be crowned champions. They are on top of the MDC table with 29 points from 13 matches. A victory for Celtic and defeat for second-placed Cape Town City this weekend will declare them 2018-19 Diski champions. But their closest rivals City will form part of the penultimate Diski Challenge Festival in Ulundi where they face Kaizer Chiefs at Prince Mangosuthu Regional Stadium on Saturday at 12pm. Celtic will visit Baroka FC at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday at 10am. Their last match of the season will be against Kaizer Chiefs at Dobsonville Stadium. Celtic captain Shadrack Kobedi says they wonâ€™t allow Baroka to stand on their way.
