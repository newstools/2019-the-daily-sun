NTOMBENHLE Ntshangase from Ematheni Village in Nquthu, northern KZN, is a busy gogo. The 60-year-old makes and sells wooden chopping boards, brooms made of grass, beaded necklaces, sleeping mats and clay pots. She told Daily Sun she started the business several years ago after she left her kids’ dad. “Back then I needed money to raise my kids, but now I’m doing it out of love,” said Ntombenhle. She said for wooden chopping boards, brooms, sleeping mats and clay pots, she got most of her material from the bush. She buys materials for her beadwork. Gogo said she often getsorders around September. “I get many orders in September as it is heritage month,” said Ntombenhle. “This is the time when many people dress in their traditional clothes. “I also get more orders in December because people have traditional events such as umemulo and traditional weddings. “They also need traditional mats on the list of gifts.” She said her wish was to get a bigger place to sell her products. “I don’t have a proper place to sell and show my products,” she said. “I take them to where there are gatherings in the area and put them on the ground for people to see.”
