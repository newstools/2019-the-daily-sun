AFTER more than 20 days of anxious waiting, Lebogang Selekane (36) is relieved his uncle’s body was recovered from Gloria Coal Mine in Mpumalanga. The body of Simon Sebajoa (38), who is originally from Lesotho, was located on Friday. Simon was among more than 22 people who were allegedly stealing copper cables when they got trapped in the mine earlier this month. The rescue team managed to recover 12 bodies in the past weeks and 13 were discovered in the early hours of Friday morning, bringing the death toll to 25. Lebogang told Daily Sun this has brought an end to their wait. “It didn’t make sense when they told us about difficulties in recovering the bodies. We are relieved his body was finally recovered,” said Lebogang. Even though they prepared themselves for the worst, Simon’s death still came as a shock when they had to identify his body on Saturday. “It was a difficult moment for everyone. I had to undress him so that I could identify him because their bodies were not in a good state,” he said. Efforts to bring up all the remaining bodies were expected to continue yesterday as the rescue operation had to be halted due to excessive smoke in the mine shafts on Friday. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said so far, 16 bodies had been identified by their next of kin. One body has not been unidentified.
