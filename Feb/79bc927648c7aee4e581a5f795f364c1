NOMASONTO Mazibuko needs help for her daughter, who’s battling to sleep. The 34-year-old mum from Lindelani, Ekurhuleni, said the problem started three years ago when her kid was one. She told Daily Sun the problem was getting worse and she desperately needed help. “Before that my child slept all night but woke up very early in the morning,” said Nomasonto. “She didn’t cry and just started playing. She also didn’t look tired during the day.” “But now she’s battling to sleep and this is worrying me.” Nomasonto said when she consulted sangomas, she was told her daughter was haunted by evil spirits but they couldn’t help her. “I have spent more than R8 000 on sangomas, but with no luck.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi told the People’s Paper the only way to find out about the child’s problem was through consultation. “This kind of matter is complicated. We can look into it and try to help the child,” said Joseph.
