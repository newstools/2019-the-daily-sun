SUPPORTERS of the Please Call Me Movement told Vodacom to pay up or be shut down. The movement, which is in support of Nkosana Makate, has demanded Vodacom pay him R70 billion for his Please Call Me idea. Yesterday, hundreds of activists protested outside Vodaworld in Midrand, Joburg. They said they would make sure the cellphone giant remained closed. Makate apparently came up with the idea more than 20 years ago when he was employed by the company. The Constitutional Court ordered the company to compensate Makate but it claimed MTN came up with the idea first. Many social media users have taken to Twitter to announce they had left Vodacom. Even Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi and former public prosecutor Thuli Madonsela supported Makate.
