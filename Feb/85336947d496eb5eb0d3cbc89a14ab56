  Two City Power officials were arrested for demanding a R6500
bribe from a resident in Wilropark, West of Johannesburg. It is alleged that the pair is doing this for the second
time and is due in court for their first offence. According to the City’s Lucky Sindane the officials
approached the Wilropark resident yesterday morning and introduced themselves
as officials from the City. They allegedly told the resident that his electricity meter
belonged to a house in Ruimsig, and that it was supposed to be a three phase
meter. “The suspects then threatened to disconnect the resident’s
electricity supply unless he pays them R6500. 
The resident agreed to pay the money to the officials but requested them
to come later in the day to collect the cash,” he said. Sindane added that the resident then informed the City’s
Group Forensic and Investigation Services (GFIS) team, which set up a sting
operation together with the members of the South African Police Service (SAPS). “The officials arrived at house in Wilropark yesterday
afternoon to collect the cash. SAPS then apprehended the suspects in the
wrongful act, they will appear in court tomorrow for this crime,” added
Sindane.
