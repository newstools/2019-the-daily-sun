A social movement is calling on all South African men to boycott this year’s Valentine ’s Day all together! Instead, the movement is calling on all men to meet at a “secret location” where they will discuss issues that are important to them. The #MensConference movement has been gaining momentum for weeks and now that we’re just hours away from the day of love, the call is at an all-time high. South African men are so serious about this social movement of theirs that it has been trending all day long on Twitter. There’s even a programme that’s doing the rounds. On the list of speakers are Melusi Gigaba and Emtee who will speak under the theme “Size Doesn’t Matter, Mampintsha will tackle the “No Abuse” presentation, “Lose Weight” will be handled by Julius Malema, and Nico Matlala will do the “Pay Papgeld” honours. Also expected to “appear” are Kwesta, DJ Fresh and Mo Flava and, we quote, “Bhuti Zodwa Wabantu”. So, where will you be tomorrow?
