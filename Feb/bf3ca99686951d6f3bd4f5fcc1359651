RESIDENTS have vowed to stop the opening of a new hospital unless KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo addresses them. Residents of Inanda, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu, north of Durban, teamed up with political party, African Freedom Revolution, to organise a march to the new Dr Pixley Ka Isaka Seme Memorial Hospital in KwaMashu. Sabelo Ntuli (32), a qualified security guard from Bhambayi squatter camp in Inanda, said they were disappointed the hospital hired workers without telling locals first. The party’s president Bishop Bheki Ngcobo said residents told him about the issue last week when he was briefing party branches about their manifesto launch. He urged them to meet his party’s leadership at the hospital on Sunday morning. He said people who were left out during the recruitment process must bring their CVs and proof of residence. “We will hand their CVs over to MEC Dhlomo. We will give him seven days to respond, but if he doesn’t we’ll meet him on the street.”
