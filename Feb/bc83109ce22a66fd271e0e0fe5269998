TWO groups of villagers from Agincourt and Xanthia, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, have given the Bushbuckridge Municipality seven working days to respond to their demands. The residents took to the streets on Wednesday to show their anger. They handed over a memorandum of demands to the municipal authorities, complaining about water and roads. Speaking to the SunTeam, one of the residents, Patrick Khoza, said they believed the municipality had forgotten about them since it kept failing to fulfil its promises. He said there were no services in their villages Patrick said the mayor visited them last year and promised to speed up service delivery, which included paving a road. But none of this happened and until today they are still waiting. “Our ward councillor has failed to give us answers and we need the mayor to address the issues we are raising,” he said. “We will continue to fight peacefully for services without burning property, but we want the mayor to know that enough is enough. We can’t wait any longer. It’s time the municipality stopped taking us for granted, otherwise we will not vote.” Acting Bushbuckridge mayor Lindiwe Sithole received the memorandum. She said the demands raised by residents would be addressed.
