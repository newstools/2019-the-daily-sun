The multimillion-rand PowerBall winner from Cape Town, who won R232 131 750.69 last Tuesday, has finally been found.  "The winner has come forward," Ithuba corporate relations executive Khensani Mabuza told News24 on Tuesday morning.  "They played a manual selection and they played for R22.50 and the ticket was bought at OK Minimark in Tygerdal, Cape Town," said Mabuza.  Only one ticket won the jackpot, which was nearly R10m more than the estimated amount.  Mabuza could not provide more details as she was about to go on air. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/r232m-powerball-winner-finally-comes-forward-20190226
