EVIL is around us but it can be defeated by the Bible! Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoneng proved this at Incredible Happenings Church on Friday night when he held an all night prayer session. Congregants brought soil from their yards, salt, candles and water in containers. Mboro prayed for the items and gave members of the congregation instructions to follow when they got home. He said the items he prayed for would help catch those who attacked people’s homes. There were some scary confessions during the church service. A woman said she was at the church physically, but her spirit was roaming in graves. “That’s where I’ve been sent to work,” she said. She said she used the remains of dead people to bring bad luck to families. A mother of a 12-year-old told the prophet of how unruly her son was at home. When Mboro prayed, the boy started crying. That’s when he confessed to things he was made to do. He said he was recruited to do evil things with his late gogo, but now that she had died he had to keep going. He said he was made to do all sorts of evil things, including sleeping with his mum. A man said he had been told to kill people, eat their flesh and drink their blood. Mboro said the people he prayed for were not the evil ones. “There are masterminds out there who are taking advantage of the weak. “They capture them and make them do whatever they want,” he said.
