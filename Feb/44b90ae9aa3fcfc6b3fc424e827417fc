Two pupils were seriously injured at Lentegeur High School in Cape Town on Monday morning.  "They have received medical attention and are both stable. One will be released on Monday and the other, with a head and neck injury, on Tuesday," department spokesperson, Bronagh Hammond said. According to Hammond, the attack happened just before the school day started. The victims are in Grades 10 and 11 while the alleged perpetrators are in Grades 9 and 11. "Emergency security was arranged and counselling has been offered to both educators and learners," added Hammond.     ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that the boy was hospitalised after he was stabbed at a school in Manor, outside the CBD. "On arrival, paramedics found a 14-year-old boy being treated by an on-site nurse. The boy was assessed and found to have sustained stab wounds to his arm, shoulder and back," said Meiring. Paramedics treated the boy and transported him to Northdale Hospital for further care. It is understood that a fellow pupil used a pair of scissors to stab him. The incident was reported to the police for further investigation.
