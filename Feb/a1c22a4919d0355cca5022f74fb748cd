The management of police in Gauteng has welcomed the
long-term sentence handed down in the South Gauteng High Court to a triple
murder convict. The sentence was handed to a man found guilty of three
counts of murder and other serious offences related to gangs in Sophiatown,
Joburg. Francisco Miller (28) was arrested during an
intelligence-led operation in Elsies River, Cape Town in April 2017 following
an incident where three suspects from Cape Town arrived at Dorothea Flats in
Newclare, Joburg, armed with R5 rifles and handguns. A man was shot and killed through the window of a flat while
two other victims were killed during a shootout between two rival gangs. Miller will effectively serve 40 years behind bars after
pleading guilty for three counts of murder for which he was handed a 30-year
sentence per murder; attempted murder with eight (8) years; robbery aggravated
with 15 years; possession of unlicensed firearms another 15 years; and
possession of ammunition with four (4) years. Gauteng SAPS spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told Daily Sun that police have, since last
year, intensified crime combating efforts in Sophiatown and the broader
Westbury policing precinct following the violent protests that erupted in
September 2018 where community members accused police of not doing enough in
relation to fighting gangsterism and drugs. “More work is on the cards in unison with one of the
Provincial Commissioner's priorities that speaks to addressing organised crime
and drugs,” she said. Gauteng Commissioner of Police Lieutenant General Elias
Mawela commended the efforts of the investigating officers whose commitment and
diligence has brought about this successful conviction and sentence which will
certainly go a long way in restoring public confidence in the Service.
