A TEENAGER who married a 62-year-old madala is begging
the world to stop judging the couple for the age difference between them. According to the Sun, Samantha Simpson (19) from Arkansas,
America first met hubby JR through friends a year ago. She said: "When I saw JR I was automatically drawn
to how well presented he was and the fact that he was such a gentleman. "He was very well spoken whenever we met, and also
when we would talk over the phone and text, he was just something I had never
found in a man before. "I have dated men who have been closer to my age
before, but they've been very immature and haven't known how to treat their
partner. "Being with JR is completely different - he's so
mature and treats me like a Queen, there's nothing that I would change about
him or our relationship." But their blissful relationship is soured by all the mean
comments made to them when they’re out in public, with people calling JR a “child
snatcher”, a “paedophile” and mistaking him for her madala. Samantha said: "When we are out in public, we have
strangers mistaking us for grandad and granddaughter all of the time and it can
really upset me. "But it's even worse when people call JR a 'child
snatcher' or a 'paedophile' when they see us hold hands or kiss in public. "There's not a moment when we are out and about that
someone doesn't make a comment about our relationship, and it's just
exhausting. "We have had enough of a hard time with family and
friends not accepting our relationship, that when strangers do it too it just
becomes too much. "We just want people to realise that we are happily
married and serious about our relationship - and other people shouldn't be
discriminating us in such a way." Samantha and JR are especially desperate for the public
abuse to stop because they are actively trying to fall pregnant.
