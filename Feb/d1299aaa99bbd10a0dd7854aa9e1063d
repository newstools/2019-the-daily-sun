ETV soapie star, Nomvelo Makhanya, also known as Lindiwe Ngema from Scandal, is sad over what twitter had to  say about her head. This is after an episode trended on twitter on Valentine’s Day because of Nomvelo’s head. Some even took it as far as turning her head into memes. Yesterday, on the 17nth of February she went live on instagram, venting and letting people how hurt she is that her head has overshadowed her work. In that video, she also emphasized how hard she worked on that day’s story-line and how she is now afraid of watching herself. “Can we please be kind to each other? Everyone knows how much I worked on that story but it seems like my head is overshadowing my work. You guys are not looking at what the story is about,” said Nomvelo.   Winile Dubazane expressed how sad she was because of this and also shared a story of her own. “I actually feel what Mvelo Makhanya is going through. Growing up I was always teased about how my head is shaped like a boy, big eyes and big bum. It sticks, it took me a while to appreciate myself.  So can we please be kind, words break people,” Winile tweeted.  Gigi Lamayne also gave her words of encouragement.  “You’re freaking amazing. This bullying only happens to those who actually have something to lose. Keep on. You’re BEAUTIFUL,” she tweeted.  Mpho Moiloa also sympathised with Nomvelo.  “This broke my heart. Social media can be so toxic! That little joke you make just for RTs can really impact someone. Let’s do better, really guys this is not on,” Mpho tweeted.
