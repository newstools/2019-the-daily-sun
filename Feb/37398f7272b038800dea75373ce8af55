CORRECTIONAL Services has warned people about a job scam on social media inviting people to apply for employment and learnership opportunities. The department said applying for work at correctional services and in the public sector was free and anyone asking for money was breaking the law. Department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said they used the public services department administration website and internal email to advertise jobs. He said the department urged people to report those pretending to be consultants or who use online media platforms to advertise jobs. He called on people who have information on the fraudsters to report it on the government’s anti-corruption hotline. The wholesale and retail sectors were seen as problem areas. The department’s Aggy Moiloa said they had 1 392 inspectors ready to check compliance. Any non-compliance would be referred to the CCMA. The R20 minimum wage an hour applies from 1 January.
