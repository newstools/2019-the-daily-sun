THREE suspected stock thieves were bust by cops on Monday. The men, aged between 26 and 41, were caught while transporting seven cows from Tzaneen to Polokwane in Limpopo. Police spokeswoman Constable Minkie Ramakgoakgoa said the suspects were bust after cops got a tip-off from residents. “Cops had responded to information about a Ford Ranger bakkie pulling a trailer with cows,” she said. “They spotted the vehicle near the Mall of the North in Polokwane and pulled it over.” “Seven suspected stolen cows were discovered in the trailer. “The three suspects failed to produce the necessary documents and couldn’t say where they got the cattle. “They were arrested on the spot and will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon, facing charges of possession of suspected stolen stock.” Acting deputy provincial commissioner, Major Jan Scheepers, praised dedicated police who performed their duties well. Scheepers said cops appreciated the residents’ help in their fight against stock theft.
