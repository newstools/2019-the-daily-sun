WHEN two elephants fight, it’s the grass that gets trampled. This saying proved true at Leratong Hospital in Mogale City yesterday. One group of nurses held another group hostage! Patients were left waiting at the entrance with no one to help them, while workers protested over what they said was unfair treatment at the hands of managers. The workers closed the gates and made sure no one entered or left the hospital premises. Gogo Anna Shabangu (63) from Braamfischer in Soweto told the SunTeam she had been sitting in a queue since 4am to have her diabetes checked. Nurses said all they wanted was fair treatment from management. National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union spokesman Eazy Mokawane said: “Since 2016, we have been engaging with management and asking them to fill vacant posts but they keep making empty promises.” Mokawane said the staff shortages meant that one person had to do the work of seven people. Hospital spokeswoman Fikile Oyekanmi said they spoke to the nurses’ leaders and all of them had agreed to resolve the matter peacefully.
