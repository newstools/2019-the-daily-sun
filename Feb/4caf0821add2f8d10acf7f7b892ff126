ANDISIWE is over the moon with her tokoloshe Valentine. Andisiwe Mlotshwa (29) from Leondale, Ekurhuleni said the tokoloshe scared her when he first arrived when she was only 20 years old. But that’s all in the past. “For the last nine years, my Valentine’s Day has been fantastic!” she said. “After the first time, I woke up wet the next morning. I realised I had just had the best sex ever,” she said. And then she had a perfect day. “I glowed,” said Andisiwe. She said when it happened the next year, she made sure she was wide awake. She said the tokoloshe was a short man, but she couldn’t see his face properly. “I didn’t question anything. I let it do whatever it wanted. I wasn’t scared at all. I had the best sex ever with multiple orgasms.” Andisiwe said this happens every year. She even chases her boyfriend away on Valentine’s Day just to feel the pleasure. She said she is not sure if she needs help or not as she enjoys her annual date with her tokoloshe. “I know this is weird, but I can’t help myself. I love it! I always look forward to Valentine’s Day!” She said she doesn’t want to lose the feeling. “But it is affecting my relationship with my boyfriend.” Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi who said he had never had to deal with a woman who enjoyed sex with a tokoloshe. “Patients usually complain they are in pain and want it to go away. This is a special case and she needs help,” he said.
