EVERY night, thieves break into village shops and steal stock worth thousands. They gain entry after cutting through the corrugated iron roofs. Up to 10 shops are affected almost every day, mostly in Makuleke, Maphophe, Xikundu and Mhinga villages . The latest victim, Hasani Khosa (50), said: “I’m tired of these greedy criminals. My shop has been broken into by the same thugs twice, back to back. I’ve lost over R100 000 in stock since January. “I reported all cases to the local police but no one has been bust. “My fear is having to close down. I appeal to cops to bust thugs before it’s too late.” Hasani said the problem started four months ago. “I thought it would never happen to me but in January and this month, thugs stole money, groceries, cigarettes and airtime. “I urge people not to buy stolen groceries and stop thugs from stealing from us.” James Maluleke (36) said: “Thugs are killing our business. I have lost count of how many times my shop has been robbed.” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “We’re investigating cases reported to us by the victims. We advise the owners to tighten securityand hire security guards.”
