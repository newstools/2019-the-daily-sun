WHEN their love died, she allegedly wanted to kill her newborn baby too. But fortunately, the child was saved by a man who found him dumped in the bush on Tuesday. Now the 28-year-old mum from phase 6 kasi in Mangaung, Free State, has been arrested. She allegedly confessed to cops that she felt she couldn’t keep the child after his father dumped her. Tshidiso Raseobi (31), the hero who saved the baby boy, said he made the discovery after going to the bushes to relieve himself. “While peeing, I heard a baby crying and when I got closer, I saw tiny hands coming out of a brown jacket. There was a rope around his neck,” he said. “We alerted the cops and the baby was taken to the local cop shop. I hear the mum was arrested. I hope she rots in jail,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said: “A child negligence case has been opened. The suspect will appear before the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.”
