ON WEDNESDAY the family of gogo Bella Seemane finally got good news. The gogo from Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, who went missing on Sunday afternoon was found safe and sound. On Wednesday, Daily Sun published an article about her disappearance. At the time, her grandson, Moroke Moeketsane (44) said gogo Bella went to buy sweets while visiting a niece in block B of Mabopane and never returned. He said the family was worried because the gogo has dementia. The gogo was spotted by family members walking in Mabopane while they were looking for her. “She was walking like she knew where she was going and there was nothing wrong with her,” said Moroke. He said when they asked where the gogo had been, she said she was at home. “She wasn’t aware that she was lost. We took her to the doctor and after several check-ups, we were told she was unharmed,” He said since the gogo had been found, the family is happy again. “We were stressed that she was missing. We couldn’t eat, sleep or even think clearly.” Moroke said he and his family were grateful for all the support they had received. “Many people helped us, as did the police and we really appreciate it,” he said.
