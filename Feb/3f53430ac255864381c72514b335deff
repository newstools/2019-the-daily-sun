AN UBER driver has been implicated in the robbery at Edenvale High School on Thursday. Claiming he was hijacked, he was found with cash thought to belong to the school. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said armed men forced the principal to open the school safe and took R8 000. “The school alarm went off and alerted security and police.” Videos of panicking pupils went viral on social media. Captain Kay Makhubele said one suspect allegedly came to the school, telling security guards he had come to pick up a pupil. As guards let him in, more suspects entered and allegedly held the principal at gunpoint and robbed him. “Police were alerted and responded. A shoot-out followed, where two suspects were killed. “One suspect was wounded and another two bust. Cops found a getaway vehicle near the school and bust a fourth suspect with two firearms.” Police believe there are more suspects and have urged those who can assist to call their nearest police station or 08600 10111. The suspects will appear in the Edenvale Magistrates Court soon.
