RESIDENTS of Thabong in Welkom said they are tired of the rivers of kak in their kasi. They said two months ago they told the municipality about a broken manhole in the area. Resident John Masupa told Daily Sun living near the manhole was like living in a toilet. “My home is like a prison. I have to keep all my windows and doors closed because of the unbearable smell.” Matjhabeng municipal spokesman Kgojane Matutle said: “We have a big illegal mining problem in the area, and it is contributing to the collapse of our infrastructure. “Foreign objects are also thrown into our sewage pipes. We are waiting for new pipes before we attend to the problem. “We also appeal to the community not to throw foreign objects into the pipe lines.”
