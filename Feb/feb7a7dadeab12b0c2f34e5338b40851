LAST Tuesday, the Khanyile family had to ask neighbours for shelter. A heavy storm had damaged the roof of their five-roomed house. Now the family from Kwaleja Village in Greytown, KZN Midlands, is asking for help to rebuild their house. Gogo Petronella Khanyile (66) told Daily Sun she had to spend her pension money on groceries as all her children were unemployed. “After buying groceries, I’m left with nothing, making things harder when emergencies like this happen,” she said. “When our area was hit with heavy rain and wind, I had already spent all my pension on food for the family.” Gogo said she would be grateful if a Good Samaritan could help her family. “We sleep at neighbours’ homes and they keep our belongings safe. Even though they haven’t complained about helping us, we don’t want to overstay our welcome.” Councillor Sibeke Zakwe said he visited the family with a disaster management team from Umvoti Municipality and social workers. “We gave them a food voucher and compiled a report on the damage, which was submitted to the co-operative governance department. “We are still waiting for a response.” He said the homes of 65 families in his ward were damaged in the storm.
