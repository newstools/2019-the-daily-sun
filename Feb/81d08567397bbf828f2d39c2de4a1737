The award winning Lerato Kganyago has bashed followers who want her to broadcast her private life. On the 12 th of February LKG tweeted a picture of herself in a swim suit and someone commented  on that tweet by asking about Lerato’s private life. “Do you have a boyfriend as I always see you post alone and lonely,” Nyiko Mangotlo tweeted. This did not sit well with LKG, she decided to reply with a heart hitting tweet.“Just because I don’t post, cars, homes, family or boyfriends, don’t assume I don’t have. "I don’t advertise my private life, it remains that, private, and not a community project my love, Love ME for me, not what I have,” Lerato replied. Another replied on that tweet and saying Lerato’s response was unnecessary and that the tweet required a yes or no answer. Lerato decided to reply to this one as well.“Very necessary for me to go in depth with my explanation for the people I follow or that follow me.So they understand who and what I am. I owe it to them. You don’t like it, unfollow my love, thosethat care get it,” Lerato Tweeted.Ntokozo Mntambo expressed her opinion saying she is happy with LKG, whether she is alone or not. “Some of us are happy by just seeing you, whether you’re alone or with someone, in a car, on a pool,in studio, on top of a building we don&#39;t care as long as sibone LKG, we’re sorted,” Ntokozo tweeted.
