police in East London have urged residents of Amalinda to help them prevent more school burglaries. This was in response to a spate of burglaries at Lukhanyo Primary School, which has been broken into 10 times since last January. Cambridge station commander Brigadier Pumla Mdlankomo addressed members of the community at an imbizo on Saturday. “The community needs to provide information that will help us make arrests,” said Mdlankomo. Principal Bulelwa Sithole said morale was low at the school. “Our equipment was stolen and our nutrition programme was interrupted. There is no motivation at all because this hinders progress,” he said. School governing body chairman Ayanda Ngqandu asked for more police visibility. “Residents are too scared to come forward with information that could lead to the culprits’ arrest,” he said. “One resident was killed in 2015 after she shouted at a gang that broke into Lumko Primary School. “That case was never solved. We want the local tavern to be regulated because it’s open all day. “We want to have tight security and good fencing.” Circuit manager Mluleki Mrwebi said there was a safety crisis at the school. He asked the school’s management to make sure someone was employed to help police.
