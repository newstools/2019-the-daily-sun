MAMA Rebecca Kotane was celebrated yesterday. Her 107th birthday party in Diepkloof, Soweto, was attended by friends, family, neighbours and leaders of both the ANC and SACP. Mama Kotane was born in 1912. She is the widow of the late former SACP general secretary and ANC treasurer general, Moses Kotane. People who attended the party described mama Kotane as a humble soul. “It’s better because we are celebrating her while she’s still alive,” said her son Joseph. Gauteng Premier David Makhura said when they asked mama Kotane what she wanted for a birthday present, she asked for a wheelchair and a blanket. He said gogo asked for a big cake to be donated to a children’s home. ANC secretary general Ace Magashule said mama Kotane’s birthday was very special to the party. “That’s because she was born the exact year the ANC was formed.”
