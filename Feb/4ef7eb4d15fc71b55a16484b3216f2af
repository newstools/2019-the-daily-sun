GOGO’s last wish is to have a house before she dies. Mavis Mazibuko (86) said she has been living at Sonwabo, Katlehong, since 1999. She said she’s the only person in her neighbourhood who’s without an RDP. Mavis’ grandson Thapelo Masiteng (25) said he would be hurt if his grandmother died while still living in a mkhukhu. Gogo Mavis is sick and can’t walk. Thapelo does everything for her, including bathing her. “I’m a boy, and this isn’t easy for me. There are no family members who’ll help me,” he said. Thapelo said the only source of income they have is his gogo’s pension money, which does not last the whole month. The human settlement department’s Lebohang Keswa said: “The department’s preliminary investigation indicates that Mavis Mazibuko has received a housing subsidy from government, and that led to her not qualifying for another one. “She should visit the department’s Alberton offices and will be assisted in cancelling the subsidy under her name and applying for a new subsidy.”
