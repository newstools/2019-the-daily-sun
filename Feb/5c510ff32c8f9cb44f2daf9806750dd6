MZWAKHE Mazibuko realised he had artistic talent after he was retrenched. The 41-year-old from Sebokeng in the Vaal used to work with wooden pallets for a living, but these days he creates beautiful sculptures. His first creation was a small sculpture of former president Nelson Mandela. “During the 67 minutes for Mandela campaign, I decided to take a hammer and chisel to create an artwork from wood. “The outcome was unbelievable. A number of people liked it and encouraged me to do more.” Mzwakhe said his first order was from someone who wanted a sculpture of a crocodile for the Bakwena clan. “I make most of the totems they use to identify themselves. I sell my sculptures in small, medium and large sizes, and charge between R180 and R350,” he said. He also makes tables, chairs, people, shields and spears. “My dream is to teach primary school kids,” he said. “There are many kids who’are good with art, and I want them to discover their talent at an early age because that didn’t happen to me.” It takes him three days to finish a piece over 850cm. “With the money I make from my art, I’m able to buy things I couldn’t afford when I was working full time. I bought furniture and can easily feed my family.”
