SIX pupils were arrested for possession of drugs on Wednesday at Chipa-Tabane Secondary School in Cullinan, east of Tshwane. Police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said a 20-year-old male was the first to be arrested. Five more were later bust and charged with dealing in drugs. The arrested pupils, aged between 19 and 22, were in possession of Kat and dagga. “We normally visit schools to give talks and search pupils,” she said. “We’ve now eliminated drug dealers at the local high school. “Parents and teachers are urged to take a stand against the use of illegal substances.” Moganedi said everyone should be observant and become aware when children are reacting to peer pressure, which leads young people to believe that turning to drugs and alcohol will make you popular. She said many children first encounter illegal substances in high school and the curiosity can be too much to resist. The pupils made a brief appearance in the Cullinan Magistrates Court last week.
