TWO men were shot dead and a third man injured in a shootout that happened at Edenvale High School. PANICKING parents rushed to the Edenvale High School on Thursday afternoon after shots were heard from inside the school. One parent said she was at work when she received an alert from the school. “I dropped everything then came rushing to the school. I panicked when I saw helicopters and ambulances around the school. Traffic was being diverted away from the school and it made it difficult to reach the gates.” The parent said that she cried when she saw that her two boys were all okay. Another parent said that they received a call from their kid. “I received a call from my son, he was panicking and crying on the phone it made hard to make out what he was saying. I decided to drop everything and rush here. I was scared that he’d been hurt. I am glad that he is safe,” the parent said. A resident whose house is opposite the school said that at around 12, he heard gunshots coming from what he originally thought was the Edenvale Police Station. “I thought someone was trying to get out of the prison. I heard two initial gunshots. Then there were about 10 shots that seemed to be an exchange of gunfire. Then there was one final shot which was near my house,” the resident said. Ekurhuleni Emergency Services Spokesperson William Ntladi said that they logged a call at around 12:10 PM. “We can confirm that two suspects were shot dead at the scene. One suspect survived and he was shot on the head.” Ntladi said that there were no reports of learners of staff being injured.
