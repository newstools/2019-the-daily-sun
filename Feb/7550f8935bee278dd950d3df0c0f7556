POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has expressed shock at the killing of two police officers during a shoot-out with a cash-in-transit gang on Friday. Cele visited the cops’ families in Durban and Port Shepstone, KZN yesterday. Warrant Officer Sfundo Musa (39) and Lieutenant-Colonel Carl van der Vyer (51) were allegedly killed by the gang. Seven gang members were also killed by cops after the gang tried to rob a cash-in-transit van between Hlabisa and Nongoma. Cele offered his condolences to the cops’ families and visited the scene of the crime. He said it was another sad day for the police. National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole said: “I offer my highest praise to all our colleagues that have once again put their lives on the line to bring hardened and selfish criminals to book.” Sitole said members of the Special Task Force and Crime Intelligence were following up on intelligence that a cash-in-transit vehicle was going to be attacked. He said a group of heavily armed suspects attacked the security vehicle and used explosives to reach the cash. “Members of the Special Task Force team responded speedily, which resulted in a shoot-out between them and the robbers. “Seven suspects, a member from Crime Intelligence and a Special Task Force member were killed during the incident. A female member who was shot in the leg is currently receiving medical treatment,” said Sitole. He said four AK-47 assault rifles were recovered. Sitole said the BMW car used by the suspects had been used during other robberies.
