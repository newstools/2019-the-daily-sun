SOWETO residents welcomed Patricia de Lille with open arms! The Good leader went on a door-to-door campaign in Pimville yesterday.  One of the oldest residents in the kasi, Thabo Seemela said Good should deliver services. “We were promised the world and got disappointment in return. Members of various political parties visit us during the voting period, but never come back. “We will give you an opportunity to engage us and see if you can deliver,” Thabo told De Lille.  He told her about the RDP house he never received. “I’m one of the people who registered for a house but I still live with my parents,” he said. De Lille was pleased with the reception she received from residents and promised to deliver on promises she made regarding their issues. “Our members have been working in the area telling people of Soweto about the Good movement. Some people wanted me, personally, to listen to their problems. So I came to listen to their concerns and problems,” she said. De Lille said her party is different from the other parties.  “I have assured them we will have follow-ups to their problems.We can’t come with solutions but we can contact government departments and help them,” she said. Good will launch their Gauteng manifesto in Klipfontein on Saturday.
