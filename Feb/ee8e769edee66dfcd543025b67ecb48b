AMAJITA will kick off their Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) proceedings against Niger at the Général Seyni Kountché Stadium on Saturday (5.30pm). They are in Group B with Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana. The tournament will last until 17 February. This is coach Thabo Senong’s quest to qualify for this year’s Fifa Under-20 World Cup. The Afcon tournament is open for any country to lift the trophy following the failure of last year’s winners, Zambia, to qualify for the showpiece. Amajita star midfielder Promise Mkhuma promises to use his blossoming skills to help the team qualify for the World Cup. Said Mkhuma: “We need to get six points in order to be safe. But the priority at this stage is to win the Afcon, and that will send a strong message to other teams. “I believe in teamwork. Nothing beats teamwork. There’s no pressure on us, we just need to stay focused. We did exceptionally well in the Cosafa Cup in December by retaining the title. But that’s in the past. Now our focus is on the big one.” In last year’s Cosafa, Mkhuma was voted the Player of the Tournament. Now the 18-year-old winger wants to continue where he left off – lead Amajita to the World Cup qualification in Poland. “Most of us in the team have never played in the World Cup before, and this is an opportunity,” he said. Senong will pin hopes on Malebogo Modise, Khulekani Kubheka and Kobamelo Kodisang. These are the only players who were part of the team that qualified and played in the South Korea World Cup last year. Kodisang, who plies his trade in Portugal, is confident they will make Mzansi proud. He said: “As players, we will do everything in our power to make the country proud.”
