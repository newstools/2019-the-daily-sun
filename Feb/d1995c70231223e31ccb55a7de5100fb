THE men in blue are mourning the loss of yet another member. Warrant Officer Mzomuhle Ngcobo (46), from Imbali in Pietermaritzburg, was shot dead by thugs while trying to help a neighbour. His brother Bonga Shelembe (49) said Ngcobo was off duty but didn’t think twice on Sunday when he heard a person screaming. “He took his firearm and went out. A few minutes later, gunshots were heard. We later discovered it was him who was being shot at by thugs.” Bonga said his brother really loved his job. He became a cop in 2000 and worked at various police stations across KZN. “At the time of his death, he was working at Townhill cop shop,” he said. Bonga said his family wanted his brother’s killers behind bars. “Every day you hear of a person who’s been shot and killed in the area. This makes us think there are many guns out there.” National police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said cases of murder and armed robbery were being investigated. “We can confirm he was responding to a call for help from his neighbour when he was shot and killed. “He sustained gunshot wounds to his neck and head. His firearm was also taken. Police are looking for the culprits.”
