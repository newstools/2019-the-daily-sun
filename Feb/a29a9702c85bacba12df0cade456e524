PEOPLE in this area have had enough! On Saturday, residents of Ridgeview in Durban blockaded the main road with mobile toilets, demanding RDPs. They told Daily Sun they have been living in the transit camp for 13 years. They said they won’t vote in May if they were not given RDPs. A resident said the mobile toilets had stopped working in September last year and they still haven’t been fixed. “The toilets have been leaking and the basins are broken.” He said the area had about 667 residents, and they were given 11 mobile toilets in September. “We were told to use the toilets while the container ones were being fixed. But at the end of September, people who were fixing the toilets left and never came back,” said the resident. “The mobile toilets are in a terrible condition.” Another resident said besides the terrible toilets, the transit camp was in a very bad condition and not suitable for anyone to live there. “We were moved from our shacks at Cato Crest in 2006. “We came to live in this camp while we waited for RDPs. But since we arrived no one has been given a house,” said the resident. “We vow not to vote for the ANC or any other party on election day.” Councillor Mveli Mthembu said he was in a meeting with the residents and couldn’t talk to Daily Sun.
