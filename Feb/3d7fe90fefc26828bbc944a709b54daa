A TEENAGER allegedly impregnated by her father tragically
died in a car accident on her way to court to see him sentenced for incest. Gift Alonge (17) was killed along with four others on 16
January on the way to the magistrate’s court in Benin City, Nigeria, Punch
reports. Three of the four others killed were key witnesses in the
incest trial. The fifth victim was the driver. Immediately after learning of the fatal car accident,
Jacob Alonge (54) changed his previous guilty plea to incest to not guilty. According to Punch, Jacob is an evil sangoma who had raped
his daughter on many occasions through the years. He allegedly caused her to
abort her first pregnancy by him in 2017 using his muthi. Her second pregnancy was noticed by her community in
December last year, which forced Jacob to go to the cops and admit his crime. Jacob pleaded guilty to the charges at the Evbuoraria
Magistrates’ Court in Benin City later in December, but did a dramatic U-turn
upon hearing about the fatal accident. The judgment was reportedly suspended when the court
heard about the tragedy. It is unclear from the report what difference Jacob’s
recent denial will make to the court’s judgement. Priscilla Usiobaifo is the founder of BraveHeart, an NGO
that had been supporting Gift as a young woman who had suffered abuse at the
hands of her father. Priscilla said: “I hereby call for justice for Gift
Alonge, as the Jacob Alonge changed his plea from guilty to not guilty after
learning about his daughter’s death, as well as the death of other key
witnesses. “I urge all civil rights activists, feminist sisters, NGO
colleagues and the Akoko-Edo community, especially the Ososo people, to rise to
the occasion and demand the much-desired justice.”
