COPS are warning people not to withdraw large amounts of money from banks. Thugs tend to follow unsuspecting victims, kidnap and rob them. Now they want people to be vigilant. Gogo Lina Gxulo from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni was one such victim. She was kidnapped, drugged and robbed of R20 000 in cash as she was coming out of a bank in Springs, Ekurhuleni. The suspects were caught a day later in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane. The evil, shameless thugs were charged with kidnapping, theft and robbery and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Accused Obakeng Letswalo (37), Nkosana Mathebula (37) and Khethani Makena (62) were sentenced in the Springs Magistrates Court last Friday. The excited Lina told Daily Sun it was her prayers that sent the thugs to jail. And the gogo was not only satisfied that justice had been served, she was happy that the suspects were given hefty sentences. Gogo said the events of that day still vivid in her mind as if it happened yesterday although it was two years ago. “I was approached by one of the suspect who was an older man. He told me he was selling chicken braai packs at a cheaper price.” “I didn’t suspect anything because he was older. He told me to go with him so I see them. “When we got there, they told me to sit in the car and one of them gave a drink. She passed out. “I woke in Far East hospital and I was told I had been picked up from the veld in Endicott near Springs, Ekurhuleni. Gogo was found a day later by a passerby dumped in the veld. Captain Johannes Ramphora told Daily Sun: “We commend the cops involved for a job well done.”
