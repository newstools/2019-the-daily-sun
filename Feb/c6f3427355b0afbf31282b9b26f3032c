Instead of frittering his time on Twitter fights, Port Elizabeth politics student Wandile Msomi has honed his skills in the fine art of diplomacy and international negotiation so well that he has been invited to New York to participate in the International Model UN (WIMUN) this week. After winning his section in the South African leg, as the "head" of the UK delegation in a simulated UN Security Council meeting in Pretoria, Msomi was selected to make the long journey to the Big Apple.  "I thought Johannesburg was the busiest city. ... this place is just too busy, 24-hours a day," he said after his first day there.   WIMUN participants are expected to be well versed and fluent in the topic and country that is assigned to them. At the simulated Security Council meeting in Pretoria, the topic was "Peace in West Africa". The gatherings are designed to be an accurate simulation of the UN, teaching students research, public speaking, debating, writing skills and cultural empathy. They must also read up on and familiarise themselves with the country assigned for each meeting.  Representatives from other universities in South Africa, such as the University of Cape Town, will also be in attendance. 'To my surprise, I was accepted in two days' In the first competition that the second-year Nelson Mandela University political science student won, he debated as a representative of Fiji, and was sent to the nationals in Pretoria.        'I'm rooting for him' He was elected more than two weeks ago and had early endorsements from his Lebanese, Turkish and Ghanaian delegates, as well as secret ballot endorsements. The opening plenary started on January 30, and the sitting lasts between January 31 and February 2. But he almost did not make it. His sister Wendy Nzama pulled out all the stops to take out loans and to raise funds, as she was determined that her brother would fulfill his dream of participating. "I'm rooting for him," the school teacher said, proudly showing off pictures he had sent of a trip to the Brooklyn Bridge and to the hallowed halls of the UN. Even pictures of the one pizza slice and New York "take out" he had budgeted for.
