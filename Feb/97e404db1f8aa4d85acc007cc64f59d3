WHEN a man was bust for allegedly stealing from residents for the third time, all hell broke loose. On Monday, a mob moered the alleged thief to death with stones, sticks and anything else they could lay their hands on. Residents of Madibeng Hills in Klipgat, North West, said they wanted to set an example to thugs that they would pay with their lives if they stole from them. They told Daily Sun the police didn’t take them seriously when they complained about the high crime rate in the area. One crime victim said: “We’ve been living in fear for too long. This boy has been making our lives hell.” But some residents condemned mob justice, saying people couldn’t just take the law into their own hands. Captain Sam Tselanyane confirmed the incident. “We’ve advised members of the community not to take the law into their own handsWhen they catch suspects, they must hand them over to the police,” he said. “They beat them with whatever they could lay their hands on until the suspects’ lifeless body was left lying on the dusty street,” he said. Tselanyane said a case of murder was opened and those responsible would face the law.
