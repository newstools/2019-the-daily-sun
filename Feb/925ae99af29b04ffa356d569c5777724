A FIGHT broke out between guards and thugs at a filling station in Ga-Kolopo Village outside Polokwane, Limpopo. This when thugs tried their luck. The robbers allegedly hooted at the gate and when no one responded, they cut open the fence, broke the door and stole groceries and cigarettes. Shooting occurred between the guards and thugs until the business owner arrived. The thugs attempted to shoot at him too during their escape. Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said:  the arrival of the owner resulted in a car chase until one of the suspects in a white Toyota Legend 45 lost control and came to a stop.“One suspect vanished on foot into the nearby bush, while another one was later found fatally wounded in a car. An unknown number of suspects fled the scene.” When cops arrived, they immediately started looking for the suspect who fled on foot and he was arrested at the local taxi rank through the assistance of community members,” said Ngoepe. A white Mercedes-Benz sedan was found abandoned a few kilometers from the crime scene after it collided with an object. “Our preliminary investigations have revealed that one of the getaway vehicles, a Toyota bakkie, was hijacked in Acornhoek, Mpumalanga. The second one, a Mercedes-Benz, was hijacked in Jane Furse, Limpopo,” he said. The arrested suspect will appear in the Matlala Magistrates Court soon on charges of business robbery, possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles, possession of suspected stolen properties and attempted murde. Ngoepe pleaded with anyone with information leading to the arrest of the remaining suspects to contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501. or the nearest police station.
