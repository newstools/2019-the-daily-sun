THERE is a very real possibility that the continuing rainfall could lead to flooding. The weather service has warned that most parts of the country will experience heavy rains over the weekend. Yesterday the South African Weather Service issued a warning in areas around Mogale City, Joburg, Ekurhuleni and the southern parts of Tshwane. A lot of rain has fallen in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, North West and parts of the Free State. Motorists and residents in low-lying areas have been warned to remain vigilant, especially around rivers. The weather service also warned of heavy rain and possible flooding in the northern and eastern parts of Limpopo today, as well as flooding in Gauteng. Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi urged residents: “Motorists must be careful and keep a safe following distance. “They should be on the lookout for pedestrians and school kids. “They must also avoid crossing flooded roads and bridges as vehicles can easily be swept away.” He urged squatter camp residents to examine water levels and move to higher ground as soon as there’s a need to do so. “Make sure young children stay away from streams and drainage pipes.”
