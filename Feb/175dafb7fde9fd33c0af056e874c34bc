RESIDENTS and patients were shocked to see a woman giving birth at a hospital gate. They said her waters broke while she was trying to get to the casualty ward at a hospital in Mankweng outside Polokwane, Limpopo, on Wednesday. A witness said the incident could have been avoided if nurses had arrived early. “It was shocking to see a helpless woman giving birth on the pavement. When nurses arrived at the gate, the baby was already visible. “They let her finish giving birth before they took her to the ward,” said the witness. Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said the woman’s waters broke after a taxi dropped her outside the hospital. “She was due to give birth and started having problems. Nurses were called to assist her at the hospital gate. This was not negligence, but an unfortunate situation. “She was later checked by our nurses after giving birth,” he said.
