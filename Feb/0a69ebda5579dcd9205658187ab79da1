“WE are
happy because now he realised that he will not get bail for killing rats with
two legs.” This were
the words of Anna Nhlapho, of a neighbour to the Vlakfontein house where 7
people were killed.  Nhlapho told
Daily Sun that when they asked what the smell that was coming from the house was
for, he said he had killed rats.  “He must
now realise that the rat with two legs will cause him not to get bail," said Nhlapho.   “If we give you bail, people will lose trust in the justice system.” These were the words of the magistrate David Mhango when denied bail to Fita Khupe, the man accused of killing 7 people and burying them inside the house. Khupe appeared in court on Monday. Ernest Vusi Mabaso, one of the two men accused of killing seven people in Vlakfontein, south of Joburg, last year, has committed suicide on January 24.
