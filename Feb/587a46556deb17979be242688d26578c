ELISA Mdaka was delighted when she had a baby girl in July last year. The 44-year-old from Block 11 at Ga-Mokgwathi Village, outside Bolobedu in Limpopo, said her excitement quickly turned to sorrow. This happened when her five-month-old baby, Hloniphani, struggled to sleep on 14 January at about 1am. She said she took her child to Mokgwathi Clinic but was not happy with the assistance she got. “When I arrived at the clinic the nurse on duty checked my daughter and said she had a fever, but I could see that she was suffering. The nurse gave me three bottles of medicine and told me to go home and come back at 8am,” she said. Elisa said she pleaded with the nurse to call an ambulance to take her daughter to Letaba Hospital but was told ambulances do not operate at that time of the night. “I went back home. My child was still struggling to breathe even after I gave her the medicine. I also tried to get transport to the hospital but I couldn’t find it,” said Elisa. At about 7am, she went back to the clinic. “The nurse checked her and I was told that she had died. I’m heartbroken and I blame the clinic for the death of my child. I have buried her but even today I don’t know what killed her.” Limpopo Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana failed to respond to our messages and his phone rang unanswered.
