UMLAZI cops are hunting a 30-year-old suspect who escaped after being sentenced to eight years in the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Thursday. Siphiwe Faku allegedly overpowered a cop who was escorting him to the court cells and fled. Faku was sentenced for kidnapping and assault. Court manager Sheryl Nel said the suspect was under police guard and there was nothing the court could say about the matter. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said Faku overpowered a police man and assaulted him before pushing through the gate and fleeing. She said Umlazi police have opened a case of escape from lawful custody and assault. “Members of the public are advised to contact their local police station if they spot the suspect or if they know of his whereabouts. They can contact Umlazi Police Station on 031 908 0089 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111,” said Gwala. She said Faku was arrested at Eziko Reserve in KwaMakhutha, south of Durban in 2017, after stabbing and assaulting a man.
