PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng said God spoke to him and told him to fight witchcraft. “God told me to use just water and soil to bust them and free people,” said the prophet of the Incredible Happenings Ministries in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. “If a person is troubled by witches they should bring soil taken from their yard and water,” he said. Then he will pray for them and tell them what to do when they get home. “Things will happen. Witches will come out themselves to confess. They will point at themselves,” he said. This Friday night he will be holding a service where people can bring soil and water and he will pray for them. People who need to bust witches in their homes should bring these items before 9pm. “The God I serve never lies. He does what He says and I believe he will catch the witches,” he said. Gogo Sibongile Ndlovu (61) from Orlando East, Soweto, said nothing goes right for her and her family. “No one is working and my children are dying. “It’s time I see who is bewitching me. Maybe they’ll tell me why they hate me.”
