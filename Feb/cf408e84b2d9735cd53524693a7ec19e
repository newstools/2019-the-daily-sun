WHILE honest residents and business owners sat in the dark last week, thugs saw an opportunity for a quick buck. After Eskom announced the return of load shedding, cable thieves rushed to nearby substations to take whatever they could lay their hands on. Joburg City Power said: “During load shedding, cables were stolen by thieves taking advantage of the power being off. “We also had several mini substations and pole-mounted transformers popping and exploding due to the sudden rush of power when electricity was restored.” City Power CEO Lerato Setshedi said most of the equipment is old and load shedding just made their problems worse. On Friday morning, City Power staff attended to at least 400 calls from customers across the City of Joburg. They said the rainy weather added to their difficulties. “Communities must bear with us as we try and reverse this. We have pulled out all our resources to ensure each and every one of these complaints is attended to,” said Setshedi.
