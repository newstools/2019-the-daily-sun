HE SINGS the type of music that turns an ordinary date into a romantic one. “But that’s just my work,” said Jabulani Hadebe (35), better known as Sjava. He said anything that is planned is fake. “Any setting with my woman is romantic.” Sjava, the 2018 BET Viewers’ Choice Best International Act Award winner, was speaking on Kaya FM on Tuesday as he shared his life with the listeners. “I believe in love. But I have to figure out what being a romantic means,” he said. “My grandfather taught me how to approach a woman but we were not told how to take care of the woman after finding her.” He said the rules of dating confuse everyone and this leads to break-ups. The Uthando hit singer said picnicking and parks are not his scene. “Maybe one day I will be that person but it’s not something that interests me now.”
