THE Morajane family held a funeral without a body on Saturday. This was after the family found the body of gogo Emily Morajane (89) in a bad state at the funeral parlour. The family said the undertaker failed to keep gogo’s body frozen after they paid R24 000 for the service. Gogo’s niece Melly Nyember (45) from Memel, Free State said they were forced to take the body straight from the mortuary to the cemetery. “On Friday, I went to the mortuary to wash and dress the body for the funeral. I was shocked. She was lying on the table and worms were coming out of her body. The smell was unbearable. “I demanded answers from the undertaker, who told me he ran out of gas for the fridge. I don’t understand why this wasn’t communicated to the family.” She said they told mourners there was no body. “It is important in our culture to verify a body belongs to us but it was taken away from us. “I couldn’t even recognise her. I want the undertaker to pay us back.” Melly said after mourners left, they collected the body and buried it. The family has since learned the funeral parlour has been closed. Councillor Thoko Matrima said: “The family told us about the matter and when we got to the parlour, it was closed. We’ll call the health department to investigate.” Daily Sun called the undertaker but he avoided calls and switched off his phone.
