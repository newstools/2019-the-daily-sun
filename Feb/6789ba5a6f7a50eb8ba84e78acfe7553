A HUNTER who was arrested for killing a farm worker has been sentenced to six years’ imprisonment. Stefan Hepburn was sentenced in the Modimolle Magistrates Court on Tuesday after being found guilty of culpable homicide. Hepburn shot and killed Jan Railwa (23) at Tuinplaas farm outside Modimolle in 2017. Hepburn claimed he mistook Railwa for a warthog. Limpopo police commissioner General Nneke Ledwaba welcomed the sentence. He warned hunters to properly identify their targets before pulling the trigger. “The sentence should serve as a wake-up call to all the people who are making use of firearms. “Any form of negligence will not be tolerated,” he said. “We would also like to commend the team led by Captain Richard Boshomane for leaving no stone unturned.”
