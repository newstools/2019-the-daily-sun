A COUPLE who had decided never to have kids were utterly
shocked when they bust the man’s mum poking holes in their condoms. And now their plans are shattered – because she’s
pregnant! According to New Zealand Herald, an unnamed woman posted
the details of her terrible experience on Reddit. “We are in our late 20s and we enjoy our carefree lives
so much that we decided that we thought it would be best to never have
kids," she wrote. On a recent Christmas day, the woman mentioned their
decision to her mamazala, who "went into hysterics, worried her bloodline
and family name will die". It made for an awkward Christmas, but the couple forgot
about it. Then the mamazala offered to come around and help out by
making dinner for the couple one night. The woman was still at work, and the
mamazala sent her son out to get some ingredients from the shop. While the man was still out shopping, the woman returned
home. She went straight to her bedroom to change her clothes. "When I opened the door into our bedroom I saw my
mamazala carefully trying to poke holes into our condoms," she wrote. "She snapped her head in my direction looking like a
fish out of water. "She mumbled something about how she's 'trying to
save the family' and frantically ran out of the house before I even had a
chance to say anything." The mamazala got into her car and roared away. Although the shocked couple threw away the punctured
condoms, it turns out the mamazala must have been doing this for a while,
because the woman is now expecting a baby. In a new post on Reddit, the woman wrote: "I'm so unhappy
that I haven't been able to sleep in the last four days. I've been in a really
dark place. "I can't believe I'm in this situation right now. I
don't know what I'm going to do."
