PITCH Black Afro’s case could be struck off the roll. Magistrate Piet du Plessis warned that if pathologists, who didn’t pitch in court yesterday, wasn’t there for the next court date, he would strike the matter off the roll. He told prosecutor Mzamo Mathe to summon the pathologist to ensure he attended court. “If he continues like this, he will be arrested.” The pathologist was supposed to testify on whether wife Tricia Modisane was hurt before or after she went to the B&B where her body was found. The case was postponed to 14 March. If it is struck off the roll, Pitch Black will be set free while cops keep investigating. The musician, whose real name is Thulani Ngcobo, blew a kiss at people seated at the gallery when the postponement date was given. His lawyer Mishack Maluleke said: “The pathologist wasn’t in court for reasons which weren’t convincing.”
