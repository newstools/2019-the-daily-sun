ACCORDING to neighbours, the mum of three was at a tavern on Saturday night when they saw flames coming out of her shack. “We tried to rescue the kids,” said a resident. “We managed to get two out. One was burned to death.” The neighbours rushed the two kids to hospital. Residents of Makau, North West, claimed the mum often left her three kids unminded. “They’re very young, and it’s not safe for them to be on their own,” said a neighbour. The kids’ mum, Maite Mabato, said she was at her boyfriend’s place and had to leave the kids with a friend. “My friend went to the shop, and when she came back the shack was on fire. It all happened so fast,” said the mum. Another neighbour claimed her children told her they saw a masked man pouring petrol over the shack, setting it alight and driving off. But the mum insisted that she was a good parent and that some of her neighbours were trying to make her look bad. Police spokeswoman Captain Aafje Botma said an inquest docket was opened. “The cause of the fire is unknown at this stage. Police are investigating,” she said.
