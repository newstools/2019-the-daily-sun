GAUTENG Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has won another battle. On Tuesday, Lesufi took to Twitter to celebrate the decision by Legislature to approve his department’s amendments to school admission regulations. “We’ve restored the dignity of the African child with the approval of the new school admissions regulations. “No pupil will be discriminated against on the basis of language, race, health, financial status or where they were born,” Lesufi wrote on Twitter. Spokesman Steve Mabona said they worked hard on the amendments. “Last year we conducted consultative sessions with communities on the amendments,” said Mabona. Among the amendments to the admission regulations are measures ensuring all pupils have equal access to schools, that the head of department is responsible for admissions, and that admissions are done in a manner free from unfair discrimination. Last year, AfriForum called for the scrapping of the regulations. They had concerns with a number of amendments, including SGBs having less power. Lesufi said new regulations brought an end to practices where schools would racially separate pupils in the name of language. “Apartheid is painful,” he said. “To be told your child can’t go to this school because of a certain race alone can’t be condoned.”
