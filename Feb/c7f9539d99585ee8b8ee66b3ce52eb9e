PROPHET Shepherd Bushiri told the CRL Commission that he doesn’t charge people when they come to pray – but social media has declared him a liar. After Bushiri, the leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering, made the declaration to the commission, people came out in numbers to tell how they had paid him for prayers that didn’t even work. The commission is investigating the death of three people at a church gathering on 28 December last year. “I am still in debt and haven’t received any miracle money.” “She died few months later.” “I’m still unemployed,” he said.
