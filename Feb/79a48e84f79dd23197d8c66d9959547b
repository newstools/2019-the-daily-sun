Kwaito’s self-proclaimed godmother, Mshoza wants to use music to bring Dj Cleo and Boity together, after the two had a major fallout on twitter earlier this week.  Read the full story here: ANGER OVER DJ CLEO AND BRICKZ REUNION! The Kwaito star tweeted that she'd like to unite in song with the two bickering artists, in order to fight against gender based violence. “I call upon the likes of @djcleo1 @Boity and others to unite in song and fight against abuse, rape and gender based violence in our country. Let the music heal the nation once more. Black twitter let us risewhen that song is out. With Love #mshoza the GodMother #gbv”, she tweeted. Mshoza's fans expressed happiness and some even had a few suggestions. “Kortes I like the idea but I'm not really sure about the song part, unless its a combination of you and DjCleo. It would be a bomb,” Siyabonga Lawrence tweeted. “Dankie cherry. Really I miss having artist who unite in song to get a massage across. We had that with the older generation yabo Brenda Fassie, Tshepo Tshola etc and the message was delivered to the masses . I hope it this happens,” Mafungase Hadebe tweeted. But some fans where uncertain if this was the best idea. “Music leads with people who humble themselves and respect people more especially fan. Not some Thokoza uGogo @Boity who goes around insulting people,” @Gobosamang tweeted.
