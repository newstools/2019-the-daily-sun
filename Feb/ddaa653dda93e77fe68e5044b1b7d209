RESIDENTS were eagerly looking forward to moving into RDP houses this year. But their excitement was short-lived because the houses have now been demolished. Several have already been destroyed while 20 more will soon follow. This comes after eThekwini Municipality inspected the houses in Zitholeni. They apparently found the concrete foundations for the RDPs built in October were not properly made. A resident whose house was demolished told Daily Sun that municipal officials told her the house would start cracking within two years. “I’m really disappointed about this. The house was built for us in October and we were expecting to move in this month. We now have to wait for another one to be built.” Another resident said he had a family of 12 and his house was too small for everyone to fit in. “We have been waiting for the RDPs to be completed for several years. When they were finished, we thought we would finally sleep comfortably. But now we will have to wait many more years.” He said they hoped the rebuilding would not take too long. “I’m unemployed and can’t afford to build a house. This RDP would make a difference to my family.” Councillor Themba Shelembe said the houses would be rebuilt.
