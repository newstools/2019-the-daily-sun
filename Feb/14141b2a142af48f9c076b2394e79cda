FOR 19 years, Matlodi Mothiba (48) from Durban has been jobless and struggling to make ends meet. But now she has found out that, according to education department records, she earns R122 000 a year! When her son applied to NSFAS, his funding was unsuccessful. He discovered that someone was getting money using his mum’s name. Matlodi suspects someone is getting paid by the KZN Department of Education, using her name. “I’m really confused. I stopped working for the department in 2000. I had been in hospital, and when I went back to work I had been replaced by another teacher,” she said. She said she was told to go to the department and ask them to write a letter to the school. “The department didn’t take my case seriously, and I’ve been sitting at home jobless since then,” she said. “I’ve been enquiring with the department in our district regarding my case but they don’t attend to it.” Daily Sun sent an inquiry to KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi on 27 January and he acknowledged receiving it. Several phone calls followed and he promised to get back to the SunTeam. On Sunday, Mahlambi said he was still waiting for a response from the district office. Yesterday, he didn’t pick up his phone.
