HOT, dry weather conditions have left many municipalities struggling for water. Sarah Baartman mayor Khunjuzwa Kekana urged residents to use water wisely. She said all seven of their municipalities were affected by the drought and a dangerous heat wave. “This has resulted in dangerously low water levels at dams and holding areas. For health and safety reasons residents are advised to boil water before using it.” Water and sanitation spokesman Sputnik Ratau said: “The little bit of rain received in the last few days has not made a significant difference to dam levels. There was an improvement of 2% in the provincial average.” Ratau said according to the department’s weekly reports, dam levels were at a worrying 58%.
