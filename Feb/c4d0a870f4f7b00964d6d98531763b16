BUYISWA Gqoli (57) has proven that dedication and hard work are all one needs to beat the odds. Buyiswa from KwaBhaca, Mount Frere, contracted TB of the spine at the age of six and has been wheelchair-bound ever since. But music has always kept her going. “I sang in the choir at school, in church and in hospital,” she said. Buyiswa released an album titled Soze Ndakhohlwa in November. She started working on her album after she fought breast cancer in 2016. “I was given a second chance and used it to realise my dream of releasing my own album. The songs were inspired by the presence of God and my experiences as a person living with a disability. When I sing it doesn’t feel like I have a disability. “Singing has carried me through difficult situations.” Buyiswa encouraged SunReaders, especially young people living with disabilities, to stay true to themselves. She said she was encouraged by the likes of Umhlobo Wenene FM presenter Spitch Nzawumbi. “I want to encourage the youth to never give up and always believe that things will work out.”
