KZN Health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo encouraged hundreds of young health professionals to leave their comfort zones. Dhlomo said this at the orientation and induction of 268 students from various universities around Mzansi. They began their 12-month community service this year. Dhlomo said he felt compelled to encourage the group. He said most of the services offered by the group are hard to come by in rural areas. “Allowing these young people to go to rural areas decreases the need for hypertension and diabetes patients to travel to urban areas,” said Dhlomo. “The value of students going to rural areas is enormous. It will have a huge impact on rural citizens’ quality of life.” He said being exposed to different cultures and languages would be beneficial to the community service officers, as they will become well-rounded citizens. Frieda Maritz, who studied dentistry at the University of Pretoria, worked at Ekhombe Hospital before being transferred to Hlengisizwe Clinic in Hammarsdale. “I’m happy to be outside Durban,” she said. “Ekhombe was rural, but being there was quite an experience. I learnt a lot about my job. “I’m looking forward to learning Zulu, getting to know the residents better and making a difference.” This year’s group of community service officers is made up of dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists and audiologists.
