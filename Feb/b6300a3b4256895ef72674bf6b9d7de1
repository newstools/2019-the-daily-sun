NTOMBI is asking Daily Sun to help her find her brother. Karel Ndlovu (48) went missing in 2006, and Ntombi (45) from Soshanguve extension 7, Tshwane, said her brother lived in Ga-rankuwa zone 16. She said her brother was an evangelist at Grace Bible Church. “It’s been a while since we last saw him,” she said. He left his daughter behind. According to Ntombi, her brother had told her he was going to Durban with other church members. But when she asked the church members, they didn’t know about the trip. They received a call from someone in Durban who said Karel had fallen ill. But they lost contact with the person. In 2017 someone from Cape Town informed them her brother was in the Eastern Cape. Ntombi is worried that something bad has happened to her. She wants to tell him about their mother’s death in November 2014. “He must come home as we always dream of him being around. This hurts us a lot. We don’t know what he eats or where he sleeps,” she said. “Please, Daily Sun. Help us find our brother,” said Ntombi. Police confirmed that a missing persons case was opened.
