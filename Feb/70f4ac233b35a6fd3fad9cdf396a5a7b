RESIDENTS are worried about the safety of patients at KwaMhlanga Hospital in Mpumalanga. This after a madala in hospital pyjamas was found wandering the streets. Maria Lekuloane (55) from Zakheni Village said she found the madala eating wild fruit and soil on Friday morning. “I was going to look for my cattle when I came across the madala. I greeted him and asked what his surname was, but he didn’t answer me. “Then my neighbour and I tried to call an ambulance, but we were told there were none available. We called the police station, but were told all the vans were out. “We then called the ward councillor, who told us to call the cops as he was busy,” said Maria. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “The patient was bought back to the hospital unharmed at about 1pm. He was assessed and re-admitted.” He said the department will investigate how the patient was able to leave.
