THIS area has become a haven for mosquitoes and flies because of rubbish on the street. Residents of Mabopane block M, Tshwane, keep windows and doors closed at all times, claiming people dump rubbish on open spaces. Gogo Virginia Mohajane (64), who lives near the illegal dumpsite, said: “At first only a few people threw their rubbish there and the municipality failed to collect it. But it soon became a dump filled with bags of rubbish.” Virginia said the rubbish was making her family sick. “We can’t enjoy our food anymore because of the smell. “It’s disgusting and we can’t even have visitors because of the smell and insects.” Another resident, gogo Maria Modiba (65), said he confronted many residents who dumped their rubbish there. “They just keep dumping their rubbish there, even though I’ve warned them about their bad behaviour.” They complained about the matter to the municipality, but nothing happened. “The municipality didn’t even give us a reference number,” she said. The municipality has in the past admitted rubbish is a big problem in the area. But it said municipal workers do collect it on a regular basis.
