FOR years Ratshimphi Mavhina and his family have lived a life of misery in abject poverty. The 70-year-old of Mbilwi in Thohoyandou, Limpopo shared two dilapidated rooms with his five children who are grown up for years. But at the weekend, all this came to an end when two businessmen handed over a five-roomed, fully furnished house to the family. Brothers Collen and Cecil Mashawana of Afribiz Invest said their company took a decision to assist poor people, especially the elderly and disabled. “Last year, we built 15 houses which we distributed countrywide. Our target this year is to double the number,” he said. The madala could not hide his excitement. “God is great. Life was bad for us but we thank these good Samaritans who thought of us and build us this beautiful house,” he said. Kunene Makope Risk Solutions insured the house and its contents for free. The family also received free life cover. Star Set gave the family a new TV set with a free 12 month DStv subscription.
