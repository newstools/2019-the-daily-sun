YET another viral video of pupils fighting at school has shocked the nation. The latest one shows a boy moering a girl at Lyttelton Manor High School in Centurion, Tshwane. In the video, the two exchange blows until the girl falls to the ground. Fellow pupils can be heard screaming for the boy to stop as he puts his knee to her throat. The incident happened last Friday and the girl apparently started the fight. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona condemned the incident. He said the parents of both pupils were called to the school to discuss disciplinary processes. Mabona said both pupils were suspended on Monday and will appear before a disciplinary hearing next week. Psychologists were sent to the school to support all affected pupils. Mabona said investigations revealed a fellow grade 7 pupil had threatened to distribute nude videos of her. The pupil reported the bully to a teacher last Thursday.
