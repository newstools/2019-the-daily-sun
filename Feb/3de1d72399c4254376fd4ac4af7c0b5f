Two suspects between the ages of 23 and 29 were bust for armed robbery at Bekezela squatter camp in Newtown, Joburg. They and four accomplices allegedly robbed three men riding bicycles on Henry Nxumalo Street on Sunday. They allegedly took out knives, scratched one of the victims and fled on the bicycles. One of the victims accompanied cops and pointed the two suspects out. However, the bicycles have not yet been found. Metro police spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said the car had no front number plates. “On running the vehicle identification number, the BMW came up as a vehicle stolen a couple of months ago in Lenasia, south of Joburg.” The 40-year-old driver was bust for possession of a stolen vehicle.
