DO YOU know how to deal with toxic workplace gossip? We have all heard secret stories about a boss or
colleague. Sometimes they inform us of issues we need to know but many are
nasty. They serve no purpose but to harm the image and reputations of the
people being discussed. Helene Vermaak, director or The Human Edge, said: “When

by your silence – you are being tacit.” The stories of our

peers. No one wakes up wanting to be an evil villain. But to cope with life’s

relationships to others, so why do it?
