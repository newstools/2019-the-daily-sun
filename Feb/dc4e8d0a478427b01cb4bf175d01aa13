The State Capture Commission has heard of the threats that journalist who wrote about Bosasa received. News24 Editor In Chief Adriaan Basson, told the commission that after he wrote a story about Bosasa in January 2009, he began getting telephonic threats. He explained to the commission that the information that was used on the story he had written was verified. Basson said they checked the metadata on the information received on an e-mail, which confirmed that the emails originated from Bosasa. According to Basson the story caused discomfort at Bosasa, which subsequently led to the threats. He says following that he started receiving calls during the day and night. Basson detailed how he started saving the numbers under the names "Bosasa Angry 1" or "Bosasa Angry 2". He said at some point the people who called him used swear words like: "Stop your s**t, stop writing your s**t." Meanwhile Basson said: “IF you become a journalist, it comes with a territory that you have to have a thick skin. I tried to explain the purpose of a journalist in this country. The poor are the ultimate victims of corruption.” Basson told the commission that it didn’t stop with the swear words, they also threatened his family. He says he was once called by a woman who read out his ID number on the phone and they also named members of his family. "My conclusion, this was a Bosasa to scare and intimidate me," Basson said.
