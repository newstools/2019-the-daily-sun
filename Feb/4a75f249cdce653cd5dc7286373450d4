A man was injured after being thrown from taxi in
Johannesburg because of his behavior. The man was apparently
intoxicated and was causing fights with every passenger in the taxi. This took place last night in Sandton, Johannesburg. “The intoxicated man was injured when he was flung from a
minibus taxi after causing trouble with other passengers in Sandton,
Johannesburg on Saturday night,” paramedics said. The man was assessed on the scene by an advanced life
support paramedic and found to be in a stable condition. Daily Sun spoke to a taxi driver to ask about some issues
experienced in the taxi and it seems like drunkards are always the problem. Some do not even allow them in their Taxis. A taxi driver from Benoni, Mandla Nkosi said he does not
allow drunkards in his taxi. “They are very unruly. I am a very short tempered man and I
do not want to show my passengers the other side of me so I just avoid them,”
said Mandla. Mandla also urged passengers  not to take taxis if they know  they become a problem when drunk.
