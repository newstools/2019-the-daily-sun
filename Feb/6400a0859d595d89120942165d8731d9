DA officials were told to voetsak by a school principal! Khume Ramulifho, a DA member of the Gauteng Legislature, MP Patrick Atkinson and local councillor Kishore Badal were set to visit Apex Primary School in Lenasia on Monday as part of an oversight visit. But when they arrived, the principal told them he’d received word from his superiors telling him not to allow the visit. The officials said they wanted to visit the school after complaints from concerned parents about overcrowding and issues with infrastructure and hygiene. Community leader Fehme Gani said: “Parents said their kids were getting sick because of the poor state of the school toilets.” Ramulifho said they went to the school to find out for themselves what was happening. “We wanted to find out if the school is receiving the budget they need from the department. If not, we wanted to find out what we could do to help get the budget to ensure the school was maintained,” said Ramulifho. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said overcrowding was nothing new at Gauteng schools. He said the department would look into why DA officials were not allowed an oversight visit.
