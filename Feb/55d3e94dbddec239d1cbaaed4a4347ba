WHEN he met a gorgeous lady online, he was sure he had hit
the jackpot. But the man, who doesn’t want to be identified, ended up sad
and disappointed. The man from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: “The way
she talked and the things she liked made me think she was the woman of my
dreams.” The man said he met the woman online in October last year
and they had been chatting to each other since then. “We ended up arranging to meet last weekend. The plan was that
she would come to my place and we would have fun,” he said. The man said they talked about the nasty things they wanted
to do to each other and he was ready to impress her. However, when the day came
from the lady to visit him from Bethlehem, Free State, she left him hanging. He said on the day she was meant to visit, he went to buy
imbiza and drank it in preparation. “I wanted to give her the best poke of her life,” he said. However, the lady never pitched up and disappeared with the
taxi money he had sent her. He said she left him hanging and unable to sort
himself out. “I sent her my last R150 for her to catch a taxi. She kept
on telling me she was in the taxi but she never arrived. She is a tsotsi,” he
said. The man said he was left with a broken heart and a painful
4-5. “All I want is my money back. She can keep her punani,” he
said. He shared the woman’s contact details with Daily Sun and she
said she was just teaching him a lesson.
