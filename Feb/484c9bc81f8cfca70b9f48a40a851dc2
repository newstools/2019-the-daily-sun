THE R1 rapist will spend the rest of his life behind bars. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Ndumiso Ntumba was sentenced to life imprisonment last week for raping a seven-year-old child in the Belgrade area of Pongola. The 29-year-old was found guilty in the Pongola Regional Court for the crime committed on Christmas Day in 2017. Mbele said Ntumba pounced on the victim after sending the kids she was playing with outside to a nearby spaza shop. “While they ran to the shop, he took the victim into his room and raped her,” said Mbele. She said after he was done, Ntumba gave the child R1 to keep quiet, but the victim went home and told her mum what had happened. A case of rape was opened at the Pongola cop shop. Mbele said the sentence should send a strong message to other suspects who think they can get away with committing crime. “The law has no resting time, just like criminals don’t. We will keep working overtime to nab these criminals,” she said. Parents must stand up as soon as something happens and the law will deal with it,” she said. Mbele encouraged parents not to keep quiet when things like this happened to their kids. Mbele praised the detectives who worked on the case for ensuring Ntumba faced the full might of the law.
