A GROUP of Chesterville youths stopped their councillor from building a skate park yesterday. The material for skateboarders was brought to the sports ground by the councillor on Friday. But those who use the grounds vowed they would not allow construction to proceed. Musa Maphisa, the co-ordinator of indigenous games, said they were not against the skate park but didn’t want it there. “Hundreds of young people play different sports here,” she said. “It is the only place where they can gather for practice sessions and tournaments. “When the councillor brought the material for the new project, where did he think we would go? “This space is important to us and we will not allow it to be taken away as it keeps the youth off the streets.” Thembelihle Mngadi (21) said: “We want the councillor to take the project somewhere else because this is our space. “We have been using it for a long time and we have important games coming up soon.” When contacted yesterday, ward councillor Sifiso Mngadi asked to be called later, but his cellphone rang unanswered.
