MASKED students tried to shut down Wits University entrances yesterday morning. Tension was high as protesters tried to fight with private security guards at the Empire Road entrance to the main campus in Braamfontein, while stones were scattered at the Yale Road entrance. SRC chairwoman Sisanda Mbolekwa told the police to leave students alone. “We are not fighting anyone, but you’re here fighting with us and roughing us up. We are your children. Some don’t have places to sleep and others aren’t registered,” she said. University spokeswoman Buhle Zuma said about 50 masked students blocked entrances and tried to disrupt lectures. The protest was sparked by the university’s refusal to register students carrying debt from the year before.
