FUMING residents of Schoemansdal near Malelane, Mpumalanga, set alight a man accused of practising Satanism. The man was burnt on Wednesday evening by an angry mob that stormed his home. They asked him why he and his family were still living in the kasi even though they were ordered to leave. DA councillor Nomusa Mathobela said the community acted in anger. Mathobela said residents should have let the police handle the matter instead of taking the law into their own hands. The man’s family is believed to have gone in hiding. Police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said two men and a woman, aged between 28 and 45, were arrested for assaulting and setting the man alight. Bhembe said a man came to the police station in the early hours of Thursday morning and said he had been assaulted by the three but managed to escape. The man said when he left the scene the three suspects were assaulting his brother. Police went to the scene and certified the man’s brother dead. Bhembe said the suspects were expected to appear in the Tonga Magistrates Court. He urged members of the public to report criminals to the police and to let the law take its course.
