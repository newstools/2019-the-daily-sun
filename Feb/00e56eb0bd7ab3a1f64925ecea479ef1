RESIDENTS of Lotus Park squatter camp in Gugulethu, Cape Town, are angry that their shacks were demolished on Valentine’s Day. Sam’kelo Lufuno (28) said they were surprised when city officials came to destroy their shacks. “They came during the day and didn’t say anything to us,” he said. “We weren’t given the opportunity to take anything because they told us we’d be shot if we fought.” Cingelwa Mnqungu (35) said most of the residents were unemployed. “We used our grant money to build homes, but the city destroyed everything we owned. “The worst part is that they made sure we won’t be able to reuse the material we built our shacks with,” said Cingelwa. Bulelani Gubela (32) said officials came back to their kasi on Friday. “On Thursday they told us they had made a mistake. They said they had been sent to Lotus River,” he said. Bulelani said he didn’t believe they made a mistake because they came back the following day to demolish more shacks. “These people are playing with us. They went as far as asking for our names and ID numbers so they could replace the building material they took.” Cape Town human settlements MMC Malusi Booi said: “On Thursday and Friday, the city’s law enforcement agencies removed unoccupied structures that were illegally erected in Lotus Park. “The city condemns the violence that occurred in the area and the damage to infrastructure. “I will meet leaders in Gugulethu to discuss the best interests of the community.”
