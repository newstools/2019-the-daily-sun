THE beautiful Peugeot 208 is here to inject a little bit of
pleasure and youthfulness in the small hatch segment. The last generation car was a good car, but it wasn’t
necessarily exciting. The new Polo rival is a whole lot exciting to look at and
Peugeot is promising that it will be fun to drive too. Like other cars in the range, the new 208 is looking to move
more up market. It brings features like 3D head-up displays, Peugeot’s
i-Cockpit and a number of driving aids usually preserved for cars higher up the
class. The new car is wider, longer and lower than the outgoing
model. It gets Peugeot’s new signature Full LED 3-claw headlight design. The rear also gets the new black band running over the width
of the boot lid just like in the 3008. The new car will be available with petrol, diesel and
electric powertrains from the onset. One 1.2-litre petrol engine will be available with three
power outputs 56, 75 and 97kW, there’s also the diesel 75kW 1.5-litre diesel. Two transmission options will be available for the 75kW
petrol option, a 5-speed manual and an 8-speed automatic. The least powerful
option only gets the manual transmission and the most powerful is only
available with the auto. Then there’s the e-208, it features a 100kW electric motor
which is powered by a 50kWh battery, good for a claimed 340 km range. The battery can be charged up to 80% on a dedicated public
charging terminal, 16 hours on a conventional wall socket and about 5 hours
with a wall box. The 208 is still on the local Peugeot website, so we expect
to see this French beauty on our shores next year when it launches. But with
our Eishkom problems, we expect only the petrol and diesel to make it.
