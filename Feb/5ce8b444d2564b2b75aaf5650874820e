A MENTALLY ill patient was apparently turned away from a Port Elizabeth hospital on two occasions. The family of Govuza Makhosi (61) from Motherwell claims he was turned away from Dora Nginza Hospital. The family said madala Govuza was first sent home on 8 and 9 January, and when he went back again on 22 and 23 January doctors again refused to admit him. His brother Monwabisi Makhosi (49) said: “I took Govuza to the hospital but doctors said there was nothing wrong with him and told him to go home.” He said he provided doctors with Govuza’s medical file, including a discharge report from Tower Psychiatric Hospital, Fort Beaufort, where he was a patient for more than 30 years. “They ignored that,” said Monwabisi. Govuza’s family said they can’t send him back to Tower because he was discharged last year. “We have to take him to a local hospital’s emergency room, which is what we were trying to do,” said Monwabisi. Health spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said: “Govuza’s condition does not require admission. Patients are only admitted when their condition requires in-house treatment. The family can visit the hospital’s CEO for more details.” He said Govuza must stick to his treatment and his family must support him.
