Nirvana Drive in Lenasia, Johannesburg, has been closed off due to protests in the area. This is after residents of Lenasia Extension 1 barricaded roads with rocks and burning tyres following the removal of illegal electricity connections. A number of exposed wires used to connect electricity illegally from street lights along Lenasia Drive were removed. On Tuesday morning, City Power along with the police and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa conducted a joint operation in the area to remove illegal connections.  Police spokesperson Captain Hector Netshivodza said the R558 was also affected by the protest. He added that no arrests were made and police were monitoring the situation.  City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said protesting residents wanted to reconnect the cables that were removed during the joint campaign.  He said the illegal connections posed a danger to residents, especially those who cross the railway line to a nearby informal settlement.  "We did this campaign early this morning and several exposed wires and cables were taken. We believe it was a success even though there were people threatening to protest," Mangena said.  Illegal connections costing City millions Mangena said despite the protests, the City would continue with similar operations, which would also target more upmarket suburbs. "There are illegal connections in suburbs and there are also illegal connections done by big companies and in townhouses," said Mangena. He said these connections were costing the City millions.  "At least R2bn is lost annually through illegal connections and this is the money that could have gone to build or electrify more suburbs," said Mangena. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/protesters-barricade-road-after-disconnections-of-stolen-electricity-in-lenasia-20190219
