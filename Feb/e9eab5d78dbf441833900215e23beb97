POLICE are working round the clock to deal with poachers. Two men believed to be syndicate members were arrested on Monday in Hoedspruit, outside Phalaborwa, for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. The men, aged 30 and 37, were nabbed during a sting operation made up of the tactical response and rhino poaching task teams. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said swift reaction by police led to the recovery of a Polo Vivo with four occupants. “Two suspects fled and ran towards a Toyota Hilux believed to be their second car. “They sped off, leaving the Polo and their two accomplices behind. A chase ensued until the Toyota Hilux was found abandoned along the R537 road. It had overturned and was damaged, but no one was inside.” Ngoepe said a rifle, a silencer, a pair of binoculars, nine rounds of ammunition, three knives, three cellphones, bags, worksuits and a knife filer were recovered. “The suspects will appear in the Hoedspruit Magistrate Court soon.”
