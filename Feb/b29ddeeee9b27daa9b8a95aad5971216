A YOUNG woman who encouraged her boyfriend to kill
himself has been sentenced to jail time. According to the Sun, Michelle Carter (22) from
Massachusetts, America was dating Conrad Roy, then 18, in 2014. Both suffered from depression and Conrad had previously
tried to kill himself. In dozens of sms’s heard during her 2017 trial that
gripped the nation’s attention, Carter encouraged Conrad to end his life. As Conrad hesitated in his plans to kill himself, Carter
sent this sms: "You keep pushing it off and say you'll do it but u never
do. It's always gonna be that way if u don't take action." The sms was sent on the day he died. The court heard that Carter told Conrad over the phone on
that fateful day to get back into his truck that was filled with poisonous air. The judge said Carter had a duty to call the cops or
Roy's family, but instead listened on the phone as he died. She was sentenced to 15 months in jail for involuntary
manslaughter in 2017, but appealed the conviction. On Monday, the Supreme Judicial Court Justice Scott
Kafker upheld the sentence. He said in his judgement: "After she convinced him
to get back into the carbon monoxide filled truck, she did absolutely nothing
to help him. "She did not call for help or tell him to get out of
the truck as she listened to him choke and die." District Attorney Thomas Quinn said last week: "This
case is a tragedy for all of the people impacted by this case. "However, as the court found in two separate
decisions, her conduct was wanton and reckless, and caused the death of Conrad
Roy." Conrad’s aunt, Becky Maki said after the judgement:
"We hope that no one else ever has to feel this pain. His life
mattered." Carter’s lawyer has said he will further appeal the judgement.
