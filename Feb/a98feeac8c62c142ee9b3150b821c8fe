THE situation between the IFP and ANC is tense following the shooting and assault of ANC supporters on Friday. Two IFP councillors and a local leader in Vryheid, northern Kwa-Zulu-Natal, handed themselves over to the police on Saturday. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the men were arrested in connection with attempted murder, public violence and assault. He said the trouble started when two groups started marching on Friday. Before either of the marches started, one person was shot and wounded and two were assaulted. Zwane said three suspects aged between 40 and 48 were arrested and a firearm was confiscated. ANC regional spokesman Bheki Mkhonza said party members and residents were marching for service delivery when they were attacked by IFP members, including two councillors. Mkhonza said one of the injured marchers was a pregnant woman. Another had to be airlifted to Grey’s Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. “We are still shocked by this attack on innocent and unarmed people. People have a constitutional right to march and the actions of IFP members is taking us back to the dark days of apartheid,” he said. A resident of Bhekzulu kasi said they marched to Abaqulusi Municipality last month and had returned to get a response to their memorandum. IFP mayor Jerry Sibiya confirmed that members and leaders of his party were arrested. He said he didn’t have all the details but would get them when the men appeared in court today.
