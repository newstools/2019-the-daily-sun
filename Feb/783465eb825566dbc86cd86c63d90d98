THESE single mums are proud of themselves. Lindiwe Mbatha (51) and Jabulisiwe Buthelezi (42) from Dundee, northern KZN, make and sell clay pots and beads to feed their kids. Lindiwe told Daily Sun she started doing clay pottery in 1989. “I was taught by my friend, who has since moved overseas. “The money I make helps me to provide for my kids,” Lindiwe said. She said she sold pottery to local people until 2007 when she took her work to Thalane Museum in Dundee. Jabulisiwe makes traditional beads. She said she learnt beadwork from a local group in 1999. “I joined the group because I couldn’t find work. “ I’m happy because it was the best decision I ever made. Today the beads help me feed my children,” said Jabulisiwe. “I’m proud of myself because I was able to send my daughter to college with the money I make.” She also sells from the museum. “The museum gave us stations to do our work and to show it off,” she said.
