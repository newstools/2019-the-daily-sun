LIMPOPO cops have arrested five boys in connection with the brutal killing of 27-years-old Thoriso Themane. The arrested suspects are reportedly grade nine and ten learners. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said on Saturday an unknown number of young people allegedly assaulted the 27-year-old man at Flora Park in Polokwane. The man was taken to hospital for medical treatment but he later succumbed to his injuries. He said a 72-Hour activation plan in order to bring the suspects to justice. Naidoo said the team worked around the clock and arrested five suspects yesterday afternoon. General Khehla Sithole said this kind of response is a message to those who exercise lawlessness  will be arrested and made to face the full brunt of the law. “To compound the ruthlessness of the attack on the man, not only are the suspects involved between the ages of 15 and 16 years old, but the incident was also filmed and posted on social media,” he said. The social media post also illustrated one of the young suspect's claiming to be a son of a senior policeman and that the cops could do nothing about what he had done. The same suspect is now among those behind bars and he is a son of a retired SAPS warrant officer. “His arrest is clearly indicative that nobody can claim to be above the law, and expect to get away with heinous deeds," Naidoo said.
