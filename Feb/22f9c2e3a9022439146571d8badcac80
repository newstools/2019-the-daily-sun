Fatherhood is in the limelight. Since the passing of the Labour Laws Amendment Bill, a historic parliamentary vote in November 2017, the irreplaceable role of fathers and father-figures is being recognised. Created by Sonke Gender Justice (Sonke) and the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) along with numerous organisations, the State of South Africa’s Fathers 2018 offers a big picture view of what fatherhood looks like in South Africa today, and is the first of its kind. The detailed account places a strong emphasis on the many expressions of fatherhood, as not only biological but also social and self-assigned, calling for society to shift its view of fatherhood as a role encompassing both the breadwinner and caregiver. This academic examination of fatherhood highlights the positive ways men are embracing their roles as fathers, and the positive effects a father has on mothers, children and even themselves. The report makes it clear that due to the societal view of mothers as the sole caregiver, past conversations on parenting have excluded men and identifies key areas in most need of development and further study. Here are 12 significant findings uncovered about fatherhood in SA.  Image supplied by Sonke Gender Justice/Photographer Sarah Isaacs "There is no typical father in South Africa. There are many types of fathers and many types of fatherhood in the country." From absent fathers and co-resident fathers to non-resident fathers and social fathers, the report details the many faces of fatherhood in the country. The definitions offered for each include: The report recognises the far-reaching impact of the nation’s violent political past on the role of fatherhood today, linking poor parenting and absence to “the socio-economic legacy of apartheid and, over a longer period of time, slavery and colonialism…” The prevalence of economic scarcity and lack of supportive social networks found among non-white South Africans are identified as key reasons for absent fathers.

Following on from the South African Institute of Race Relations report, growing up without a father makes children “more likely to experience emotional disturbances and depression”, and boys in particular are more likely to display aggressive behaviour. On the other end, girls who grow up with a father will display “higher self-esteem, lower levels of risky sexual behaviour, and fewer difficulties in forming and maintaining romantic relationships later in life. They have less likelihood of having an early pregnancy, bearing children outside marriage, marrying early, or getting divorced.” Despite a mostly positive result, the report warns against assuming that a physically present father is always a good thing since an absent father is considered better than a present but violent one. “The fantasy of the loving nuclear family... is something South Africa needs to be disabused of. It is possible that life in nuclear families with a father present can be as uncaring and violent, or as loving and supportive, as in other forms of family.” The study shows that several factors determine whether a man can be involved in his child’s life, but poverty is singled out as the main reason men aren’t ‘allowed’ to take on the role. Apart from poverty, other factors mentioned were: The document shows that in addition to a lack of resources, for young fathers in particular, societal judgement also keeps them away. “The family of the young mother will often not support the involvement in their family of a young man whom they may perceive as being ‘irresponsible’… even where the young man himself would like to act as a father… he may have little ability – financial, social or legal – to press for access to his child.” The report takes great care in acknowledging the difference between absent fathers, non-resident fathers and fathers who are physically present yet emotionally uninvolved. Despite physical separation, a large percentage of non-resident fathers remain fully invested in their child’s lives through financial and emotional support, as well as providing practical care. The report flags that, contrary to popular views, a father who lives with the family (co-resident fathers) is no guarantee of a warm and loving support system and may be even more distance emotionally, providing little to no care to their children. Referencing a study conducted in Gauteng involving 10 non-resident fathers, when asked about their status, the men shared that it was “undesirable and emotionally distressing”. One man specifically said: “It pains me every time I think of him. Some of us are absent. Not by choice. Whether you are present or you are absent, the fact remains you are a father.”  Image supplied by Sonke Gender Justice/Photographer Sarah Isaacs        Image supplied by Sonke Gender Justice/Photographer Sarah Isaacs  This apparent lack of caregiving by fathers, however, could be explained by another study.  According to the report, contributions by men are not always recognised as care and are dismissed by both themselves and their partners as something that is only done now and then.  It concludes that due to social conventions, men are less likely to receive acknowledgement for the same tasks as mothers.  "The prevailing social norms did not anticipate men engaging in activities such as caring for children, domestic chores or emotional support… although men were clearly observed performing these roles, both men and women tended to either neglect reporting these observations or to dismiss them as aberrant.”  The report warns against this tendency as “such involvement contributes positively toward shaping discourses of men as fathers.”   No other phase in a child’s life is counted as more vital than the first 1 000 days.  Described as the period from conception to pregnancy, and up to a child’s second birthday, the first 1 000 days marks a vulnerable time for a baby’s brain development and a key time for a father’s involvement.  Here positive loving interactions by both parents couldn’t be more crucial for a baby but also goes a long way in assisting a mother as well, particularly with postnatal depression and breastfeeding. Whereas maintenance merely enables financial support, the report suggests looking to the cultural process known as Inhlawulo as a prescribed path to paternal involvement.  Similar to lobola, a man makes a payment in either money or cattle to a woman or young girl’s family for illegitimately fathering a child.  “Inhlawulo is essentially about acknowledging paternity as much as granting permission to a man to be involved in his child’s life... These arrangements and practices clearly show that not only biological parents but families too were involved in raising children."  Despite the potential barrier this poses to men who are not financially stable, the practice encourages involvement in a way that maintenance does not.  Despite being gender-neutral, the report found that “over the past 20 years on average only 2% of the total number of CSG recipients were men” and in these cases all funds were used to cover household and child-related expenses.

Some surveys and reports provide a useful picture in including some characteristics of fathers. However, most lack data on fathers.”  Never before has this much academic research gone into understanding fatherhood in South Africa and the report acknowledges that more needs to be done.  “The State of South Africa’s Fathers report has been developed as an advocacy tool to influence policy and law reform and monitor implementation of current policies and laws related to fatherhood; and as a catalyst to influence... the language currently used in talking about fatherhood.”  Follow this link to download the full report.  https://www.parent24.com/Family/Parenting/fathers-make-society-better-and-12-other-facts-from-the-first-state-of-sas-fathers-report-20180720
