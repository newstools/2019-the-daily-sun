LAZY hands create poverty, but busy hands make it vanish. Luzuko Lupho (34), from Hohoni Village in Peddie, in the Eastern Cape, and his two nephews use donkeys to put food on the table. Unemployed Luzuko never lost hope when he didn’t get a job. Luzuko said: “After I passed grade 12, I couldn’t continue with my studies because my parents were poor. “But my father was able to put food on the table for us using his donkeys. “I then decided to take over his donkey business so I could feed our family.” He said the donkeys have changed his family’s living conditions. “We help the community collect wood and water drums. I charge R300 per load,” said Luzuko. “Social grant money is not enough for my family, gogo and two nephews, but I make enough. “I’m also able to buy mealies and medicine for my donkeys to keep them healthy.” Luzuko’s nephew Sihle Lupho (8) said: “We like the donkeys, but we do our homework because school comes first.” He said he was six when he asked to help his uncle out. Sihle, who hopes to become a lawyer one day, said the donkeys keep them out of trouble. “ I even gave the donkeys names. They are Gabisile, Teaspoon, Khaladi and Slender,” he said. “We thank our uncle who looks after us by giving us a better education with the money he makes.”
