IT SEEMS prophet Shepherd Bushiri’s troubles are far from
over. Just recently, the self-proclaimed prophet spent five
days in jail over fraud and money laundering charges. Now the Home Affairs Department told Daily Sun that they have
started investigations into Prophet Bushiri’s residency in Mzansi. Department of Home Affairs spokesperson Siya Qoza told
Daily Sun that the investigation into his residency is a routine exercise to assist
in the ongoing investigations. “Yes, we are investigating. We want to ascertain
compliance with the Immigration Act and our actions support the work of law
enforcement agencies,” said Qoza Bushiri and his wife Mary are both on R 100 000 bail
each.
