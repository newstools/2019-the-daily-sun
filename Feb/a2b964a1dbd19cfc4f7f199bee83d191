THEIR mother died in July, but the family claim she visits them at night. The family from extension 60 in Olievenhouthbosch, Tshwane said their mother Busisiwe Skhosana (49) was brutally murdered in her shack and her body mutilated. “They killed her like an animal,” her sister Nomusa Dlomo (53) told Daily Sun. She said they can’t sleep because her sister comes to them every night. “Her little children didn’t deserve to lose their mother like that,” she said. Nomusa said her sister was raped and her private parts cut off. “One ear was missing and her fingertips were cut off.” Nomusa said Busisiwe visits them and speaks to her at night. “She comes riding on a brown horse. She gives me money and tells me to take care of the children,” she said. “When I wake up I am happy that I can provide for the children, but then I find there is no money.” Nomusa said a sangoma told her the culprits will be arrested. She said the death of her sister has caused great hardship for the family. “The children are suffering. They need their grant money to survive.” She said she doesn’t understand why their grants were stopped. The sangoma said usually the killers take people’s ears, fingers and punani parts to make themselves strong and to make money. Gauteng Social Development spokesman Thebe Mohatle said the matter will be referred to Sassa.
