NUMSA has condemned government’s decision to unbundle Eskom. The union said as soon as President Cyril Ramaphosa took power, they knew he was a capitalist, which was why they rejected him. Speaking at a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday, union leaders said the crisis was self inflicted. They said the main causes were independent power producers, inflated coal costs, too many executives. and cost overruns at the Medupi and Kusile power stations. The union claimed the Eskom board, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and Energy Minister Jeff Radebe did not respond to these problems. General secretary Irvin Jim said unbundling Eskom would not solve its crisis. He claimed the ANC and DA were working together to destroy Eskom through the Independent System Market Operator Bill. He said Numsa demanded honesty and a turnaround strategy. “As part of the way forward, we should not be misled as we fully understand the urgent and critical nature of the challenge facing Eskom, which has debt of around R419 billion. Eskom can be fixed and its liquidity can be sorted out,” he said.
