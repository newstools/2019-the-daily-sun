The African National Congress is alarmed at the baseless
allegations Terror Lekota levelled against President Cyril Ramaphosa. “We reject these insinuations with the contempt they
deserve.  The ANC has full confidence in
President Ramaphosa, and we do not take kindly to desperate attempts to call to
question his integrity.  Allegations of
this nature are often made when the accuser fears exposure for his own misdeeds
or runs out of political ideas,” said  Zizi
Kodwa, Acting National Spokesperson. Kodwa said the 54th national conference elected President
Ramaphosa as the ANC President, having earned his stripes as a leader of our
glorious movement. A product of the
South Africa Students’ Organisation, he rose through the ranks of the mass
democratic movement to become the General-Secretary of the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM). “ President Ramaphosa became the first Secretary-General
of the ANC following its unbanning in 1990, and lead the ANC’s negotiations
team that led to the 1994 breakthrough and adoption of the final Constitution
in 1996. “Our people have full confidence in President Ramaphosa
and we are confident that notwithstanding the challenges of the recent past,
the ANC will emerge victorious at the polls with President Ramaphosa as the
face of its campaign. “Notwithstanding the baseless allegations made by Terror
Lekota, the ANC will not be deterred in galvanising the nation to embrace a
future where every citizen has a stake in growing South Africa into a vibrant
and prosperous nation. “The ANC and it Alliance partners are inspired by
President Ramaphosa’s leadership.  Those
who have nothing to offer to the people of South Africa will always find a way
to throw stones and make attempts at denigrating his strong character.”
