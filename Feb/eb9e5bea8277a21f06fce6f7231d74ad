Three men were injured one of them critically, when a truck
rear-ended another on the N3 highway near the Mariannhill toll plaza in,
KwaZulu Natal on Thursday. One of the trucks crashed against the ARMCO barrier while a
second truck had come to a stop some distance away, on the side of the road. “Scrap metal from the one truck had been spread across the
highway in the collision,” ER24’s Russel Meiring said. He said on closer inspection, paramedics found two men
walking around on the scene while a third man was found lying trapped inside
the one truck in a critical condition. “Rescue services had to use specialised equipment to free
the trapped patient from the truck.” Meiring said following that the man was freed and provided
with advanced life support interventions before he was transported to a nearby
hospital. “The two remaining men were treated for their moderate
injuries and were thereafter transported to a nearby hospital.” He said.
