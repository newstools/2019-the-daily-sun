ETHEKWINI ANC councillor Mthokozisi Nojiyeza wants the court to review its decision to deny him bail. Nojiyeza is accused of killing ANC councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo. The matter was supposed to be heard in the Umlazi Magistrates Court yesterday but was postponed to 20 February. Prosecutor Thiyani Mabaso asked for a postponement. He and investigating officer Bonginkosi Dlamini had not prepared for the case as they only came to know of the matter yesterday. Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa for Nojiyeza said he had obtained new facts that would force the state to release his client. Maphumulo’s sister Phumzile (34) said the family heard the suspects wanted to appeal, yet the investigating officer had said he was not aware of this. Mlotshwa said the state witnesses were forced to implicate Nojiyeza. Another accused, Phumlani Nojiyeza, is also applying for a review of the decision to deny him bail. His lawyer Siphamandla Ngcobo said his client would also rely on the state witnesses’ new testimony. Last week Daily Sun reported that two state witnesses, Sandile Mvelase (42) and Nkosingiphile Nojiyeza (34), had said they implicated the councillor as they were tortured by cops.
