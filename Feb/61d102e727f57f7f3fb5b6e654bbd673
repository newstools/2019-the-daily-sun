PETER Mokgoko is a happy man. The 74-year-old from Soshanguve, north of Tshwane found his missing wife, Johanna (59). Johanna went missing in December last year when Peter took her to her monthly check-up at Dr George Mukhari Hospital. Daily Sun published their story: “Worried sick about Johanna.” At the time, Peter was worried about where his mentally ill wife was. He said Johanna was diagnosed with dementia some years ago. But Peter was relieved when they recently found Johanna at a mental institution. His daughter Lydia said they never stopped looking for her. “I went to look for her at a mental institution and her photo was posted at admissions, so they checked for us in the system,” said Lydia. She said they were told Johanna wasn’t in the system. “I insisted on seeing the social worker. Luckily she referred me to a woman who helped me by contacting all the female wards and gave them a description of the patient,” she said.
