RELATIVES are still not sure what killed Mximbi Khotha (50). Phindile (43) said his brother fell off a stretcher as he was being carried into Nic Bodenstein Hospital in Wolmaransstad, North West. He said Mximbi would still be alive if he had not fallen off the stretcher. Jackson (48), Mximbi’s other brother, said the family should be compensated if the paramedics’ negligence was the cause of death. Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said Mximbi was transferred from Nic Bodenstein to Tshepong Hospital after being diagnosed with a hypertensive stroke and suspected base of skull fracture. “An investigation revealed that part of his heart was enlarged. A scan showed no evidence of brain injury or fracturing of the skull. Our investigations do not support the idea that the fall was the cause of death.”
