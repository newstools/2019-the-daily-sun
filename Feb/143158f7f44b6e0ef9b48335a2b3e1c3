KERMIT Erasmus has recovered his form in time for what looks like a very hectic schedule for Cape Town City FC head coach, Benni McCarthy. Things are not getting any easier for McCarthy’s side. They have the toughest three Absa Premiership back-to-back matches, which they have to win to enhance their chances of a top five finish. They have Maritzburg United on Saturday, followed by Mamelodi Sundowns on 27 February and then Bidvest Wits on 2 March. The Capetonians secured a Nedbank Cup quarter-final spot with a 3-0 victory against Highlands Park on Friday, in a match that saw Erasmus, formerly with Portuguese side Primeira Liga side Vitória de Setúbal, play a key role. “It is not easy,” said McCarthy. “I’m going to need every quality player I have at my disposal. Now I’m forced to try and juggle players around. ‘It’s not getting easier for me, with games coming up at this pace.” McCarthy says he always knew that Erasmus will require time to settle and reclaim the form he enjoyed before he left the country in 2016 to join Rennes, a French Ligue 1. In his first 90 minutes for City, Erasmus, formerly with Orlando Pirates, contributed to their victory when he took Highlands Park goalkeeper, Marlon Huegh, to a different side before laying the ball to Thamsanqa Mkhize, who easily shot home. This is the performance that earned Erasmus the man of the match prize. The other players who steered The Citizens to the last 8 of the Ke Yona cup are Craig Martin and an own-goal from Heugh. “Kermy has to be nurtured more. He hasn’t played for a long time. So for us to expect him to just fly in and do miracles would be unfair,” added McCarthy.
