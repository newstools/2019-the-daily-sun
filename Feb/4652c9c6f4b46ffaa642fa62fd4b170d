South Africa’s most recognizable personalities have joined in the nation’s call for #JusticeforThoriso. This as the brutal murder of 27-year-old Thoriso Themane by five school pupils in Polokwane and has shaken South Africans. A viral video of the murder has sent shock waves around Mzansi and calls for the young suspects to be brought to book are increasing by the hour. The video, which depicts the murder by the unseen suspects, has gone viral and #JusticeForThoriso has remained at the top of the trends list since the video leaked earlier this week. It is understood that all five suspects are in police custody despite one of them claiming that nothing would happen to him due to his father’s high ranking status in the police force. The young boy’s video confession, coupled with the murder video has rendered many people furious and calling for SAPS to take immediate action. Local celebs are also using their voices to put pressure on the police for there to be decisive action taken. A petition is also doing the rounds for everyone to add their signature to the call. TV personality, Thembisa Mdoda’s heart broke for Thoriso’s father: “The pain in his voice when he speaks of his son. This entire ordeal is inhumane,” she said. “I have never seen anything like this ever... never cried for someone I don’t know mara lehono kea palelwa (but today I can’t). I don’t know who we are anymore. Something should be done,” said actor, Clement Maosa. Meanwhile, Cassper Nyovest says he knows what it’s like to lose a friend at the hands of someone else and have them get away with it. “Never been a violent dude. Grew up around it. Never been my vibe. One of my friends by the name of Itumeleng Mpedi was killed trying to stop a fight and the killer walked free cause the mom was a cop. It really happens in this country and that boy knows it. #JusticeForThoriso,” he said. “What a scary world we live in,” said Thando Thabethe.
