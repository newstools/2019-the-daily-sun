Four Banyana Banyana stars are hoping to reach major milestones at the Cyprus Women’s Cup. Desiree Ellis’ charges will assemble for camp on Wednesday as they prepare for the tournament which will take place from 27 February to 6 March. They are in Group A alongside Finland, Korea DPR and the Czech Republic. The tournament will be Ellis’ final opportunity to fine tune her charges before she picks the squad to do battle at the World Cup in France. Banyana will be making their debut at the world showpiece event set to be staged in France from 7 June to 7 July this year. Noko Matlou, Nompumelelo Nyandeni, Refilwe Jane and Thembi Kgatlana will all be hoping to have reached their personal milestones come the World Cup. Defender Matlou, who made her debut for Banyana back in 2002, is just one match shy of reaching 150 caps. She is the second highest capped player in the team after Captain Janine Van Wyk, who has amassed an impressive 161 caps. Matlou was the first South African player to win the CAF Women’s player of the year award, before Kgatlana followed in her footsteps. Midfielder Nyandeni is three games shy of reaching the same figure, she made her debut for Banyana in 2007. Meanwhile, Vice-captain Jane is eying the magical 100 figure in terms of appearances. The Canberra United star who has scored 16 goals for Banyana, is just a game away from the milestone and joining an elite group of players. Kgatlana, the reigning CAF Women’s player of the year, is some way behind that mark, but is chasing her own milestone as well. The speedy forward is sitting on 47 caps and could reach the 50 mark by the time they head out to rub shoulders with the World’s best in France.
