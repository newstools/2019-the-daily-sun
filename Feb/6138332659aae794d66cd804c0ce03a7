YESTERDAY, Free State Agriculture and Rural Development welcomed 13 veterinarians to its new compulsory community service programme. They will help improve veterinary services in the province, providing disease control, veterinary public health and diagnostic services. Agriculture MEC Benny Malakoane told them: “This programme offers the chance to offer much needed services to rural areas and gain experience and knowledge.” He said the department saw the need for primary animal healthcare in rural communities. Vet Shannon Kruger (24) told Daily Sun most of her work centred on educating residents on how to care for their animals. “People have sheep but don’t shear them because of a lack of knowledge. We hope the information we give them will enable them to look after their animals better,” she said.
