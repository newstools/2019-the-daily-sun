MORE THAN a year ago cops responded to call to be told a man had been murdered by the community. A mum had allegedly heard her daughter fighting with her boyfriend in another room. According to records, she found her daughter Maditaba Modise (23) had been stabbed and her boyfriend Buti Lereka (31), was running out of the house. The community was alerted and stabbed Buti to death! But now, Maditaba, who was stabbed in the stomach, has vanished without a trace. Thabong cops are looking for her in connection with Buti’s murder case. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said: “Police in Thabong, near Welkom in the Free State, have information that Matiba might be in Hoopstad. “When the police went to check on Maditaba at the local hospital, she had been discharged. The investigating officers went to her shack but she had moved.” Mokhuoane said Buti was certified dead on the scene and a case of murder was opened. The police appealed to anyone with information to contact Detective-Sergeant Gerrie Nel on 082 806 8432.
