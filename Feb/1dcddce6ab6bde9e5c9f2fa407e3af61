Londiwe, who was part of the Sarafina 3 cast that toured Nigeria, urged women to take action. “Women are killed because they sometimes stay in abusive relationships,” said Londiwe. “They’re ignorant and blinded by love.

What he did is unacceptable.” Seven Days War director Mvuselelo Buthelezi said: “We hope the law sets an example to men that abuse has no place here.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A suspect aged 30 years was arrested and appeared in court.”
