A MEMORIAL service for the seven people who died in a car crash last weekend was held in Matsula outside Mbombela, Mpumalanga, yesterday. Their taxi collided with a truck between Thekwane and KaNyamazane. Ethan Ntimane (63), whose son-in-law Jacob Phume (42) was only identified on Wednesday at the Themba Hospital mortuary, was on his way to town to deposit money for his parents when he died. “We blame government for Jacob’s death because if we had services like banks in the area, he would still be alive,” said Ethan. The service was attended by Safety MEC Pat Ngomane, Finance MEC Eric Kholwane and Mbombela mayor Sibusiso Mathonsi. The victims will be buried separately at the weekend.
