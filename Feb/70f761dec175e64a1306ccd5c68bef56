FORMER Sadtu bosses Thobile Ntola and Mbuyiseni Mathonsi have vowed to end the union’s dominance. They have founded their own union, the South African Liberated Public Sector Workers Union. Ntola was Sadtu president while Mathonsi was its KZN secretary. Ntola said: “We’ve formed a union that’s independent. Our only interest is to focus on members, not their political affiliation. “Teachers and other government employees have been crying to us to form a non-political union that will serve their interests. So we have responded to that call.” Mathonsi said their union was not only for teachers. While at Sadtu, they realised there was a need for workers in government to speak with one voice. Mathonsi is national secretary responsible for education, while Ntola is union national secretary. Mathonsi said the union already had 60 000 members. Ntola apparently fell out with Sadtu after he associated himself with former Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi. Sadtu national secretary Mugwena Maluleke said they were not worried about populists and opportunists.
