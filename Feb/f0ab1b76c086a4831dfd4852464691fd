FUMING residents of Phola, near Ogies in Mpumalanga, marched to the new police station on Monday. They complained that the station was too small for such a huge community and said it lacked resources. Speaking to Daily Sun, leader Lucas Mtsweni of the Waya Waya movement, said: “We feel undermined as community members because our station doesn’t have detectives offices, storerooms, victim support centre and vehicles.” The residents submitted their memorandum to Lieutenant-Colonel Nape Matlala and gave him seven working days to respond. Constable Thabang Ntuli said residents will get a response on 26 February.
