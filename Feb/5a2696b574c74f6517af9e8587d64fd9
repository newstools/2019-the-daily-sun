House music producer and DJ, businesswoman and all-round star, DJ Zinhle says she is unbothered and unphased by all the smack being spoken about her. The My Name Is hit-maker has been in the entertainment biz for a very long time now so she has become an expert at tuning out the noise. Even when it is her private life that is splattered all over the internet. Rumours of a rekindled love affair between her and baby daddy, AKA have been doing the rounds for over two months now. These rumours are fueled by Zinhle appearing in AKA’s videos, her recent birthday message to him, her bestie Pearl Thusi being the Roast Master of the Comedy Central Roast of AKA and the fact that the former lovebirds have been spotted out together on numerous occasions of late including an alleged baecation. But no matter what is or isn’t said, DJ Zinhle couldn’t care less. "I'm really not concerned about public opinions. I feel like I am in an industry where my work and his (AKA's) work speak for themselves. But it is really how much you let people into your personal space and how you let it affect you. I have learnt to really not let it affect me,” she told TshisaLive in a recent interview. "I was at my cousin's funeral over the weekend and it got me thinking about what is important in life. In the face of death, does the things we worry about really matter? I am now in a space where I am selective of what really bothers me,” she continued.
