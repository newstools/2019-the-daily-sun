GROWING up, Selemeng Mphakakasi’s dream was to become a lawyer but God had other plans for her. Today, the 34-year-old is a fashion designer and runs her own business. She said she first started sewing to help her mum, who worked as a tailor from their home in Rocklands, Mangaung. “I used to alter my clothes to suit my style. My passion for designing grew and I asked my mum to teach me to sew. I wanted to be a lawyer but God chose fashion for me. “I went to study design at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology in Lesotho and I graduated in 2012,” she said. Last year, I got office space, machines, mentorship and training in marketing at Motheo Incubation Centre. “The centre has helped me a lot to learn more about business and marketing. I have more clients now than when I was working from home,” she said.
