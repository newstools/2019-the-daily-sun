FOUR friends were craving juicy mangoes and decided to pick some in the bushes. But the trip turned to disaster – only three of them returned home safely. Thabiso Zondi from Matimatolo, KZN Midlands, was found dead on Monday! His madala Elphias (60) said Thabiso’s friend had told him all four of them went together to fetch mangoes on Sunday. When they returned, they took different routes. He and Thabiso (13) took one route while the other two took another. “He said as they were walking, the friend told him they should check on the two friends who had gone the other direction. Thabiso refused and said he was going home because it was getting late.” Elphias said the friend had told him he left Thabiso and went to look for the other two alone. “Later that afternoon I noticed he wasn’t home and asked Thabiso’s mum to go look for him. “She went to the friend’s house and was told he had left him in the mountains. We waited for him to come home, but he didn’t. “On Monday cops came and we searched for him near the mountain where the friend had left him. “We then found his body at the foot of the mountain.” Thabiso had injuries on his body. “He was hit by stones when he rolled down the mountain. “Thabiso was the third person to fall down that mountain and die. “I don’t understand why they took that route because everyone knows it’s dangerous.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was being investigated.
