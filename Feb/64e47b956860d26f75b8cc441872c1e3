Success-starved Kaizer Chiefs were finally paired with top-flight opponents in the 2019 Nedbank Cup when the last-eight draw was made Thursday in Johannesburg. After twice needing extra-time to get past third-tier rivals Tornado and The Magic, the record 13-time winners of the competition were drawn at home to Cape Town City. Chiefs, the most successful South African club with 53 domestic titles, have not won a competition since being crowned 2015 Absa Premiership champions. The clubs met in the league last month with a blunder by since-axed Namibian goalkeeper Virgil Vries gifting Cape Town a 1-0 victory at FNB Stadium in Soweto. Chiefs bought Nigeria World Cup squad goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi from strugglers Chippa United to replace Vries, but he is cup-tied so Bruce Bvuma is set to face City. Like all top-flight clubs, Chiefs boast a multi-national squad with captain Willard Katsande and fellow Zimbabwe international Khama Billiat key figures. Cape Town received a huge blow this month when an injury ruled Austrian midfielder Roland Putsche out for the rest of the season. Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela takes his team to Bloemfontein Celtic, who he quit two months ago after they reneged on parts of his contract, including paying a DSTV subscription. There will be a non-Absa Premiership semi-finalist as the two second division survivors, Cape Umoya United (formerly Platinum Stars) and TS Galaxy were drawn together.
