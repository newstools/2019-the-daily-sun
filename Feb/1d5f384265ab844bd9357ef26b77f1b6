KZN gogos were disappointed about their grant increases. During the budget speech on Wednesday, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni announced the old age grant would increase by R85 from R1 695 to R1 780. Before his speech, members of the Pietermaritzburg Pensioners Forum picketed outside the KZN Legislature, calling for a reasonable increase. The forum was formed last year to call for better increase of grants, including a 13th cheque for pensioners. Founding member Hilda Mbasa (72) from Haniville said the increase wasn’t enough to meet their needs. “I have five grandchildren who need to be clothed and go to school. “This money is not even equal to the scholar transport operators increase. “We were hoping for better news because things are tough on us gogos.” Gogo Nora Ngubane (65) from Snathing near Edendale said looking after eight grandkids was tough. “Demands for uniforms, stationery and textbooks have meant I had to borrow money. “When we receive our old age grant, the first thing we pay are creditors and funeral cover, and by then there is very little to buy groceries. “It’s difficult to accept a R85 increase because it won’t do much.” Gogo Doreen Taylor (65) said life was difficult for gogos as they worked as domestic workers during apartheid and had hoped for a better life under democracy. She said they were forced to look after their grandchildren as most of their parents were unemployed. Last year, forum members organised a national online petition for government to pay them a 13th cheque. They said their suffering was shared by many across Mzansi.
