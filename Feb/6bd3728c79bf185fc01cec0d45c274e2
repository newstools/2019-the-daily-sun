HLAUDI Motsoeneng believes his party will soon rise to power. He was speaking at his election campaign in Boitekong, near Rustenburg in North West, on Sunday. The former SABC chief operating officer is the president of the African Content Movement. Motsoeneng said President Cyril Ramaphosa does not know how to turn the country around. “Everything the ANC does is to please big business and the West,” he said. “I’m Hlaudi, Mr 90%. I want all mines to be 90% owned by black people.” He said members of his party are not politicians. “We’re servants. There are no politicians in the Bible,” Motsoeneng told a group of supporters.
