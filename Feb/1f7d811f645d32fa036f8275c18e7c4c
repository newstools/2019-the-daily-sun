  The IFP in Gauteng says it is disappointed that Gauteng
Premier David Makhura turned the 2019 State of the Province (SOPA) into an
electioneering exercise. It says therefore
they failed to tell the people of Gauteng the real state of affairs in their
province. IFP Provincial Chairperson and member of Parliament,
Bonginkosi Dlamini told Daily Sun
that the achievements that the Premier talked about in his attempt to paint a
good picture of Gauteng are contradicted by what is happening on the ground. “People are angry and disgruntled hence protests are a daily
occurrence,” he said. He said regarding the issue of hostels, they are not
surprised by the Premier’s admission that his administration has failed to
upgrade and transform hostels into family units during this term. “The ANC-led government has shown without fail in the past
25 years that hostel residents do not count for much,” he said. Dlamini said that it is high time for the people of Gauteng
in townships and informal settlements to put a political party which they can
trust into power. “A political party which will talk on their behalf without
shame or reservation for they like any other Gauteng citizen deserves to be
treated with dignity rather than the arrogance depicted by the ANC-led government,”
he said
