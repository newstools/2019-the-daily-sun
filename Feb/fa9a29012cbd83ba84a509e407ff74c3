A VEHICLE belonging to the University of KZN was torched yesterday in Westville, Durban, during a student protest. Daily Sun has learnt that other tertiary institutions around KZN are also protesting. The SRC’s Wiseman Mdakane said students were unhappy with NSFAS and about limited resources from the university. He said returning students were affected by the NSFAS issue and couldn’t register. “They aren’t financially cleared. The university wants them to pay outstanding fees upfront.” He said students should be allowed to register if they met the minimum requirements. University spokeswoman Normah Zondo said: “The academic programme is suspended at campuses after a memorandum was received from the SRC. “This will give management time to address matters with student leadership, while ensuring the safety of all concerned.” Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “They set a vehicle and guardroom alight. “A police vehicle was damaged. A case was opened. “Police are monitoring the situation.”
