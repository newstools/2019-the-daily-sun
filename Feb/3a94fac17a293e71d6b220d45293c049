WHEN cops demanded to search him, Mokete Mokoka asked why they had picked on him. Little did he know how he would pay for it. The 40-year-old claims after the five cops searched him and found nothing, they moered him for no reason. The incident happened at Lebowakgomo Complex in Limpopo on Thursday. When Mokete went to open a case against the cops, he found the same officers at the station. “When they saw me at the charge office, they dragged me to a separate office and assaulted me again,” said Mokete. He said he called his friend, who took him to hospital. He said he was grateful to two cops who came to the hospital and helped him open a case. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the matter was sent to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate for a ruling.
