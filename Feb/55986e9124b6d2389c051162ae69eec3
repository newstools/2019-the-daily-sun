A DRIVER (39) and a woman (23) are fighting for their lives in hospital after the bakkie they were travelling in overturned. The accident happened on Tuesday on the D401 road between New Forest and Arthurstone, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. A witness said the white Isuzu bakkie was speeding down the road when the driver lost control and hit two telephone cement poles. “We heard a loud bang as the speeding bakkie hit the poles. “It rolled several times before the two people flew through the window.” Nonkululeko Nxumalo, a community liaison officer at Doc’s Construction, confirmed that the bakkie belonged to their company. “I was at a site camp for this road construction when I received a call from the police,” said Nxumalo. “We couldn’t believe the bakkie which had just left the camp was involved in a crash. “The driver was attending to one of our construction sites at New Forest outside Thulamahashe. But the woman is unknown.” Police spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane confirmed that a case of reckless driving has been opened.
