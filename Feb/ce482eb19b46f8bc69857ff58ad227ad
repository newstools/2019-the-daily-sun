Reason has become the latest victim in a slew of stars whose social media accounts and/or cellphone numbers have been hacked by cyber thugs. At this point, we’re going to need a commission of inquiry into all of these hacks. In the first two months of 2019 alone stars such as Somizi, Cassper Nyovest, Priddy Ugly, and Caster Semenya have been targeted by these cyber thugs. Just last week, Cassper had to buy his own Twitter account back from the thugs who stole it since he desperately needed to get back onto his account to announce his Samsung ambassadorship.

If u get strange requests from me... ask for a picture or a photo. If my tweets start doing funny things... just be aware. Trying to recover it as we speak,” he warned his fans, friends and family. Never one to shy away from reprimanding trolls online, Reason told one hater that this was not a funny situation at all. GIGABA VIDEO HACK PROBED! “Let’s try not make light of this thing like that.
