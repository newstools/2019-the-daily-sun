THE Doek On Fleek All-White Picnic tickets are sold out! Organiser Thandi Mavata told Daily Sun that’s because Doek On Fleek celebrated women’s tenacious spirit, love of self and those around them. The picnic will be held at Giant Stadium in Soshanguve, Tshwane, on 30 March. Thandi said the organisation and the events it hosts started in 2016. “The aim of the market was to dismiss the notion that women don’t support each other by encouraging them to buy items from other women and to network and explore other business opportunities in an informal setting.” Thandi said the African doek had a symbolic meaning of knowledge passed down from gogo and mother to daughter. “A flood of women from across South Africa started creating small communities in the name of Doek On Fleek and the movement quickly caught fire,” she said. “In recent months we’ve introduced this movement to Botswana, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.” Doek On Fleek is a 100% black female-owned organisation that prides itself on employing young women. “We manage and promote the Doek On Fleek lifestyle events including the Doek On Fleek All White Picnic, market days, boat cruise, family and kids picnics, stokvel gathering and the karaoke nights, among other events,” she said.
