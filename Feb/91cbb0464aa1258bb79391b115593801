THE mum of a newborn baby found dumped in a stormwater drain last week has been arrested. The 27-year-old was bust at a hospital on Monday for allegedly leaving her child in the drain in Newlands East, Durban. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the woman would face a charge of attempted murder after she’s released from hospital. A resident said the woman had not been well since she gave birth. She said the woman went to a clinic, and when nurses realised her baby wasn’t with her they called cops. She allegedly dumped her baby in a medical waste bin. She was arrested at King Edward VIII Hospital and charged with attempted murder. Nurses said the woman had told them her boyfriend and father had warned her not to come hosme with another baby as it was her second pregnancy.
