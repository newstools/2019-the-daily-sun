 The African National Congress (ANC) says the organization has
accepted Pule Mabe and Zizi Kodwa’s requests to step down as spokespersons. According to Secretary-General Ace Magashule, Dakota Legoete
will continue acting as the national spokesperson on the ANC. “The NWC noted serious allegations of impropriety which have
been levelled against Cde Pule Mabe and Cde Zizi Kodwa.  The ANC has therefore accepted their request
to voluntarily step aside while dealing with the matters.” “ Cde Pule and Cde Zizi have voluntarily elected to stand
down as Spokespersons until these allegations have been tested, but they will
remain members of the National Executive Committee (NEC),” Magashule said. He said gender-based violence is an endemic problem in our
society which should not be reduced to individual leaders. “The ANC is committed to fighting gender-based violence
wherever it occurs and takes allegations against any person with the
seriousness it deserves,” he said.
