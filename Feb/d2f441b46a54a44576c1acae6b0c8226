RAPPER Kwesta was full of jokes when a video of a man who looks like an older version of him were posted on social media on Friday. In the video, the man claims to be Kwesta’s brother from the villages and says he’s good at playing the guitar. The man says Kwesta, whose real name is Senzo Vilakazi, has a lot of money. A video of Kwesta watching the video surfaced at the weekend. A person can be heard asking him: “Kwesta, when did you get this old?” Kwesta jokes: “That’s my big bro. I need to find him.” He jokes that the only incorrect thing the man said was that he had a lot of money. Social media users urged Kwesta to find the man so he could undergo DNA tests. He said he had never met the man before, and added: “People know what they see.” When asked whether he would meet with the man, he said he would see what happened.Efforts to find and speak to Kwesta’s lookalike were unsuccessful.
