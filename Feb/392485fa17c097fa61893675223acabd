MZANSI is frustrated with the load shedding – and so is the ANC! Yesterday ANC acting spokesman Zizi Kodwa said the load shedding was an attempt to sabotage the new vision for the country. “The coincidence is suspicious. This comes a few days after the president made bold statements during the State of the Nation Address about growing the economy and boosting investment,” he said. Kodwa said government’s intention to unbundle Eskom as announced by Ramaphosa in his address would make Eskom more profitable. “The country has been assured of sufficient electricity. Suddenly, with very short notice, we went to stage 4 on Monday,” said Kodwa. In his address, Ramaphosa said Eskom would be split into generation, transmission and distribution departments that would all fall under Eskom Holdings.
