COPS pounced on the thugs as they helped themselves to snacks. Ten young men attacked a truck loaded with chips in Soshanguve Block P, Tshwane, on Friday. Police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleka said the young men, aged between 15 and 22, allegedly threw stones at the truck and forced the driver to stop. “They helped themselves to boxes of snacks,” he said. But the thugs’ luck ran out when police caught the young men red-handed with the stolen goods. Maluleka said they’ve been receiving complaints from motorists, especially truck drivers, about the crime in Soshanguve Block P. “This kind of crime has been happening since last year. No injuries were reported and no arrests were previously made,” he said. Maluleka said the young men committed the crime at different times of the day. “The honeymoon is over for thieves. “We have a team of seasoned cops who will monitor the area,” he said. “Cops are investigating to determine if the young men are linked to other criminal activities in the area.” He said the suspects will appear in the Soshanguve Magistrates Court today to face robbery charges.
