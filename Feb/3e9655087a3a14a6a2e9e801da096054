MINISTER of Sport and Recreation in South Africa Tokozile Xasa
is in Switzerland to offer support to Caster ‘Mokgadi’ Semenya. Semenya is currently attending the Court of Arbitration for
Sport (CAS) case between the IAAF and Athletics South Africa (ASA) on the proposed
IAAF regulations targeting female athletes with hyperandrogenism. Should the IAAF
decide to go ahead with the proposal, athletes will have to undergo an unnatural
medical process that will reduce their naturally produced testosterone. Meanwhile, the Department of Women said it is appalled at
the IAAF ruling. Minister of Women, Bathabile Dlamini, said the department
has supported Semenya from the outset, constantly engaging the media on the
IAAF’s colonial treatment of the female body. She said that women bear the brunt of discrimination in
society, through institutionalised patriarchy in schools, universities, places
of worship, in the workplace, and in the home. “Sexism also rears its head on the sports field where we are
expected to accept pay disparities for male and female teams and the relegation
of female sporting codes to second-tier events not worthy of coverage on
television. The professionalism of women athletes also continues to be
questioned because this goes against deeply ingrained ideas of the roles of
women in society,” she said.
