QUANTUM Secondary School pupils had to sit on the floor because tavern patrons were using their chairs. Last Wednesday, cops in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, bust a local businessman with the stolen chairs. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said the principal came forward to identify the chairs found stacked up in the tavern ownerâ€™s storeroom. The owner was bust for possession of stolen goods and live ammunition and appeared in the Daveyton Magistrates Court. Several Gauteng schools have been broken into since the start of the term, with Menzi Primary School in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, the hardest hit. Last month, five men tied up two guards and stole 185 tablets, eight laptops, two data projectors, three desktop computers, a TV, petty cash and a digital recorder from the school. After cops launched a manhunt, four suspects were bust and 22 tablets and three laptops were recovered from a shop in Joburg. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi appealed to parents to look after schools and provide information about thefts.
