RESIDENTS were gatvol of thugs terrorising them. So they decided to punish them with public humiliation. When members of Mangaung crime-fighting group Wanya Tsotsi catch crooks, they make them walk the streets naked! Freedom Square kasi resident Tshidiso Salman (32) told Daily Sun: “We are working together as community members to fight crime ekasi. “Crime has decreased since we formed the group. We are tired of thugs and want peace in our areas.” Tshidiso said they patrolled day and night. “When members patrol at night, they wear red T-shirts and have sjamboks. “We use a WhatsApp group to communicate and two-way radios if there is an emergency. “We are dealing with possession of drugs, rape and robbery. If thugs co-operate, we call the police. “Otherwise, we deal with them ourselves.” Tshidiso said the group, which was formed five years ago, worked with local religious leaders and parents and donated uniforms to needy pupils. However, police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the crime fighters didn’t work with the police. “The only structure working with the police is the CPF but the station where the group operates is aware of the situation,” he said. “They were advised to join a recognised structure like the CPF. If they are involved in any activity where the law is broken, we won’t hesitate to make arrests.”
