FORMER Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga has been sworn in as a member of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature in Joburg. Msimanga is not a first time member of the provincial legislature. He left to go run the Tshwane Mayoral position in local elections, which saw the ANC losing the metro to DA led coalition in 2016. During the brief, swearing in ceremony, speaker Ntombi Mekgwe said, “We are welcoming back one of our own.” “I’m sure we are all witness because his (other) name is Tshepiso and he is making a promises, so that promise must not be broken,” she said. Msimanga, left his post as a Mayor of Tshwane to focus on his ambitions of becoming the Gauteng number citizen. He told Daily Sun, “It feels familiar; this is the familiar territory for me. However, he said it will be different because the politics at the local and provincial levels are not the same.
