THIS year Mzansi will be celebrating 25 years of democratic rule. But residents of Machibini, near Ladysmith, do not enjoy the fruits of democracy. They do not have running water and are forced to share a dirty dam with animals. Resident Bhekinkosi Sithole (52) said the dam is about 2km away. “We drink the water, but also use it to cook and bath. “But cows also go there when they are thirsty,” said Bhekinkosi. “The municipality used to deliver water to our village at least once a month. “But the vehicle hasn’t come since July.” Thabani Magudulela (55), another resident, said the community begged the ward councillor to intervene. But he told them that there was nothing he could do because the water delivery vehicle has not been maintained. “He never tells us if we’re going to get taps in our village. “The service delivery in this village is so poor that we are thinking of not casting our votes in the upcoming election,” said Thabani. Councillor Sabelo Madinane said the water services were handled by the district municipality. “I met the district leaders and they told me they do not have any money. “We do not have a water and sanitation budget.” Jabulani Mkhonza, spokesman for the uThukela Municipality, said the water tanker service was scrapped because of financial restrictions. “The water tankers did not belong to the municipality, but were hired. That is why residents have not had a regular water supply,” he said.
