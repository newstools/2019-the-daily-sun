A WOMAN was arrested yesterday for killing and chopping up her nine-month-old baby. According to a neighbour, Sophie Nkuna, the 37-year-old woman from Klipgat, North West, visited her on Tuesday. “She told me she couldn’t sleep at night and she wanted to die because she was struggling,” she said. “She asked me to rescue her from the things attacking her so I suggested we go to church.” Sophie said she called church women to come and pray for the woman. “While they were praying, she screamed like a creature,” she said. Sophie said the next morning she heard she had killed her baby. North West police spokesman Captain Sam Tselanyane said both of the child’s parents were arrested. “The man, who is 34, was found with fraudulent SA IDs and the woman was arrested for murder,” he told Daily Sun.
