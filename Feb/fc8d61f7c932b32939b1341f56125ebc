DEPUTY President David Mabuza said government was doing everything to empower businesses belonging to women and the youth. He said this during a question and answer session in the National Assembly in Cape Town yesterday. “The plight of young people remains foremost in our efforts as a country to radically and economically transform our society.” He said former president Nelson Mandela believed poverty was artificial and could be fought. “We want young people to become Madiba’s anti-poverty generation. “Our job as government is to help them realise their dreams.” Mabuza said they had set aside billions of rands through the Industrial Development Corporation for businesswomen and the youth. He said in 2015 the economic development ministry set aside R4,5 billion to support them. “Today, the Industrial Development Corporation has exceeded that target and it didn’t stop there. “It continues to lend money to young people and women.” ACDP’s Rev Kenneth Moshoe asked Mabuza about unemployment in the country and what government is doing about it. “The problem of unemployment is not government’s problem alone.” Mabuza called on all stakeholders to work with government.
