Significant rainfall over parts of the Garden Route District and Little Karoo has lead to localised flooding on Saturday afternoon causing Meiringspoort to be closed. The pass is between Oudtshoorn and Beaufort West, where residents have been rationed to 10 litres of water a day due to the persisting drought. The closure of the pass is, according to the head of the Garden Route District Municipalityâ€™s Disaster Management Gerhard Otto, due to streams of water flowing down the pass after the torrential rains.  Motorists are advised to use alternative routes.    Residents and road users have reported heavy rains and hail in the area. Heavy rain is also falling over the Garden Route. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/heavy-rains-lead-to-flooding-in-parts-of-bone-dry-karoo-20190202
