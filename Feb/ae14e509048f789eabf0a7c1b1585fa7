Police Minister Bheki Cele and national commissioner General Khehla Sitole said they would not rest until they won the fight against gangsterism. Addressing MPs, residents, members of Cosatu and Popcru, Cele said they were proud of the progress made by the anti-gang unit in the Cape Flats and surrounding areas. “The unit has brought some sense of relaxation within these communities. “I have been to Utzig, Hanover Park and the Cape Flats getting feedback from the people. “Residents of Utzig for the first time say their kids can be sent to shops after 6pm,” said Cele. The unit has made more than 300 arrests since November. Cosatu’s Tony Ehrenreich said: “We must go after the drug lords and those people who are running shebeens.”
