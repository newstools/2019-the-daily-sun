PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has set the record straight that
he has never been a spy and never sold out. This comes after Ramaphosa was accused of being a spy by
Cope President Mosiuoa Lekota on Wednesday in Parliament at the SONA Debate. Lekota accused Ramaphosa of being rewarded by the apartheid
government's notorious special branch and being a sellout. Ramaphosa says he was arrested in his university days while
he was a member of the South African Student Organisation (SASO). “The issue they wanted from me was to give evidence against
accused number one, Saths Cooper, Muntu Myeza, Terror Lekota accused no: 3 and a
number of others,” he said. According to Ramaphosa, he refused to do so – he said they
thought they would use his father to put pressure on him to become a state
witness. “I refused, I said I will not do it,” Ramaphosa said. He says he was later arrested again, but he persisted in
refusing to give evidence. “And they said you are going to be like Nelson Mandela, you
are going to break rocks, on Robben Island. I said, in the end I would rather
go and break rocks. I will never betray my people,” Ramaphosa said.
