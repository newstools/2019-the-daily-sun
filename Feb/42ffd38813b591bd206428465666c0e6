ORLANDO Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic believes their win against AmaZulu on Saturday was a good confidence booster for his players. The Buccaneers walloped Usuthu 4-1 at Orlando Stadium to climb back to second on the Absa Premiership standings, and move to within two points of leaders Bidvest Wits. Their title aspirations, which were dented by a three game winless run, are now firmly back on track. Bucs had been dropping points at an alarming rate, having been forced to settle for a point in the Soweto derby and against Baroka FC. Things got worse when they suffered their third loss of the season against SuperSport United last week. Micho, however, is delighted with the response his charges gave and believes they are now playing with more freedom. “This was a good injection of motivation, given that we had not won since the game against Chippa,” said Micho. “It’s a huge boost of morale which we are looking to use in games to come. One good step, but still many more to come.” Micho, who has watched his team do all the right things except find the back of the net in recent games, hopes they have turned a corner. The Serbian tactician said the entire team had to look themselves in the mirror and find a way to turn things around. “Our problem has never been football,” added Micho. “Our problem was mental. We have come closer to the team trying to take some pressure off. “It’s important to take a long hard look at yourself and ask what it is that you are doing wrong, individually and as a team. “We had to unlock the legs of our players so that they can play with freedom and express themselves.” Micho will be hoping for more of the same from his charges in their next game against Golden Arrows at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm). But this will be a difficult match, considering Abafana Besthende have only lost once since Steve Komphela took charge in December. The reverse fixture finished in a goalless draw at Orlando Stadium.
