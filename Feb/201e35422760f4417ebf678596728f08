FIVE people died and 10 were critically injured when a cash-in-transit van collided with a Putco bus. The accident happened on Moloto Road on Monday evening. The busy road connects Mpumalanga with Limpopo and Gauteng. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, there were 80 passengers in the bus. Four died, while 23 were taken to hospital. A Toyota Avanza, which was also involved in the collision, had two passengers in it. The SBV vehicle had three, one of whom died. Another person, who is believed to be one of the bus passengers, died yesterday. Before help arrived, nearby business people and passersby tried to help the injured by taking them out of the bus, but most were stuck. Rescue workers had to use the jaws of life to free passengers from the wreckage. Mark Barrett, CEO of the SBV group, said he was deeply saddened by the crash. “I wish to extend our deepest sympathies to their families and to wish those who were injured a speedy recovery.” Minister of Transport Blade Nzimande also sent his condolences to the families and friends of those who died.
