MANY MPs have said Police Minister Bheki Cele did nothing wrong by not extending Ipid director Robert McBride’s contract. This comes after McBride wrote a letter to the portfolio committee on police, in which he said Cele had no right. It was revealed that McBride had written two letters to Cele in September and another in November, asking about his future. He had also asked Cele to advertise the position. The minister responded on 16 January, telling him he wouldn’t be renewing his contract, which ends tomorrow. MPs said the point raised by McBride, that Cele doesn’t have power to decide on his future, was misleading. NFP MP Ahmed Shaik-Emam said: “Clearly it indicates that Robert McBride knew that the minister is an interested party that he, in some way or another has to communicate or accept correspondence or a decision. “His interest is not Ipid. It is about getting a job. In my view the minister hasn’t done anything wrong.” ANC MP Martha Mmola said all along it was made to appear as if Cele was the one who had written a letter to McBride, but Cele was just responding. “When McBride sent all those letters to the minister, he forgot about the portfolio committee. We blamed the minister yesterday because we didn’t have these letters.”
