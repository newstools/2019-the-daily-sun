NTHABISENG Lephoi was buried on Saturday. The 33-year-old from Kagisanong in Mangaung and her boyfriend Tshepo Plaatjie were electrocuted at a tavern last Saturday. Nthabiseng was hugged by a friend as they leaned on a steel gate, which was touching a power source. Tshepo’s aunt Nomozwandile Plaatjie said: “I thought they would be the ones burying me.” Pastor Peter Peterson from Wife of Life Ministries said Nthabiseng had run her race and won it. “Nthabiseng isn’t with us anymore but with God.” Mourners wearing T-shirts with photos of the dead couple carried Nthabiseng’s coffin to the hearse and then went to South Park Cemetery. Lele Mamatu, spokesman for the Mangaung energy distributor Centlec, said they visited the tavern the day before the tragedy. “There was a complaint that sparks were coming from an electricity pole. We could not get into the property. A bulb in the yard was illegally connected.” Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said an inquest docket was opened.
