THE Automobile Association (AA) says Mzansi can expect a
fuel price increase. The AA was commenting on unaudited mid-month fuel price data
released by the Central Energy Fund. "Oil traded within a very tight band for most of
January, but we have seen a steady uptick since February began," the AA
said. â€œThis trend has accelerated in the last week in
particular." According to the AA the Rand is offsetting some of the oil
gains, has been on a weakening trend against the US dollar since the start of
February. "The Rand has slipped from R13.20 against the dollar on
1 February to R14.12 on 14 February. This is not good news for fuel users at a
time when oil is also rising," the AA says. The current data suggests a price increase of 43 cents a
litre is in the offing for petrol, 62 cents for diesel, and 47 cents for
illuminating paraffin.
