WORKERS are angry that they have not been paid, and they downed tools two weeks ago. Now, the burning of an eThekwini Municipality water tank and protests on the N2 have been linked to the ongoing strike by refuse collection workers. The truck, which was transporting water to Ngonyameni Village outside Umlazi, was petrol bombed by unknown people on Mangosuthu highway on Friday morning. Pictures of flames on the N2 highway circulated on social media. Delangokubona Business Forum leader Bhamuza Mnyandu said the two incidents could be the result of the municipality’s failure to pay. He said although they condemned what happened, people were angry that the municipality had not paid them since December. “People are hungry and are demanding their money, so we can’t control someone who’s angry. “We don’t know who burned the truck. All we’re saying is both incidents could be linked,” said Mnyandu. He said contractors met eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede and her officials on Thursday, but the meeting was not fruitful. The mayor allegedly promised to sort out the payment issue. Striking workers in Umlazi said they are angry that the municipality brought in workers from elsewhere to clean the township. They said they didn’t understand why the municipality didn’t pay them, as it had money to pay the other workers and Metro police officers who escorted the trucks. Municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the payment issue was being addressed after the mayor met contractors on Thursday. He said the mayor condemned the burning of the truck and other disruptions in Umlazi.
