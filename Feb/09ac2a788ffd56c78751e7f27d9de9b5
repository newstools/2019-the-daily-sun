IT WAS nothing short of chaos when over 40 children were removed from a minibus taxi on Monday. A video of the primary school pupils being taken off an overloaded 16-seater Quantum by Nelson Mandela Bay Metro cops soon went viral on social media. The video shows the cops doing a head count as kids leave the vehicle. In the end, it turns out 48 kids including the driver were in the taxi! Metro police chief Yolanda Faro said three to four children were sitting on top of each other. The incident happened on Stanford Road in Port Elizabeth, just after 2.30pm. “The Metro police were driving in the opposite direction when they spotted the taxi. They immediately made a U-turn and stopped the driver. The 26-year-old driver was arrested,” said Faro. She said the following day, a 25-year-old driver was spotted on Dyke Street with 38 high school pupils in a 16-seater taxi. “He was twice above the load and driving without a licence or a professional driving permit,” said Faro. Both drivers were charged with overloading. Faro appealed to drivers and parents to stop overloading. “Every passenger must be seated and drivers must be mindful of accidents. “Should the driver be involved in an accident while the vehicle is overloaded, passengers are more likely to suffer serious injuries, loss of limbs or even death,” she said. “We’re appealing to parents not to allow their children to get into an overloaded vehicle. They have the responsibility to ensure the vehicle transporting their children is roadworthy and the driver has a licence and a professional driving permit.”
