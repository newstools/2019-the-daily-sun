Mzansi artist Nelson Makamo's work has made it to the cover of TIME Magazine. Time is an American weekly news magazine and news website published in New York City. Makomo was born and raised in Modimolle Limpopo andis now based in Joburg. On Thursday, TIME magazine showed off the cover for their 2019 "optimists issue" - a beautiful portrait painted by the Mzansi artist. The piece, titled "Visions of a limitless future", is the first magazine cover that Nelson has ever produced. The magazine posted a video on Insta with the caption: "Art is worthy of our interrogation and is in fact an antidote for our times," writes @ava, guest-editor of @time’s second special issue devoted to #optimism. "In the issue, we celebrate and suggest ways that one can find inspiration in our present moment through the work of artists who carve a path for us all. Whether a filmmaker or a photographer, an author or an actress, a poet or a painter, these pages are filled with people who use art as a weapon for dynamic optimism."
