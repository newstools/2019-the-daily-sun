MALERATO Sebake didn’t think much about the lightning on Tuesday. But then she was called to the local soccer ground in Protea Glen, Soweto, because her 14-year-old son had been struck! Malerato told Daily Sun her son Nkabe was killed doing the thing he loved most. The 52-year-old said the incident was very strange as there were no clouds in sight and the sun was shining. She said a dark cloud came out of nowhere while her son and other boys were training. When she got to the scene, her son was very hot and one soccer boot was still on his foot. He was declared dead at the scene but Malerato refused to accept he was gone. When government mortuary workers arrived to take him away, she fought them. “I insisted that he should go to hospital. It only hit me when he was certified dead.” She said Nkabe’s life revolved around soccer and school. “He had dreams of playing for a big soccer team. He was supposed to go for trials for Kaizer Chiefs.” Twelve other children were also injured. ER24 emergency services said: “When paramedics arrived on the scene, fire and rescue services were already attending to the injured. “A child remained motionless on the field and was later declared dead. “Twelve boys received treatment, from third degree burns to muscle stiffness, and were taken to a nearby clinic.”
