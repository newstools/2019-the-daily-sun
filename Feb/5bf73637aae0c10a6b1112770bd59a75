A CASE has been opened against an ANC branch secretary who allegedly asked residents to pay for membership cards. Mnikezwa Mayeza (60), from Folweni, south of Durban, said: “She was charging R20 for a one-year membership card and R100 for a five-year membership.” Community leader Slindile Mbambo said they informed Councillor Thokozani Xulu, ANC NEC member Senzo Mchunu and eThekwini regional secretary Bheki Ntuli about the matter. Mchunu said: “If she committed the crime she must face the consequences,” Ntuli said: “We could not assist them because of the December holidays and the ANC anniversary celebrations.” Xulu said: “I am surprised they reported the matter to the media instead of going through the party structures. I know nothing about this.” Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of theft by false pretences was opened.
