FITA Khupe will spend more nights in jail as he’s bail was
denied. Vlakfontein community in the Protea Magistates court’s
gallery cheered and applauded when Magistrate, David Mhango declined the
application when he delivered the judgement. He said that the charges the 61-year-old is facing are
serious and has no doubt that Khupe is a flight risk. Mhango said Khupe is facing seven counts of murder and each
with a minimum sentence of a life imprisonment. “Mr Khupe is a Zimbabwean national, should be admitted bail
and go to Zimbabwe, it will be difficult for investigation officer to get him.” He also added that if he gets bail, that will disturb public
peace. The case has been postponed to 2 April for further
investigation. Outside court, community members were in a celebratory mood
as they danced and chanted “Sizo fika I’sgwebo.”
