HAWKERS who do business along Democracy Way in Joe Slovo, Milnerton are tired of the sewage that flows in the street. They said whenever the problem is fixed, it’s not long before smelly water starts flowing in the streets again. “Some of us sell food and clients end up avoiding this place because it stinks,” said hawker Noncedo Dubase (56). Hairdresser Nomsa Tshuma (36) said not many people came to her salon. “Styling someone’s hair takes a long time and people can’t endure the stench,” she said. Residents said the problem might be more serious than they think. Cape Town water and waste MMC Xanthea Limberg said the issue was reported on Saturday. “The matter was attended to and resolved on the same day,” he said.
