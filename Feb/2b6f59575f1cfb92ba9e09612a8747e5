KZN Transport and Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has called for harsh sentences for speeding motorists. This is after a Durban Metro cop was caught allegedly driving at 228km per hour on Saturday. Mlindi Pato (29), whom sources in the Metro police department claim is the bodyguard of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede, was bust by traffic officers on the N2 freeway near Mandeni. A source claimed the matter was being swept under the carpet. They heard he was released the same day on R3 000 bail. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said Pato was charged with exceeding the speed limit and appeared in the Umtunzini Magistrates Court on Monday. Transport spokesman Mluleki Mtungwa said they noted the cop’s arrest and called for harsher sentences for anyone disobeying traffic rules. He said the MEC was concerned as speeding was a major contributor to road accidents. “We call on the justice system not to be lenient when handing down sentences for speeding,” said Mtungwa. He said a Polo driver was also arrested for doing 164km per hour. He said people driving over 160km per hour were not fined, but criminally charged. eThekwini municipal spokesman Mthunzi Gumede said the law must be allowed to take its course. He denied that the cop was the mayor’s bodyguard. However another Metro cop claimed the man was attached to the mayoral protection unit.
