NOMBULELO’S wedding pictures are gone. All Nombulelo Maluleka (32) from Diepkloof, Soweto, wants is the video and photos of her special day. When she got married in October, she hired photographers who charged her R1 000 for taking photos and a video of her big day. She was stunned by the price when she saw their advert on Facebook. Although it sounded too good to be true, she met up with them anyway to ensure they were legit. “ I decided I could actually trust these guys. They seemed reliable.” Little did Nombulelo know she would never collect those memories of her wedding. “I would have hired expensive photographers if I’d known this was a scam,” she said. She told Daily Sun she didn’t really care about the money she spent but was devastated not to get her photos. “I am deeply hurt. They are gone with the memories of the best moment of my life,” Nombulelo said. Daily Sun tried to call the photographers but couldn’t reach them. They don’t have an e-mail address and calls to all their phone numbers went straight to voicemail. Nombulelo encouraged soon-to-be married couples to verify suppliers before giving them money. “I didn’t listen to my gut feeling. Just make sure you find someone you can trust,” she said. Police said this was a civil matter and was out of their hands, but Nombulelo has gone to court over the matter.
