THESE residents live in constant terror of being swallowed by the earth. This is because the people at Makause squatter camp in Primrose, Ekurhuleni, live metres away from sinkholes that grow bigger every day. Residents told the SunTeam they have been dumping rubbish in the holes in the hope of filling them up but they just keep growing. They said they have been living in the area for years and have nowhere else to go. They said the holes were first closed by the municipality a few years ago but the recent heavy rain caused them to open up again. When the SunTeam visited the area on Sunday, residents said they had reported the matter but nothing was done. One community leader said in 2007, a woman fell into an old mining shaft in the area and died of her injuries. “We fear the same thing will happen again. People around here are not safe because we are on top of mine shafts that can open up at any time.” The squatter camp was first started by miners but later grew when zama zamas started moving into the area. When the SunTeam called Councillor Frans Ngomane, he said it was unfair of residents to phone the newspaper, instead of approaching him. “You need permission to come and take photos. You don’t just rock up,” he said. But the residents said they called the media because they had lost hope in local leaders. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said he wasn’t aware of the situation but would send a team to investigate.
