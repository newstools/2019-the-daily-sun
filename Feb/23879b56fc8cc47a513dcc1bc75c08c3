GATVOL residents of Makhulong and Winnie Mandela Park in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, recently marched to Human Settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya’s offices in Germiston. The march started at Makhulong and ended in Gemiston, where they handed over of a memorandum of grievances. Residents claimed they were promised RDPs a long time ago at the open space between Makhulong and Winnie Mandela Park. “During the launch of the Thuma Mina campaign last year, President Cyril Ramaphosa promised us we’d get land. And we’ve heard nothing since then,” said Phindile Nene, a community leader, on Friday. “Community leaders tried engaging with the ward councillor, but the response from the Ekurhuleni Metro was that they don’t have enough funding for the project.” She said people were fed up. Resident Bonny Mphahlele said he’s been staying in backrooms for 13 years. “When it’s time to vote they promise us many things but don’t care after that,” said Bonny. Mpya told residents: “We’l look into the matter. But before we commit we’ll have to check if the land is suitable for residential use.”
