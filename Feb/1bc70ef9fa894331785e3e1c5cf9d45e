ON WEDNESDAY, student leaders celebrated the release of four of their comrades. The case against the four was struck off the roll in the Durban Magistrates Court due to lack of evidence. They were bust during a protest at the Durban University of Technology on Tuesday. But a guard accused of shooting a student near the Steve Biko campus on the day of the protest has not been bust. Mlungisi Madonsela (20) died of injuries after being rushed to hospital. Student leader Nombuso Mbatha said: “You have a dead student but his killer was taken in for questioning and later released. “Then you have four students who spent 24 hours in jail, only to find there is no evidence linking them to the case.” He welcomed their release but said management was not being hands on. Vice-chancellor Thandwa Mthembu said an internal investigation was under way.
