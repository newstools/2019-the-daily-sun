A SOCIAL media storm has driven Italian fashion house Gucci to withdraw a polo neck jumper and apologise for being racially insensitive. Angry twitter users slammed the company for designing something that looks like “blackface”. The “balaclava” style knitted item was on sale for $890 (about R12 000). On Wednesday night, Gucci said: “We consider diversity to be a fundamental value to be fully upheld, respected, and at the forefront of every decision we make. We are fully committed to increasing diversity throughout our organization.”
