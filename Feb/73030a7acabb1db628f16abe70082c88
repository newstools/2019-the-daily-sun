VYTJIE Mentor’s credibility suffered another blow yesterday when an expert said features of the Gupta home she described did not exist. Architect Erna Wiese yesterday told the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Joburg, that she and her team went to the Gupta home in Saxonwold in December for a visual inspection but Mentor could not point out most of the things she claimed to have seen in the house in 2010. “She couldn’t point out the Gupta house immediately. She couldn’t identify the house with 100% certainty,” said Wiese. She said when inside, they could not find a huge pillar Mentor said was there. “Our visual clues gave us no indication that a pillar was ever there. The windows also didn’t correlate with the brief,” she said. Mentor told the commission the house had a golden bathroom but Wiese said all they found was an old guest bedroom with very few gold finishes. Wiese said only the kitchen looked as Mentor had described it.
