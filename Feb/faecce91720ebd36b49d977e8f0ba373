A MAN was bust for possession of stolen vehicles in Tsonga, Mpumalanga on Tuesday. The vehicles were apparently being driven to Mozambique by several men. The arrest came after an operation was carried out by police who received a tip-off about the four stolen vehicles – a Ford Ranger, Toyota truck, Isuzu truck and a bakkie. The vehicles were all stolen in Gauteng. According to police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, the suspects were reportedly staying at a lodge in Hectorspruit, not far from the border. He said they were waiting for a signal from some of their friends. “Cops stormed the premises. “They arrested a 30-year-old man but his friends fled the scene on foot,” said Bhembe. “The vehicles were impounded by police.” Bhembe said the suspect will appear in the Komatipoort Magistrates Court soon, facing charges of possession of stolen motor vehicles.
