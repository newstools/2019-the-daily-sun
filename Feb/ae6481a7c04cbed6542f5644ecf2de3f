YET another DA billboard has been vandalised. On Monday, the sign reading: “The ANC has killed the lights, affecting 57 million South Africans,” was set alight. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said although they didn’t know who vandalised the billboard on Queen Elizabeth Bridge going to the Joburg CBD, it was not the first time this had happened. The previous billboard, which read “The ANC is killing us,” had the names of Life Esidimeni victims written on it and was torn down by people claiming to be their families. At the time, the DA said the names of the victims were on public record and they didn’t need the families’ permission to use them. The DA has laid charges as the Electoral Act states it’s illegal to remove or damage signs put up by registered candidates between the time that an election is announced and when it is held. Steenhuisen said the DA would not allow vandalism to stop them. “No amount of vandalism or arson will hide the fact that Eskom continues to fail in its mandate to provide services to the people of South Africa.” He said the DA would fix the billboard. “The sabotage of the DA billboard does not change the fact that under the failing ANC, Eskom poses the biggest economic risk to South Africa. The people of South Africa have once again been plunged into darkness while those implicated in state capture corruption keep their illicit gains,” said Steenhuisen.
