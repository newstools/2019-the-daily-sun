DORCAS Mathulwe was fast asleep on Sunday night when her mum suddenly appeared in her dreams, warning her there was danger in her house. And when the 54-year-old from Payneville in Springs, Ekurhuleni woke up, she found a burning CD at her front door! The CD was apparently placed there to drug her so thugs could enter her house and clean her out. “My house was filled with smoke but I couldn’t open the windows. I covered my nose with a damp cloth and when I opened the door, I saw thugs jumping over the fence and fleeing.” Dorcas said she was grateful to her mum, who died last year. “It’s a clear sign my mum’s looking after me. This isn’t the first time thugs have tried to get into my house but they always fail.” She said she recently renovated her house which could be the reason she was targeted. Another resident, Refilwe Ngwenya, said crime in the area was very high. “We suspect the thugs come from neighbouring squatter camps. The police are not doing enough,” she said. Springs police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said residents should be careful when they find strange things in their yards. “We have had several cases of thugs burning CDs, not only in Springs.”
