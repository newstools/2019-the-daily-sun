ANOTHER politician has died in a violent attack. SACP regional secretary Mhlengi Khumalo was killed at his home in KwaPata, outside Pietermaritzburg in KZN, on Tuesday. His friend Msizi Ngcobo said he wanted government leaders to tackle political killings. “Mhlengi was struck by about 32 bullets. “Neighbours saw two gunmen wearing balaclavas enter his yard. Then they heard gunshots,” he said. He said Khumalo was alone at the time of his death. Daily Sun was unable to contact Mhlengi’s sister Khumbuzile. SACP Harry Gwala secretary Luhle Ndlovu expressed concern at the instability in KwaPata and said the party would call a meeting with the ANC and Cosatu. Mhlengi’s death comes two days after SACP member Vusi Sibiya survived an attack on Sunday. KwaPata has been unstable since the killing of ANC Councillor Msawenkosi Mchunu. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of murder was opened at Plessislaer Police Station.
