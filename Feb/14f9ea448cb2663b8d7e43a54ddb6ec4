GATVOL parents yesterday protested outside the district office of the department of education in Port Elizabeth. Angry parents from Booysens Park and Chatty Extension said the department undermined their children’s right to education by not building a school in ward 29 and failing to supply enough teachers at Alfonso Aries Primary School. School governing body chairman Jonas Luyanda said the school had 1 700 pupils and 37 teachers. “There are a lot of children squatting in classrooms because there is no space for them. We have informed the department several times, but they did not listen to our cries,” he said. “There was not enough space at other schools so children were sent to Alfonso Aries because it is the only school in the area where Xhosa is the medium of instruction. “We told the department that Alfonso Aries should be built with bricks and not have mobile classrooms as they are not strong. They are also very cold in winter and very hot in summer.” The education department’s Viwe Madonci asked the parents to choose a delegation to discuss their problems in their office. “I don’t know anything about this situation, but I will call responsible officials to address you,” he told them.
