MZANSI Billionaire Patrice Motsepe  has responded to claims that  the Eskom unbundling will benefit his firm, African Rainbow Energy and Power. Mostepe’s name came up in parliament when President Cyril Ramaphosa was accused of trying to use Eskom to help his in-laws. Last year, Malema warned that Motsepe’s ties to President Cyril Ramphosa and Energy Minister Jeff Radebe – who are married to Motsepe sisters - were dangerous. MALEMA TO MOTSEPE: 'WE ARE WATCHING YOU' He said that he has never supported the privatisation of or sale of Eskom and none of the businesses that he's part of or is associated with. Motsepe said allegations that himself and President Cyril Ramaphosa stand to benefit from the Independent Power Producers' contract from the Energy Department are ridiculous and outrageous. Motsepe said himself and his family have been very compliant to the laws of SA, and that he notes that it is now time for elections, and believe that lots of things will be said about him. He said having relatives in high positions in government justifies the perception of favouritism or improper conduct, particularity in the context of the IPPs programs where the re is a relationship with the energy minister, Jeff Radebe. “AREP or any other company that i’m associated with will therefore not participate or be part of any sale or disposal of Eskom,” said Motsepe.
