A MAN of God is the new mayor of Emfuleni, Ekurhuleni. Reverend Gift Moerane was elected and sworn in yesterday during a special council meeting at Sharpeville Hall, south of Joburg. Jacob Khawe resigned in December after he was elected as ANC Gauteng secretary. ANC provincial spokeswoman Tasneem Motara said: “Reverend Moerane is a man of the people. He has impeccable integrity and unquestionable credentials.” Moerane said he was ready to fix the municipality. “We’re going to make sure Sharpeville is fixed. It should look like a city before 21 March.” ANC Gauteng chairman David Makhura said Moerane was the best man for the job. He said Moerane was someone people would be able to relate to.
