THE City of Cape Town spends more than R300 million a year on cleaning up illegal dump sites. Mayor Dan Plato said the city would no longer tolerate illegal dumping. He urged the public to come forward with any information that would help them identify the culprits. “The type of behaviour displayed by these offenders is unacceptable,” he said. “It is not only a risk to the environment, but to the public’s health, too. “I have asked the city’s law enforcement officers to keep an eye out for those suspected of illegal dumping. “These criminals are placing a massive burden on our staff.” He also said the city has 26 drop-off sites for garden refuse, building material and any other items that don’t fit into household wheelie bins. “These are more than enough ways dispose of waste legally,” he said. Anyone found guilty of illegal dumping would be fined R5 000. “Members of the public can report illegal dumping by calling 021 480 7700.”
