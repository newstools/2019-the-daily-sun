PARENTS of pupils at Boschrand Primary School in Msholozi, outside White River in Mpumalanga, are worried about the health of their children. Their kids were allegedly bitten by pests at the school. The school has been using zozo houses as classrooms for more than 10 years. One of the parents, Margareth Mdaka (38), said the problem started two weeks ago. She told Daily Sun that pupils started getting sick on Monday, but everything was taken lightly. “The problem continued on Tuesday. Pupils were scratching themselves and we knew there was a problem. “ Kids started getting blisters and sores on their bodies,” she said. The SGB suspended classes. Margareth said they didn’t want to risk anyone’s health and they resorted to suspending classes. “It hurts to see our children missing school because of a problem we raised years ago with the department. We told the department that these zozo classrooms would be a problem in the long run, but we were ignored.” Last year, parents and pupils marched to the Mpumalanga provincial office to demand a proper school. Mpumalanga Department of Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they had requested the health department to fumigate the school. “As for the construction of a school, we can confirm that a site was allocated and due processes of planning and design to build the school are underway,” he said.
