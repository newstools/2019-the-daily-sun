Joburg Metro Police chief David Tembe has released a report on crime and crime-fighting efforts. He said drunken driving was still a big problem in Joburg. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba said with 557 arrests in January, driving under the influence still remained a major concern. He said the statistics collected since September have become a tool for officers as well as a way to inform residents. “Top arrests for the month included possession of a hijacked or stolen vehicle, for possession of stolen goods and for reckless and negligent driving.” He said the region where most arrests took place was Alexandra and Sandton, where 117 arrests were made. “It is significantly higher than in the other regions,” said Mashaba. Tembe said they will work tirelessly to fight crime in the city. “Speed cameras are back,” he said. Illegal dumping was also a serious problem and they were organising a unit to deal with it. “When we find people dumping, they have to pay a fine of R3 000. But this seems too low as people continue to do it,” he said. He said zama zamas were also a major problem and greatly affected the city’s economy.
