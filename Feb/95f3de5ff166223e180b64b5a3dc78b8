NO, Uncle Gwede hasn’t joined the VW Polo playas club! In a video posted on Twitter on Monday, Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe is seen getting out of a white VW Polo at the Investing in African Mining Indaba in Cape Town. Social media users, used to seeing ministers in big, luxurious German SUVs, were surprised to see the humble Polo. Replying to the video, which had more than 25 000 views in just a few hours, many speculated his arrival was a publicity stunt. Others asked why he never shared videos of himself getting out of SUVs. Others commended him for using a Polo and urged other ministers to follow his example. Spokesman Nathi Shabangu said: “The minister used a vehicle which was available at the time.”
