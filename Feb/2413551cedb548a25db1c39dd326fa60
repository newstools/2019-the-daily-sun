MAVI Fundakubi’s family wants his killer to be punished harshly. The 52-year-old from Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, was killed last month by a group of residents who accused him of raping a seven-year-old girl. His family said his killers initially promised to bury him but went back on their word. Now the family wants them to rot in jail. The father (36) of the girl who was allegedly raped was said to be part of the group that beat Mavi to death. He handed himself over to police after it was established that his daughter was not raped. He briefly appeared in the Motherwell Magistrates Court yesterday and his case was postponed to 14 February for a formal bail application. Mavi’s daughter Thobeka Fundakubi (26) said: “We won’t have peace after what they did to our father. They made things worse by letting us down. “We asked them to assist us with funeral arrangements. “They agreed but never bothered to come back to us. “We want the girl’s father to receive a harsh punishment for what he did.” She said they also wanted to know who the other killers were as the man was not alone on that day. “My father won’t come back and no one can replace his love, but I still want justice for him. “All those who were involved must rot in jail,” she said. The state’s case is that the accused fetched Mavi from his home before assaulting him with the help of community members.
