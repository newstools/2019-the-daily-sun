 Mpumalanga police are looking for a man who shot and killed
a 55-year-old sangoma. The incident reportedly happened in Hartebeeskop, near
Carolina. According to police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe, the traditional healer was at home together with his family when they heard a
dog bark outside. “He asked a family member to go and check. When that member
arrived at the gate, there was a man believed to be in his 30s, who reportedly
needed to see the healer for a consultation session,” Bhembe said. The family members said after some time, they heard gunshots
being fired and went to check at the consultation room, where they were met by
the healer's body lying in a pool of blood. The suspect was
reportedly nowhere to be found. In another incident that took place at Breyten, near
Carolina, a 49-year-old man was when he appeared in court for a murder charge. It is alleged that on 14 February 2019, the suspect went to
his house where he found his wife, who is a practicing traditional healer, with
another man. An argument ensued between the two when suddenly the suspect
reportedly took out a knife and stabbed the other man on the upper body several
times before fleeing the scene. The victim was later on declared dead by paramedics. Mathunjwa is expected to appear on 15 March 2019, for a
formal bail application.
