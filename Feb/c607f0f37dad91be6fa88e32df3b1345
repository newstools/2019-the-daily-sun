GRIEF is written on the face of Sipho Dladla (56). Sipho lives in a two-roomed mud house in Enseleni, near Greytown, KZN Midlands. The house used to have four rooms, but the other two were damaged by heavy rain and strong wind three years ago. He told Daily Sun he fears the house will collapse on him because it’s old. “I built this house around 2007,” said Sipho. “After that I lost my job. I wasn’t lucky enough to find another one. “The house then started falling apart because of severe storms.” He said his house is in a bad condition. “Rain leaks into my house and wind blows through it. That keeps me awake the whole night,” he said. Sipho said piece jobs are his only source of income. When the SunTeam asked whether he receives any financial support from his family, he said his parents died when he was young. “I have two kids, but my son abandoned me after we had a few disagreements. “I don’t know where he lives, nor how to contact him. “My daughter lived with her mum. “I’ve never had a relationship with her. I doubt she can help me.” Umvoti mayor Thami Ngubane said he was unaware of Sipho’s plight. “But I will send a team to check the situation at his house. “Then we will take it from there,” said Ngubane
