Striking students at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) shut down the education campus on Wednesday. As they were singing and dancing around the campus, they clashed with security guards who were trying to close gates to prevent them from going into some parts of the university. The protesting students who came in their numbers didn’t take that lying down, as they tried to beat up one of the security guards at the campus. The protest come after the university reportedly backed out of an agreement they had with the SRC – to allow students that owe less than R100 000 be allowed to register and start with their lectures. On Monday the SRC deputy president Nkateko Muloiwa said they were disrupting lectures because it is unfair that other students have already started lectures. “Now they are taking us for fools and not keeping their promise,” he said.
