THUGS went to a farm and made off with thousands of rands worth of chickens. They stuffed the birds into their van and left. But the chickens kept making a noise and this led to the thugs’ arrest. After police in Springs, Ekurhuleni, conducted an investigation, they discovered more chickens stolen by the same suspects. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said three suspects were arrested for business robbery, stock theft and possession of stolen goods on Sunday. Ramphora said one of the suspects was an employee at the chicken farm in Welgedacht. “Two employees were checking on the chickens when they were confronted by five men. “One was armed with a firearm, while the others were armed with knives. “They tied the workers to a pole in the field outside the chicken farm. “The workers heard the van going in and out of the farm about three times. “They were released at about 3:15am by one of the suspects who was guarding them,” he said. He said after the employees were released, they returned to the farm and noticed about R60 000 worth of chickens were stolen. A cellphone was taken from one of the workers. The chickens were returned to their owners.
