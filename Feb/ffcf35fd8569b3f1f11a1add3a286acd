BRAND-CONSCIOUS people don’t know they’re drinking fake alcohol and wearing fong kong clothes. This emerged yesterday when cops seized fake products to the value of R80 million at a private container depot in City Deep, Joburg.  Cheap alcohol was being put into bottles of expensive booze and fake brand name T-shirts were hidden in cold drink cans. Cops told Daily Sun the fake products had come from China. Border police unit commander Colonel Bathandwa Mdleleni said some of the containers had furniture packed into the front and counterfeit clothing hidden behind. “We found big labels such as Gucci, Levi’s, Adidas and Nike,” he said.  They also found food products. “Laws around the importing of goods clearly state that if you are transporting goods to another country, the branding should be in the language of the country they are going to. These goods’ branding was in Chinese.” Gauteng police spokeswoman Lieutenant- Colonel Katlego Mogale said four criminal cases were opened. “We are investigating cases of illegal importation of goods without valid permits, the contravention of health regulations, copyright acts and tax evasion,” she said. No arrests were made.
