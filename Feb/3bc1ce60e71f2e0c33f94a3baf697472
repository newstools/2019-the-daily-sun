WHEN Ladin Sibanda (39) realised he wasn’t going to get a job, he decided to use his talent to make a living. Ladin, who comes from Musina, Limpopo, is now living in Peter Swartz kasi, Bloemfontein. He makes a living by selling his work to the local community and tourists. Ladin told Daily Sun he came to the Free State 10 years ago and when he didn’t get work, he decided to make steel pots, security gates and rails for graves. “When I started, I wasn’t at the top of my game but with time, I got better. “Now my business has attracted customers who keep me busy six days a week. I rest on Sundays,” he said. When the business is doing well, Ladin takes home about R6 000 per month. “This helps me put food on the table for my five children. The money also pays for their school fees and transport,” he said. Ladin urged young people to use their talents to survive because there is so little work in Mzansi.
