PLUS size people have been labelled unhealthy for ages, but Mabontle Mphosi (27) is fighting to disprove that myth. Mabontle from Olifantsfontein, south of Tshwane, started a movement called Sdudla Chronicles. The members of Sdudla Chronicles take pictures of themselves in bikinis and sexy outfits and post them on social media. Mabontle said the group wanted to inspire women to be comfortable in their skin. “We want them to know that it’s okay to be big, as long as you live a healthy lifestyle,” she said. Mabontle has also hosted pool parties for plus size women. The women have a good time while sharing the challenges they have faced. Sdudla Chronicle member Dineo Malema (26) said she had learnt to appreciate her body. “I grew up with a low self-esteem and couldn’t wear the clothes I wanted to. But that changed when I met Mabontle,” she said. “I can now wear my short skirt without feeling guilty.”
