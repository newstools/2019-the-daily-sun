THREE families have been given the helping hand they need to make a living. The North West Agriculture and Rural Development Department last Tuesday handed over goods in Rustenburg at the launch of a food security project. The project, worth R5,5 million, aims to restore people’s dignity and is targeted at the youth, women, people with disabilities and the poor. It will provide goats, chickens and vegetable seeds to 200 households, to create business and jobs. Acting MEC Mpho Motlhabane said people needed to learn to use their hands. “The department is trying to ensure communities don’t live in poverty, but it’s also up to the community to make sure this does not happen,” he told the People’s Paper. Motlhabane urged residents to help the families so the whole community could benefit from the project. Mmadira Phetoe (53) said the 11 goats she received were a gift from God. She said she had experience with goats as she used to help her uncle look after his. “I was not expecting these goats, but I’m thankful because this is wealth – this is job creation. I’m excited,” she said. “I already know what needs to be done and I look forward to them multiplying. Thank you.”
