THREE years have passed and Maria Makete’s RDP is still not finished. When the 40-year-old from extension 21 in Nellmapius, Tshwane was told that a house would be built for her, she tore down two rooms of her four-roomed shack to make space for the new house. While other people in the area received their homes in 2017, Maria has been waiting. She said she was cramped in a two-roomed shack with her husband and three children. “All our furniture is here. When I’m cooking my kids have to wait in the unfinished house,” she said. Maria wants to know if the house will ever be finished. “I’ve been sent from pillar to post for a long time. I’m tired of this,” she said. Daily Sun contacted Councillor Joel Masilela, who said three contractors failed to do their work. He said a programme had been put in place to finish the incomplete houses.
