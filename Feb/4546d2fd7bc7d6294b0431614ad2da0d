A MIDDLE-AGED man is facing serious jail time for his vicious
treatment of a teen girl – including forcing her to let a dog poke her. According to Sydney Morning Herald, Jeffrey Lee (49) got
involved with a girl 27 years younger than him when she was just 15 years old
in 2012. He frequently took her to remote areas around Melbourne,
Australia to take drugs and have sex. On two occasions, Lee made a dog he had
access to poke the girl – once while she was unconscious. He also livestreamed them having sex together and took
pornographic photos of her to post online. On another occasion, Lee plunged a fishing spear into the
girl’s arm during an argument. He yanked it out, bound the wound with a sock
and refused to let her go to hospital. The girl paid the price too for the two stars she tattooed
on her legs with a tattoo gun of his that she used without asking. He tried to
cut out the two tattoos with a knife. Lee pleaded guilty to all charges in 2017. He has been
locked up anyway since 2016 for killing his stepfather. Justice Michael Elkaim on Thursday sentenced Lee to 13
years more in jail for two charges of sexual intercourse with a minor, three
charges of bestiality, several assault charges and multiple counts of creating
and distributing child pornography. In sentencing, Justice Elkaim said while the girl had
lasting physical scars, the psychological wounds inflicted "upon her have
been overwhelming and will probably dictate aspects of her life for very many
years to come". The judge also said the dog’s health had suffered after
the incidence, making Lee’s treatment of the dog animal cruelty.
