Pastor Lukau is living large.  THE Leader of Allelua International Ministries, who recently claimed to have brought a dead man back to life, is one of the richest church leaders in Mzansi.  After a video of him raising a man from the dead went viral, Social Media users started sharing pictures of his expensive cars and other properties.  If the pictures are anything to go by, then the self-proclaimed prophet is really 'blessed'.  In one of the videos, Lukau's car is seen escorted by cops on his way to church.  He arrives at the church like a king and could be seen being saluted by the guy who opened a car door for him.
