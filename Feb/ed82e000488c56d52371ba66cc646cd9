Rapper, Sizwe ‘Reason’ Moeketsi has once again showed some major PDA for his bae and baby momma, Luthando ‘LootLove’ Shosa. The couple, who recently gave birth to twins, have been together since 2015. Their love has played out in the media with their ups and downs being made readily available for everyone to see. Our sister publication, Sunday Sun first broke the news of the relationship in November 2015 reporting then that Loot had left former Orlando Pirates star, Lennox Bacela for the arms of Reason. Since then, there has been sexy videos being released, sweet birthday messages being exchanged and constant PDAs that leave us all green with envy. ICYMI: SIGNS THAT LOOTLOVE HAS GIVEN BIRTH After the couple announced their pregnancy last year, they have both been beaming with love and joy. And it’s even worse now that they’ve welcomed their son and daughter into the world. The happy couple can’t have their days ruined by anything lately. Even the usually clapback-ready LootLove is letting trolls slide on the internet these days. Plus, on top of being nice to everyone else, they’re also being the absolute sweetest to each other. PICS: INSIDE LOOTLOVE’S FABULOUS BABY SHOWER Loot was being her new bubbly self recently when she tweeted: “Morning Huns... Have a beautiful day”. And just like that, Reason just couldn’t help but gush over her. “Same to you my king. Please try get some rest. Lemme know if I need to bring you anything on the way home. I’ll be there as soon as possible to come & rub your feet and whisper cute things to you all night nneh? Love you,” he said with a heart-eyed emoji. Oh and FYI, if ever you were still uncertain, this definitely confirms that Loot has, indeed, given birth to the twins.
