ABAHLALI baseMjondolo celebrated on Thursday after winning its court battle. The Durban High Court granted the shack dwellers’ movement a court order to stop eThekwini Municipality’s land invasion unit from demolishing shacks at Cato Crest. Residents of eKhenana have had to sleep in the veld several times since the unit started targeting them. The Movements’ president Sbu Zikode told Daily Sun: “They have suffered violent and illegal evictions since October. “The municipality has repeatedly demolished people’s homes, confiscating and burning their building materials and other belongings. “Women and children have suffered the most at the hands of the municipality, which claims to be a caring one.” Zikode said the municipality constantly evicted people violently and even used live ammunition against unarmed residents. “In all their evictions, they have ignored the law. They treat us as if we are beneath the law. “Over the years, we have won a number of court cases against them.” Zikode said they went to court in December to seek a court order and the matter was postponed. “Residents were not supposed to build on the land and the municipality was not supposed to evict people while the matter was being handled in court,” he said. “But as always, the municipality acted in full violation of this and continued to evict residents.” They had no choice last week but to return to court. “The court did not hesitate to recognise the culprit in this matter and gave us an interdict against the municipality.”
