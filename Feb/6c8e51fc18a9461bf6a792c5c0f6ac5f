HE calls himself the fixer of lonely hearts! And he’s here to please lonely women. Vido Valche (25) from East London, Eastern Cape, has turned being there for lonely women into a business. He told Daily Sun: “I offer good morning texts, breakfast in bed, and unlimited intimacy,” he said. Vido said he wanted to emphasise that his services were only for women for now. “We’ll cater to everyone as soon as I’m able to employ more side dishes,” he said. The SunTeam spoke to one of Vido’s happy clients, who said: “He’s holding my marriage together. “He satisfies me and I have no reason to leave my marriage. They both play different roles.”
