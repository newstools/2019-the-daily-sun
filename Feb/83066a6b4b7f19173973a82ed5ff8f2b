GOSPEL singer Charity Musukwa wants to tell her story through music. In 2013 she was involved in a car accident and was declared dead by doctors, but miraculously regained consciousness. “When I died I could see my body and the people who were surrounding it. “Doctors declared me dead but I came back to life because God wanted me to save lives through my music. “Doctors still call me to find out if I’m fine, because my story was unbelievable,” she said. Charity told SunBuzz she started singing at church and became a Sunday School conductor of the choir at the age of six. Two years later she joined a group called Angel’s Choir, where she was the youngest member. She released her debut album, Lord Speak That I May Speak, in 2006, but took a break from music afterwards. Charity said she was still a high school pupil at the time. “I realised I’d be under a lot of pressure so I decided to stop making music. “I didn’t even release an album because I needed to focus on school.” She re-released her album in 2011. In 2016 she started working on her second album, Miracle, Signs and Wonders. The album is filled with testimonies about her life, her accident and her observations about the world. “I want my album to teach people about God’s wonders because I’m a living miracle. “The one thing I sing about the most is unity. I want people to come together because at the end of the day, we all praise one God.”.
