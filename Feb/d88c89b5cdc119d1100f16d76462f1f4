DURBAN celebrity business couple Sbu and Shauwn Mpisane are expected to appear in the Durban High Court today. They apparently have filed for divorce after rumours of cracks in their marriage first started in 2016. Family spokeswoman Siphokazi Mpisane and Shauwn’s stylist Andile Naki both refused to comment after attempts to get Shauwn and Sbu failed. There have been rumours that all is not well with their marriage since their financial problems started in 2012. Their Zikhulise Construction company has been getting RDP tenders worth millions from eThekwini Municipality. In 2012, Sars seized several of their expensive cars and properties. It had been found their companies owed R204 million in tax. The tax evasion charges were dropped in 2014 and their assets returned. In September, over 230 of their employees took them to the CCMA over severance pay dating back to 2012. In December, the CCMA ordered them to pay 167 employees R425 737,84 severance pay within 30 days but ruled 69 weren’t entitled to a payout.
