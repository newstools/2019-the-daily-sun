ABOUT 200 residents torched three vehicles and looted a delivery van during a protest. Residents of Nomakanjane squatter camp in Kamvelihle, Port Elizabeth, started protesting on Wednesday night, demanding houses, roads, sanitation and electricity. “We were promised services a long time ago, but nothing has happened,” said a community leader. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said protests erupted on Wednesday night between Addo Road and Motherwell. The road was blocked and tyres and rubbish burnt. Beetge said public order police dispersed the protesters after a truck was burned at a municipal depot. “Protesters completely burned a bus from Algoa Bus Company and looted a delivery van,” he said. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Some of the issues are for the provincial and national governments. “But we will do our best to address issues where the municipality is mandated.”
