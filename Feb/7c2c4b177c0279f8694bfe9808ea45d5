THE last thing Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane needs is to go into Caf Champions League battle with a team low on morale. On the back of two back-to-back defeats, the Tshwane giants now go into the Champions League group A battle with Asec Mimosas at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (9pm) on shaky ground. A week which started terribly with a premature Nedbank Cup exit got worse for the Brazilians as they sunk to a shock 2-0 league defeat to AmaZulu on Tuesday. That’s not to mention the controversy sparked by Toni Silva, who wrote a scathing open letter to Mosimane. Asec Mimosas couldn’t visit at the worst time! But Downs have been here before and Mosimane knows exactly how to coax better play from his boys. “You just have to work on the players’ minds because you don’t want to lose their confidence,” said Mosimane. “These are difficult times. But this is when the whole team comes together. And I am talking about everybody: the management, the board and the supporters because these are difficult times.” A meticulous planner, Mosimane has already done his homework on the visiting Ivorians. “I’m expecting a difficult game,” said Mosimane. “We’ve got to be strong and ready to penetrate their defence and guard against the counter-attacks and set-pieces. We don’t look on corner-kicks at the moment. And you know West Africans are big boys, so we’ve been working around the clock to prepare. It’s more about mental challenge than physical. We’ve been through this route and we expected this and we need to deal with it. One win will lift us.”
