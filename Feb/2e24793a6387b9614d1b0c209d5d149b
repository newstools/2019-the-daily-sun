RESIDENTS are worried that their bridge is being destroyed by nyaope boys. They said the bridge that connects Mountain View and Phola Park near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga is shaking and dangerous for school kids. “We suspect the iron bars that keep the concrete of the bridge together are sold at scrapyards,” said resident Johannes Mnisi (54). “We worked hard to get the bridge built so that our children can use it on their way to school. The sides now have big gaps and it is no longer safe for anyone to cross.” Meisie Msiza (37) told the SunTeam they will start patrolling the bridge at night. “Before we had the bridge, we couldn’t go to the neighbouring village and our kids couldn’t go to school. Now we’re going back to that situation. We won’t allow it.” She said they suspect nyaope smokers and the scrap collectors are the culprits. “Once the bridge breaks down completely it will take a long time for the municipality to fix it.” Ward Councillor James Msiza said razor wire will be installed on the sides to protect the bars. Thembisile Hani Local Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane said the technical department will be informed and further steps will be taken to make the bridge safe.
