SOWETO homes are not for sale! Frustrated residents fear they’ll lose their homes after people claim to have bought their houses but have no proof. The Soweto Concerned Community Movement’s Themba Maseko (37) said residents are tackling the issue together. “We went on an awareness walk in Joburg on Monday to spread the message that our family homes are not for sale. “We don’t understand it when strangers evict people who have lived here since the 60s,” he told Daily Sun. He said more and more people were losing their homes and depend on neighbours for shelter. Mpho Buthelezi told the SunTeam her home was bulldozed last Monday after a taxi owner claimed he bought the house from a makoti. “He came in April and claimed he bought the house but couldn’t produce any proof of ownership. “He came again in winter and broke the windows and doors. On Monday, he brought the whole house down. “Another house was brought down three years ago and nothing has been done in that yard.”
