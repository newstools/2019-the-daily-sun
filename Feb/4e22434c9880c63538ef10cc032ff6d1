UNDERTAKERS in and around Tshwane said they were fed up with the Odi Hospital administrators! They got into their hearses and drove to the hospital yesterday morning. They said they wanted management to fire a woman who worked for the mortuary admin. They claimed most of them lost business because of the woman. Piet Malatjie (64) of Two Brothers Funeral Parlour in Soshanguve said they had been having a problem with the mortuary admin for years. He said the woman spoke badly about local undertakers. “It seems she has a funeral parlour she supports and wants all the bodies to be taken there.” Piet said the woman often tells families other funeral parlours don’t have proper documents. Samuel Cossa, regional chairman of SAFF Undertakes Union, said they met the hospital CEO and management. “The hospital wasn’t aware of what was happening. But they promised to investigate the matter and get back to us.” Senior communication officer at Odi Hospital, Nombulelo Shangase said: “ The leadership from South African Funeral Forum enquired about the mortuary policy when collecting the corpse,” he said. She said a meeting was held and they will meet again.
