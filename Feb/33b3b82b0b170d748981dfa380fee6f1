THE Vlakfontein House of Horrors near Lenasia, south of Joburg, has been cleansed and is ready for a tenant. The house was in the news after seven people were killed and buried there. Family member Ningi Khoza told Daily Sun there were no ghosts in the house. She said they recovered the spirits of their loved ones and took them home to Pietermaritzburg, KZN. “We’ve cleansed the house with the help of Nazareth church members. “I slept there twice since the cleansing in December and came to fetch furniture last week and there was nothing wrong.” Ningi wasn’t sure they would get someone to rent but said whoever moves in can do their own rituals. She doesn’t think murder accused Ernest Mabaso died but he may have escaped.
