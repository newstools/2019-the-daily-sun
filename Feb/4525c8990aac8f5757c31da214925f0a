RESIDENTS are demanding proper toilets. Most houses have no toilets and in those that do, the toilets are damaged and pose a health risk. The residents of Kwa-Nonkobe Village in Mthatha said the last time they received toilets was 23 years ago when there was a cholera outbreak in the area. Village headman Msindise Mdemka (68) said all the zinc toilets were damaged. “We have been calling for government to intervene. This lack of toilets will cause another cholera outbreak,” he said. “We have been trying to get this sorted out with no success. We have held many meetings with our councillor and I even booked meetings with King Sabata Dalindyebo mayor Dumani Zozo, but nothing has happened.” OR Tambo municipal spokesman Ayongezwa Lungisa said there were plans to build toilets in the area but only in new houses. “There are new homes in that area, so we have plans to built infrastructure for them. We will start with the new households and then upgrade what is already built,” he said.
