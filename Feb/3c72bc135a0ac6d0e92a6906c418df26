A FORMER teacher has been bust filming women through a
secret two-way mirror he set up in his bathroom. According to New Zealand Herald, when cops bust him in
August last year they found 260 videos and 81 images of 90 women, with the
video footage lasting over 31 hours. Some of the images were taken as far back as 2013. The 52-year-old man, who cannot be named, apparently rented
out a room in his house to unsuspecting female tourists visiting his hometown
of Wellington in New Zealand. What they didn’t know was that he had installed a digital
camera in a hole in a bathroom wall, over which he had installed a two-way
mirror. He recorded females as young as 12 as they showered,
changed their clothes, or used the loo. He was finally bust when a 29-year-old woman staying in
his home heard a shuffling noise coming from the direction of the mirror while
she was brushing her teeth. She didn’t think much of it until the next day when she
discovered a sliding white board behind the mirror while she was cleaning. The
sliding board opened on to the garage. In a panic, she called the cops. Their search revealed
the digital camera and an external hard drive with the photos and hours of
intimate videos. There was no evidence the man distributed the intimate
footage to anyone else. The man pleaded guilty to the charges and will be sentenced
in June. Judge Peter Butler ordered that a psychiatrist examine
him and provide a report for the man's next appearance.
