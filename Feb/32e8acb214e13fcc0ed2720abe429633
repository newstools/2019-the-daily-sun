DJ EUPHONIK’S good deed has given many others hope! On 24 November, Solly Ramoshai (26) tweeted a picture of himself wearing his uniform on duty and wrote: “I’m not proud to be a guard but proud to have a job.” Euphonik, whose real name is Themba Nkosi, saw the tweet and responded to Solly: “Bhuti, please send your CV to the email in my bio. “Perhaps we can make you head of security at one of our buildings.    Your attitude is 1 00.” Two months later, Solly reported for duty! Solly, from Polokwane in Limpopo, told Daily Sun he did not think the picture would get that much attention when he posted it. “When Euphonik responded, I really thought it was a joke. He gave me a call and we began communicating.” Solly, who’s moved to Jozi and is working for Euphonik, said the DJ was open. He had only been a security guard for two years at Savannah Mall in Polokwane. “I want to become an electrical engineer and will start studying this year. “I’ve received a lot of encouragement. There’s no turning back.” Solly hoped his story would inspire many people. “We want our lives to go a certain way but don’t have control over things. But we do have control over how we rise.” He thanked Euphonik: “One day I’ll help others because of what he did for me.”
