THE Mtubatuba Municipality is once again at risk of being placed under administration. It was placed under administration in 2012 when it faced a R1,4 million lawsuit from a security company. ANC executive committee member Siya Khumalo said: “The opposition had to boycott or leave special meetings because the municipality’s management would tell us resolutions were taken but never discussed the matter with us. “The last time we had a council meeting was in November. We don’t know why meetings aren’t held anymore.” KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube said she was concerned about reports some decisions were made without meetings having been held. “Lots of allegations were made. The mayor’s car was abandoned because some suspected it was bewitched and possessed by tokoloshes,” said Dube-Ncube. She promised to address the issues. Municipal manager Jaconia Mngomezulu said the municipality had never implemented decisions without a council resolution. “As for the mayor’s car, its mileage reached 100 000km and the municipality sold it,” he said. “This was more affordable. The new car was budgeted for and we opted for a cheaper, reliable new vehicle.”
