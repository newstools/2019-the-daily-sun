NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality has finally fixed an uncovered storm drain that was making parents fearful for their kids’ lives. The People’s Paper first reported on the drain between NU1 and NU4 in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth last year. It’s believed the cover of the drain, which is about one metre deep, was stolen by people looking for scrap metal. Kids used to dice with death by hanging over the edge of the drain to watch the water flowing down inside. Resident Nomakhwezi Ngxongo (43) said: “We’re happy because now we are finally safe. We hope this won’t happen again.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said it cost about R600 to replace one cover. “Some covers have no metal content, which reduces the risk of theft. But we have also seen a decrease in the theft of these covers due to the increased visibility of the cops.”
