Blast from the past, Uyanda Mbuli has announced that she is making a TV comeback. But unfortunately, it is East African audiences who will get to witness the style star make her television return. The 41-year-old yummy mommy told fans on social media that she had landed herself a new gig that would see her bring her reality show to the small screen in the Eastern African region. "Humbled by this great opportunity to launch my TV show: UYANDA IT’S ON in #EastAfrica,” she said. Uyanda: It’s On is a reality show that launched in South Africa on SABC 3 in 2017 and caused a stir on social media for all of two weeks. The hype soon died out and even though the show did return for season two, there wasn't much hype then either.
