HANDS off our premier. Papa Penny must focus on his reality show and stop accosting the premier for VIP tags! These were the words of chairman of Limpopo Artists Movement, Mphoza Mashabela. Mphoza said he was angry with Papa Penny after he recently told Daily Sun he was being sidelined by the ANC in Limpopo, and that top members were jealous of his popularity. The People’s Paper published Papa Penny’s story, headlined: “Not Feeling The Love!” Mphoza said Papa Penny, whose real name is Eric Nkovani, must shut up and leave Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha alone. “No one is destroying his talent. “He is badly influencing other artists on Mathabatha,” he said. Mphoza said Papa Penny was supposed to talk to the provincial ANC officials and not run to the media to voice his anger.
