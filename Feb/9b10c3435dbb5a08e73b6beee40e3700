FRANCINA Ntuli and Sylvia Skhosana have accused Prophet Shepherd Bushiri of scamming them. Francina and Sylvia, from Mamelodi, Tshwane have accused the prophet of getting them to invest R100 000 each in a company called Rich Estates. The directors of the company are allegedly Bushiri’s right-hand men. The women claimed when they were members of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church in March 2017, Bushiri announced an investment opportunity. The women claimed they were promised a 50% return on their investment within a month, but they had to commit within days of the announcement. But two years later the women are still waiting for their money. Francina claimed Bushiri promised to meet them but never showed up and sent his delegates instead. She claimed they were invited to Sparkling Waters Hotel in Rustenburg, North West, but all they got were more excuses. Sylvia said she regrets being so trusting. “I took out a loan and now I’m struggling to pay it off,” she said. Bushiri’s spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said he doesn’t know anything about the scheme or the company. He said Bushiri had an investment company in Sandton, but it is not linked to the church. “With so many members at our church, it is easy for some to use that as an opportunity to scam people,” he said.
