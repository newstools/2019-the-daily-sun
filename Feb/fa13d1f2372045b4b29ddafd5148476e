KHAHLISO Modibedi never let her condition stop her from pursuing her dreams. The 33-year-old from Itemoheng Disabled Centre in Ficksburg, Free State, was born with albinism. “I grew up on a farm and would often get sick. “There was never any money, so I was adopted by the centre so I could get the treatment I needed,” she said. Despite the challenges ofliving with albinism, such as having poor eyesight, Khahliso’s mastered working with beads. She makes necklaces, earrings and bracelets to raise funds for the centre. “Life wasn’t always good for me. I come from a family of eight and two of my siblings are also living with albinism.” Khahliso said working with beads made her happy and was one of the ways she expressed herself. She said she was also a motivational speaker and helped others living with albinism.
