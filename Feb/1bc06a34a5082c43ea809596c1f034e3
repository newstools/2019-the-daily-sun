ANC NEC member Zizi Kodwa has blamed party infighting for the rape accusation against him. Over the weekend, allegations that Kodwa had raped a woman at his friend’s house surfaced, but he denied it. Kodwa said: “I refuse to bow down to dirty tricks by cowards operating from their factional dark corners, using a woman to fight or neutralise me. “I detest the use of such serious societal maladies like rape, sexual harassment and women abuse to simply achieve narrow factional and political ends.” ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said the party couldn’t do much to investigate the allegations and advised the woman to lay a criminal charge. The accusation against Kodwa comes days after ANC spokesman Pule Mabe was cleared of sexual harassment charges by the party. In a letter apparently written by the rape accuser, which has been circulating on social media, she said: “I had a really strange feeling about the sequence of events that happened. I discussed this with Papa Leshabane and we concluded a lot doesn’t make sense. “Papa did investigations and found some individuals were taking Rohypnol, a date rape drug whose symptoms I experienced.
