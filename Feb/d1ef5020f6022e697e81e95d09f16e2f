WHEN gogo Rebecca Jesi (60) joined the protest against the high cost of electricity and lack of jobs, she didn’t know she’d end up hurt. The incident happened when residents of Kocksoord, Finsbury, Peace Haven and Hillside in Randfontein, Mogale City, took to the streets on Saturday. When cops started firing rubber bullets at protesters, Rebecca was hit in the leg and fell to the ground, narrowly missing being trampled to death. Community leader Lebogang Short told Daily Sun: “There’s a massive project in ward 2, but local people have not benefitted. “All the work was given to outside contractors.” Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe said: “We’re ready to talk to the people. “More than 200 jobs were allocated for general work and local business people got contract jobs to build roads and sewers.” Randfontein police spokesman Brigadier Jacob Manamela told the People’s Paper cops were monitoring the situation and no arrests were made.
