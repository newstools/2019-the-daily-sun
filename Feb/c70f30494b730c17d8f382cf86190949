THE blood of a ram, a cross-like chain, oil and spiritual
perfumes … this was some of the powerful muthi a pastor allegedly used to defraud
a former church member of N59,7 million (about R2,2 million). According to Punch, Obinna Ezenwaka’s nightmare began is
2015 when he attended prophet Cletus Ilongwo’s church. Ilongwo’s is the Presiding
Pastor of the Power of the Holy Ghost Evangelical Ministry in Lagos, Nigeria. Ezenwaka testified in court this week, where Ilongwo is
facing 11 counts of fraud. He said: “Ilongwo gave me an appointment to see him,
because he wanted to know the reason why I came to the church. I told him that
some people owed me and they were not willing to pay and that I wanted him to
help me pray so that I could recover my money.” Ilongwo then told Ezenwaka to write the debtors’ names
our in magical sequences of seven, nine, 14 and 21, adding that “God would
answer my prayers and I would recover my money”. Ilongwo later took a more extreme step and told Ezenwaka
to bring a ram to his church. “The prophet killed the ram and used a bowl collect its
blood and persuaded me to bathe with the blood. After bathing, he gave me the
head of the ram and told me to follow him to a place in the church’s premises
where he dug the ground and buried the head of the ram with the names of my
debtors.”
