MAKANA Municipality has denied that its tap water is not safe to drink. This is after some social media users claimed the water was contaminated. Municipal spokeswoman Yoliswa Ramokolo said Makana’s tap water is safe for human consumption because several tests had been conducted to verify its quality. She said: “The municipality conducted several water tests in January to verify the quality. “The samples were collected and sent to the National Health Laboratory Services for microbiological analysis. “According to the National Health Laboratory Services report released in February, Riebeeck East failed only in terms of E-coli bacteria. “All the other areas were found safe for human consumption. “Due to large amounts of e-coli in Riebeeck East water, residents are requested to boil the water before they drink it. “The area is being monitored for water-borne diseases. The municipality is doing everything in its power to address this situation. “We are even sourcing independent specialist to do sampling in all our water treatment plants.”
