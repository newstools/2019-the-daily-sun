RESIDENTS are concerned about the ongoing killings in the taxi industry. This after taxi boss Bongani Mthembu (60) was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting near Magwaveni in Tongaat, north of Durban, on Friday. His killing follows the death of Nicholas Gumede (52), who was shot and killed in September. A taxi boss said Mthembu used his vehicles to transport pupils. “He met association members from time to time, but did not attend association meetings because he transported pupils,” said the taxi boss. A resident (19) said he and Mthembu were very close. “He was like a father to me. I’m still hurt and have no words to describe this loss,” said the resident. “Our kasi has lost a father and helper. He was down to earth and helped a lot of people in our neighbourhood. “He transported pupils and never fought with anyone. “These ongoing killings are concerning.” Daily Sun tried to get hold of the Mthembu family several times, but their phone rang unanswered. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened. “A 60-year-old man was driving his VW Polo when he was shot by suspects who were travelling in an unidentified vehicle. “He sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body and was declared dead at the scene,” said Gwala.
