A WARD councillor has promised to look into the problems faced by residents. This was after the community of Slenge in Pietermaritzburg, KZN took their service delivery frustration to the streets last week. The residents told Daily Sun they were not happy with the state of their pit toilets and also had electricity issues. One of the residents, Jabulani Mazibuko (42), said: “We lodged our complaints with the Msunduzi Municipality last year. We requested they consider building a sewage system after our ward councillor told us we were going to get more pit toilets.” He said the municipality sent a vehicle that came once and only cleaned a few toilets before it broke down. It never came back again. Another resident, Nomvula Yengwa (37), said they also encountered a problem with electricity. “Our stoves shock us even when the power is off,” said Nomvula. Councillor Sibongile Mncwango promised she was going to rework the toilet problem. “The toilet matter was resolved. I’m disappointed they didn’t report that the cleaning stopped,” she said. About the electricity issue, Mncwango said: “Electricians said the problem was caused by izinyoka. I’ve asked the municipality to handle the problem.” Acting municipal spokeswoman Ntobeko Ngcobo said: “The matter of the septic tank system is being addressed and we appeal for patience from residents. The municipality is experiencing a challenge in terms of illegal connections. The electricity unit is currently removing all illegal connections.”
