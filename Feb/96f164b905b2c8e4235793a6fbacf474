THULANI Baloyi is only 11, but she is already suffering because of problems with her ID. The grade 4 pupil, was chased away from school because she doesn’t have a birth certificate. Her first birth certificate said she was a boy. Her mum, Lindiwe Baloyi (32), had the error corrected, but the new birth certificate failed to show up on the school’s system. While her friends at Majakaneng Primary School in Majakaneng near Brits, North West, are at school the little girl sits at home. She said: “Her younger brother is allowed to stay in school while I’m anxiously waiting for his certificate for which I applied a few weeks ago.” Lindiwe says she submitted new documents at Home Affairs to issue a new certificate or correct the ID number. Daily Sun sent an email to Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola to help. Provincial education department spokesman Freddy Sepeng promised to speak to authorities. “A child must never be affected by a problem she has no control over,” he said.
