TWO occupants of a car were assaulted yesterday morning after the disappearance of a six-year-old boy living with albinism. The boy disappeared on Saturday night on his way from a spaza shop in Jerusalem squatter camp near Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. Residents turned the squatter camp upside down searching for him. When they couldn’t find him they blocked the entrances and stopped a car with two occupants. The men were beaten up by residents before cops took them to the police station for questioning. The child was found yesterday morning at a mine dump and reunited with his mum (29). He was taken to hospital, where he’s still receiving treatment. “His face was swollen and he had marks on his hands and feet. He told us he was tied up,” said his mum. “I cried and contacted my mother who called our pastor who prayed over the phone with her. They assured that the child would be safe. I’m pleased God heard our prayers.” She said she had quit her job to look after her son. A case of kidnapping was opened at Boksburg South Police Station. Cops are looking for more suspects.
