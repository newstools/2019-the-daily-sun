A DISABLED three-year-old girl’s mum said the eThekwini land invasion unit is heartless. The unit destroyed the shack of Mbali Shozi (32) from Umlazi last Monday. She said even though she told them she had a disabled child, they went ahead. She said they wouldn’t even allow her to remove her daughter’s Owani’s medication and food and she lost all her hospital documents. “I don’t know where to go with my child. Her life is in danger because she is exposed to the cold. “Although I rebuilt my shack, there are many holes and it gets wet when it rains,” she said. Mbali said Owani was born with a spinal problem and cannot walk or move. She said she is unemployed and depends on her child’s disability grant. Owani’s father dumped them last year. ANC national executive committee member Malusi Gigaba, KZN Human Settlements MEC Ravi Pillay and eThekwini Human Settlements head Mondli Mthembu visited the area on Saturday to campaign for next month’s by-election. Pillay and Mthembu promised to return soon to sort out the problem. Resident Mbali Fumba (33) said they didn’t know why their shacks were destroyed because they were given the land by their councillor. She said Councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo was supposed to bring them temporary permit letters but he was killed.
