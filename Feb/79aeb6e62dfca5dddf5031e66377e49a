STRONG winds that blew off the roof of a school building have forced pupils to learn under a tree. A teacher at Maledza Primary School in Nthlaveni block D, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, said they have reported the matter to the department of education several times, but nothing has been done. “It’s difficult to teach outisde because pupils can’t concentrate. “The situation gets worse when it rains as pupils don’t even bother coming to school.” According to the teacher, 10 classrooms were destroyed, leaving 200 pupils stranded. Only five classrooms were unaffected. The teacher is appealing to the government to help with mobile classrooms. Hlulani Chabalala (10), a grade 4 pupil, said: “I don’t like learning under a tree. I asked my parents to send me to another school, but they said they can’t afford it. We appeal to government to build us new classrooms.” Parent Rirhandzu Makondo (44) said they were worried about their children’s safety. “We’ve done our best to help the principal report the matter to the department, but they just send officials to inspect the building, followed by empty promises. “If only the school could be offered mobile classrooms.” Limpopo Education spokesman Sam Makondo said: “The department is aware of the situation at Maledza Primary. We’re doing an assessment on the condition of the school before we make a final decision.”
