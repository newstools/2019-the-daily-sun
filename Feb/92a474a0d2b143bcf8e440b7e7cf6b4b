ORLANDO Pirates have put their ambitions to win the Caf Champions League on ice to focus on the eagerly awaited Absa Premiership Soweto derby against rivals Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Pirates wasted a chance to stretch their lead at the top of Group B when they drew goalless with defending Caf champions Esperance at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. Although Bucs still head the standings, tied with the Tunisian giants on five points from three games, they’ve made it difficult for themselves ahead of the return leg scheduled for El Menzah next Tuesday. Guinea side Horoya are third with four points, while Zimbabwean outfit FC Platinum remain bottom on one point. Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic regrets that his charges failed to use home ground to their advantage. “We played well against a good team, but the important factor of scoring a goal was not there,” he said. “That denied us a chance to win. We regret why we didn’t use factors like our weather, supporters, our field that was in our favour here.” However, the Serbian born hopes his players will be wearing their scoring boots to appease their fans at the expense of Amakhosi on Saturday. Micho added: “Now we need to go back and plan for the derby against Chiefs and the return leg in Tunis, so we can deal with all the factors that could be in favour of the opponent. We need to calculate these things when we go there for the return leg.” Esperance coach Mouine Chaabani said: “It was a good game. My players came with a desire to get a good result. We found ourselves in a group with three teams with equal chance to proceed to the quarter-final. To be honest, it was not easy for us as we had played two games away where we had two draws and one victory in a cup. I am happy with our performance.”
