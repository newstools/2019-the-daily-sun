FOR weeks a female student in North Carolina, America
thought a ghost must be living in her flat. She would hear strange rattling sounds. Unexplained dirty
handprints appeared on a wall and a mirror. Clothes mysteriously went missing. Then last Saturday, the woman – known only as Maddie –
discovered what was really going on. A strange man had found a way to get in and out of her
flat, and spent time hiding in her cupboard – and wearing her clothes! According to news.com.au, Maddie told WHNT19 that her
feeling of being haunted started about a month ago when she heard "rattling
in my closet and I thought it was a raccoon". "Since I've been living here, I've had pieces of
clothes missing like shirts and pants," Maddie said. Finally last Saturday, Maddie couldn’t take it anymore
and decided she had to find out what’s going on in her wardrobe. Standing in front of it, she shouted: “Who’s in here?”. To her amazement, someone answered: “Oh, my name’s Drew.” Opening the door, Maddie was shocked to find a strange
man hiding in the tiny wardrobe, dressed in her clothes. The man turned out to be Andrew Clyde Swofford (30).
Lucky for Maddie, he may have been weird, but at least he wasn’t violent. Maddie said: “I told him, ‘You need to take my clothes
off', so he took my clothes off." He waited calmly as Maddie called the cops. Swofford appeared in court this week, facing 14 charges. Maddie, meanwhile, is completely freaked out and is
looking for a new place to live.
