PRECIOUS Masuku may be blind but it doesn’t hold her back because she is led by her spirit. She believes she was placed on the planet by God to encourage people not to give up. “What matters to me is my ability to think. My brain works as my eyes,” said the 21-year-old from Sterkspruit in the Eastern Cape. She said singing in her church’s youth choir cheered her up when she is sad. “Otherwise I’m always happy.” Precious likes acapella and hip hop and her favourite group is The Soil. She will record her gospel album soon and she hopes the group’s Ntsika Ngxanga will produce some of the songs. “Ntsika has the kasi soul,” she said. Precious said music takes her on a journey where she expresses her emotions.” Precious said it bothers her that some people still consider blind people to be abnormal. “Society needs to be educated. We have the right to be fully and equally involved in society.” As an independent person, Precious cooks and does her own shopping. Precious is a resident at the Joburg Society for the Blind. “I want to complete my matric. I want to study music, specialising in contemporary music.”
