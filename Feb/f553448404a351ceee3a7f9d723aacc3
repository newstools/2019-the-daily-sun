THOSE who travel by taxi know that whoever sits in the
front seat must have an ‘A Game’ when it to maths. The struggle for change in the taxi is real, especially
if you don’t know your maths well. TAXI maths often causes arguments in taxis as passengers
quarrel over change. Sometimes the arguments end up in fights. Last week, a video of two women fight over taxi maths
went viral on social media. Today another video involving a taxi maths fight, has
emerged on social media. But this time, there was no physical fight - just an
exchange of words. The man sitting on a front seat is having an argument
with one of the passengers. But what social media in stitches, is his use of language. Here are some of the things he says; The man tells the person he is arguing with that: Mina ngidineka
fast, quick, in a hurry (I get bored fast, quick, in a hurry). He then says: Wena une problem and iproblem yakho wuwe (You
have a problem and your problem is you) He continues: ubhuti une problem ngibone nge eye yakhe (This
brother has a problem I saw it through his eye). He then continue to say that he has never been a coward
and will not start being a coward “today”. “Ande ngiRilexile now…I’m done (I’m relaxed now and I’m
done).”
