GOOD work pays off! Yesterday, the City of Ekurhuleni honoured three people for their exceptional work and for inspiring others. Among those honoured was actress Connie Chiume, who was presented with an Excellence Award for her contribution to the arts. Connie said she was grateful to be honoured. “I am overwhelmed by the recognition and am happy to be recognised in my own community. It sometimes saddened me that I am relevant everywhere, but not in my home town,” she said. Soccer star Bernard Parker was also awarded an Excellence Award for his consistent and superb performance. The council also presented the first Lifetime Achievement Award to Nelson “Teenage” Dladla. Well-known for his creativity on the soccer pitch, Nelson is fondly remembered for his unmatched soccer skills. He continues to transfer knowledge as a coach at Mamelodi Sundowns’ junior structures. “At times legends don’t get the recognition they deserve. I am grateful to be honoured and glad the City of Ekurhuleni has started this programme,” he said. Council Speaker Patricia Kumalo thanked the kasi stars for setting a good example and said their stories were a testament that dreams come true through hard work.
