ZUKISWA Ngalo is living in fear that her two-roomed mud house will collapse and kill her family. The 56-year-old from Ngangelizwe in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, told Daily Sun the home she shared with her two sons and three grandchildren was full of holes and leaked whenever it rained. She said she applied for an RDP house in 2017 before she was left bedridden by a stroke. Zukiswa said she survived on her children’s social grants, but the most humiliating thing is not having a toilet or electricity in her home. “I have thought about going to a care home, but I can’t leave my children alone. I don’t even know where my grandchildren’s mothers are. I would be risking their lives,” she said. Zukiswa said her son Thamsanqa (20) dropped out of school in grade 11 to look after her. He wanted to go to school but couldn’t leave Zukiswa alone as she sometimes fell out of bed. “I decided it would be best if I looked after her so I could know she was safe,” he said. Zukiswa said on top of everything, she had run out of her medication as she didn’t have transport money to get to the local clinic. King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said they were not aware of Zukiswa’s situation. He said he would refer the matter to municipal authorities. “The matter must be looked at to find a solution to address the conditions the woman is living under,” he said. He said although he couldn’t be certain about how long it would take, he would make sure the matter was attended to urgently. Provincial health department spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said that they will organise a pickup point for Zukiswa’s medication.
