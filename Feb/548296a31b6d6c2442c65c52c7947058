TWO people had to be rushed to hospital on Friday after being caught in a shoot-out. A bystander and a security guard were shot when cops pounced on a group of men suspected of robbing a cash in transit vehicle. Police were driving down Old Joburg Road in Sebenza, Ekurhuleni, when they spotted men suspected of robbing an unmarked Toyota Hilux SUV belonging to a cash in transit company. They chased the suspects and cornered them on Byron Street, near Lombardy East. A shoot-out resulted, but cops managed to arrest all the seven suspects. Police said they seized three R5 rifles, one AK47, one 9mm pistol and live ammunition. Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said a BMW X5, a BMW sedan, a VW Polo and a Toyota Yaris were also seized. “A Mercedes-Benz was also recovered in Sebenza which was believed to have been used in the robbery. “It was reported stolen in Pretoria Central,” she said. Peters told Daily Sun the investigation will be taken over by the Hawks.
