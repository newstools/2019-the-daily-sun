 Shocking mismanagement at Tshilidzini Hospital has prompted Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba to remove the facility's entire management team. The hospital, which is based in Vhembe, serves a large community. Health e-News reports that problems at the hospital include dilapidated buildings, poor service and long queues of people who wait for hours, only to be sent home without receiving help. It is believed that the health institution's troubles are the result of poor management. When Ramathuba visited the hospital recently, several patients complained. Some told her that they waited for hours but that no one was willing to assist. Ramathuba said she was worried about the negative reports the hospital had been receiving and that a turnaround strategy was needed to restore public confidence. "As I listened to certain categories of workers I am convinced that the hospital lacks a proper management system. The hospital is in dire need of leadership that will inspire workers to do more for the patients, given limited resources. We need to find ways of including Tshilidzini in our revitalisation programme," said Ramathuba.
