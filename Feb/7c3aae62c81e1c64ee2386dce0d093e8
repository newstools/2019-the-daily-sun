ILLEGAL colleges in Rustenburg, North West, were shut down earlier this month. The municipality and higher education and training department said the colleges did not comply with the required standards. Roseville FET College was one of them. When the SunTeam visited the college on Wednesday and pretended to be students, they were told registrations were open and given pamphlets showing courses and costs. On Friday, when the facility was shut down, management claimed they were in the process of compiling documentation and had not started operating. Municipal spokesman David Magae said they were not aware the college was operating. He said the public safety department would be sent to enforce by-laws and determine the next step. Kgosi Monageng from the department said they were not aware the college had reopened. “We will involve the cops,” Monageng told Daily Sun.
