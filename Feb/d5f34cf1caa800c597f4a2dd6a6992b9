A video of man a who managed to stop thieves from stealing his
bakkie has surfaced on social media. The bakkie owner stopped the thugs just as they were
reversing from a parking lot at a shopping centre. In a video, a grey Renault Clio can be seen parking next to
the bakkie and one of the thugs getting out in the passengerâ€™s door. He then fiddles with the bakkie door handle, and manages to
open it. As he tries to reverse from the parking lot, a man is seen
running towards the bakkie and the tsotsi quickly gets out of the bakkie. Following that the tsotsi rushes into the grey Clio and
they drive away leaving the bakkie behind. The incident reportedly occurred at a shopping centre in Casseldale
in Springs on Saturday.
