AMARANTH leaves, known as imbuya in Zulu, are perceived as food for the poor. But according to two University of Zululand lecturers, creating products using these leaves would not only ensure food security in Mzansi but it would also provide people with lots of protein. Dr Melusi Sibanda and Professor Unathi Kolanisi started a project in 2016 to promote products made from the leaves. They said the leaves were health herbs found all over Mzansi. Kolanisi said this was their way of promoting indigenous food. “We are trying to infuse the old with the modern. Most people don’t like these nutritious leaves because they are mostly cooked the old way. “So we thought why not make them in the way that will make people beg for more.” Sibanda said they make muffins, bread, biscuits, pesto, rusks and cake with the leaves. She said they realised people love food which is bad for their health. “We are providing them with what they love in a healthy way. “We replaced all the bad ingredients with the health herb,” he said. Sibanda said they were still working on getting their products in stores. He said they had created job opportunities for three traders. “We have an agreement with them to supply us with the leaves. “The good thing is the plant is everywhere and it will be here for many more years to come. We want people to stop this perception that amaranth leaves are for the poor.”
