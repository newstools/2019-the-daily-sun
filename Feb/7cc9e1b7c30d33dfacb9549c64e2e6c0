LAST year, he allegedly raped a woman and managed to get away from the cops. But on Sunday, the thug’s luck ran out when he was bust after his footprints led the cops right to him! Police spokeswoman Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said a burglary took place in Phahameng kasi, near Welkom in the Free State. “During the burglary, a TV, a DStv decoder and a blanket were stolen.Two members were assigned the burglary docket on Sunday afternoon. “Constable Jurie Botes and Constable Joyce Tau visited the scene and the occupants of the house were not there. Botes noticed the shoe prints outside the house. “He contacted K9 unit for assistance and they lifted the shoe printsto identify them as Salomon sneakers. The prints led them to a house near the crime scene. The suspect (30) was identified and brought in for questioning.” Mokhuoane said the investigation led the two members to a house in Bronville where the TV had been sold. The DStv decoder was found in the grass. The 30-year-old suspect was arrested and while processing him, Botes noticed the suspect was also wanted in connection with a rape that took place in Thabong late last year. Mokhuoane said the suspect would appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court soon.
