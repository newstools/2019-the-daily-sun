TRAFFIC built up in the Tshwane CBD on Saturday morning after a big tree fell down, blocked the road and broke power cables. Tshwane Emergency Management Service spokesman Johan Pieterse said the rain that fell non-stop in the past week softened the soil so much that it could no longer hold up the weight of the tree. The tree fell over at the corner of Pretorius and Johan streets in Arcadia, causing a traffic jam. “There was some traffic problems and spectator value during the incident but no injuries,” he said. Snapped electrical cables and the tree were left lying in the road. Pieterse said many trees were in danger of falling over because of the rain.
