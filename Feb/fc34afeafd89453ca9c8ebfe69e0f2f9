MARGARETTE Baloyi has been having sleepless nights since her son, Thapelo, disappeared. The 59-year-old from block DD in Soshanguve, Tshwane, said Thapelo was last seen in December. Margarette said the last time she saw her 39-year-old son was when he went out one morning to visit a friend. “He didn’t come back home that day. We thought he would return later, but didn’t,” she said. Margarette told Daily Sun she and her family looked everywhere for Thapelo, but with no luck. “We went to his friend’s place, hospitals and mortuaries, but there was no sign of him. “My world has been shattered. I love my son so much,” she said. Margarette said since Thapelo went missing, she had been unable to sleep or eat. She said it was confusing as he had no enemies. “I can’t see how he could have been killed somewhere because he was a humble person who wouldn’t even hurt a fly. “Everyone loved him and he got along with many people in the area,” she said. “My last hope is SunReaders. We’ve seen other people get help from the People’s Paper and we hope we will also be assisted.” Rietgat police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleka confirmed a missing person’s case was opened. Anyone with information should call their nearest police station.
