SuperSport United winger George Lebese says clubs should not promise players game-time before signing them and then fail to deliver once they arrive. The 30-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs star joined Mamelodi Sundowns from the Soweto Giants a few seasons ago, but his time at Chloorkop did not go as well as he had anticipated. Lebese struggled to break into the Downs team during his time at the Tshwane-based outfit, eventually forcing a move to neighbours SuperSport on loan. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane has come under fire in recent weeks for signing players and then failing to give them game time. Another former Downs player who was short of game time, Toni Silva, launched a scathing attack on Mosimane through a letter, saying he “destroys careers.” ICYMI: SILVA: 'PITSO DESTROYS CAREERS' Mosimane has responded to the allegation, saying he can’t bench players who perform consistently for those who do not. However, Lebese, who was mentioned in the letter written by Silva, has also opened up regarding the issue on social media. A fan asked the star who he expected to be benched in order for him to play at Downs. “Ok fair enough, no one, guys are doing well but also don’t call us when we at our teams playing and performing lying to us about how we going to play then,” Lebese replied. He also added that the bench was not the real reason he left Chiefs for Downs, although he did not elaborate on the real reason behind his departure. “I’m not hating either just stating facts, then again the bench was not the reason I left, but anyway thanks my brother,” he told another fan .
