RESIDENTS are pleading with the Ekurhuleni Municipality to improve the condition of South Park Cemetery in Germiston. Not only have residents complained about the graveyard being overgrown, they also said it had become a haven for nyaope addicts. Lerato Masilela (33) from Makawusi in Ekurhuleni said she hadn’t visited her mother’s grave for a year. “The place is too creepy. It’s futile to clean my mum’s grave because the graveyard looks like bush. It’s scary,” said Lerato. Zodwa Dlamini (37) said they were concerned about the dignity of their lost loved ones. “How can they rest in peace while nyaope addicts make a place of rest their home?” She said she had complained to the municipality but nothing was done. Sipho Ngwena (49) from Primrose in Ekurhuleni said if he could, he would close the cemetery until the municipality cleaned it. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said: “We experienced week-long rainfall from 11 February. We were not able to cut the grass until the 18th. The second mowing in February is 50% done. Hopefully, the cemetery will be clean by 1 March. In a nutshell, we are aware of the current status.”
