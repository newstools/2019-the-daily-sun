THEIR legs may be a bit rusty but when they had to be back on the field, they delivered. On Saturday, retired soccer players from Strand showed youths what they could do with the ball at a mini soccer tournament at Lwandle Sports Complex in Strand, near Cape Town. Four teams took part and the players tried to show off what they used to do back in the day. The final was played in the evening between Indwe FC and Strand FC, which Indwe won. With legs worse for wear, the players missed the ball and cramps made them fall easily. Masande Skelenge, who used to hold the midfield during his playing days, said: “It was a great experience playing against the people I used to play with and see they are still in good shape. We enjoyed ourselves and would like to encourage healthy living.” Indwe’s Sandile Bavuma said: “This gave us the opportunity to pass our experience on to the youth. “Our legs are not as quick as they used to be. It was fun and I would do it again.” Local league association chairman Mzukisi Madondile said they can start a league for seniors. “We must give youth a chance.”
