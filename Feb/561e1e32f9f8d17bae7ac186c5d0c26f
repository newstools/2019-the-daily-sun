Two pupils involved in a scuffle at a Centurion school have been placed on precautionary suspension. This is after a video of an altercation between a schoolboy and a schoolgirl was shared on social media. In the video the boy, dressed in grey pants and blue jersey, is seen hitting the girl. He then throws her to the ground. Other pupils attempt to separate the two as the boy continues to hit the girl as she lies on the ground. According to the Gauteng education department, the scuffle occurred on Friday, February 15, during a lunch break at Lyttleton Manor High School. "Both parents of the implicated learners were called to the school to discuss the disciplinary processes. Preliminary investigations revealed that it was the girl learner who instigated the fight by attacking the boy learner, who retaliated as a result, as seen on the video," education spokesperson Steve Mabona said. He said a psychosocial team was dispatched to the school for necessary support to all who were affected by the incident. Provincial education MEC Panyaza Lesufi condemned the incident, saying such behaviour would not be tolerated in schools. "Ill-discipline will never be allowed to persist in our schooling environment," he said. "We urge all our learners to refrain from acts of misconduct in schools and implore parents to assist the department in instilling learner discipline in and outside the school environment," said Lesufi. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/2-pupils-at-centurion-school-suspended-after-brutal-fight-20190219
