SOLOMON Ashoms said his words of caution to Prophet Shepherd Bushiri fell on deaf ears. Solomon, from the Movement Against Abuse in Church, said Bushiri offered him a media job in 2015 but when he went for a meeting he wasn’t impressed. Ashoms said everything Bushiri did in church was an act. “The media team edited footage to make it look as if he had powers. They edited a clip to make it look like he walked on air,” he said. “I told Bushiri his conduct was not right. But he helped me understand false prophets exist and how they operate.” Last week a video of Bushiri apparently making a prophecy that he would be prosecuted started circulating. The video was apparently made before the stampede at his church that left three people dead.
