A CHILD told the East London High Court on Friday her mum forced her to falsely accuse her uncle of rape. The court acquitted the man (29) yesterday after the seven-year-old from a village near East London became confused while testifying and confessed. The alleged rape happened almost two years ago when the child was only five. Her uncle had been in custody since then. The child told the court: “When I lie, mama gives me sweets. But when Itell the truth, mama beats me up.” Clinical psychologist Karen Andrews told the court: “The child was unable to tell the difference between lies and truth.” The child’s mum (34) told the court the girl had told her that her uncle took her to bed and inserted a black thing into her private parts. “I confronted my brother and asked why he had raped my child. “He denied it and hit me with a garden spade,” she said. The mum admitted in court she drank heavily and often left the child alone in their one-roomed shack. The child spent most of her time with her uncle. Prosecutor Sibusiso Mgenge said the conditions under which the child lived came to light during cross-examination. The judge dismissed the child’s evidence as unreliable and the charges against the uncle were dropped.
