MPUMALANGA Community Safety MEC Pat Ngomane has warned 50 young people who received drivers’ licences on Friday not to lend them to their partners or relatives. He was speaking during the licence handover ceremony held at Nutting House Lodge outside Mbombela. Through the department’s young capacity project, 738 young people from across the province received licences. The programme was launched in July 2016 by the department and Services Seta to help poor pupils from across the province get licences. A total of R49 million was injected into the project. Ngomane said all the recipients were taught what it meant to have a licence. “These licences are yours. Don’t lend them to anyone because it is yours only. Even if you are married in community of property, there are exceptions that you cannot share. “Let us benefit from what you’ve learnt and ensure all road users, including pedestrians, are safe.” Ngomane said the department is willing to expand the project to develop young disadvantaged people in the province. Services Seta CEO Amanda Buzo-Gqoboka said it was a special project, as they usually focus on skills development. Beneficiary Solomon Shabangu (22) from Phola told Daily Sun he wouldn’t have been able to get his licence without the training. “I am grateful as it will help me in the future,” Solomon said.
