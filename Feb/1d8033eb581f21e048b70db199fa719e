MILUTIN “Micho” Sredojevic better find solutions than excuses for Orlando Pirates to prevail in the Caf Champions League. The Buccaneers have dropped to third with five points in group B, having lost 2-0 to Esperance in Tunis on Tuesday. But the Bucs coach would do well to find solutions and turn the campaign around to secure his side a spot in the quarter-finals with the two remaining matches. Horoya moved to second with seven points, leaving Pirates with an unenviable task of overcoming them in Conakry, and see off bottom-placed Platinum FC to progress in the tournament. To this end, though, Micho will have to forget about excuses and plot a way past the Guineans when Bucs travel to Conakry for their last match on 16 March. While they showed great effort in the first leg, the Soweto giants were outwitted by a sleek Esperance, who didn’t need their vociferous supporters to urge them at the near-empty El Menzah Stadium. “After a really tough match on Saturday, we came here looking to recover mentally and physically and I’d say we did everything to recover,” said Micho. Esperance are top of the group with eight points. They just need win to seal their place in the quarter-finals. “For us, we did not lose the match but learnt a lesson on how, in tough conditions away from home, you are supposed to look for a much better performance and result,” added Micho. “We need now to be strong enough and show character going to the last two matches in the group stages against FC Platinum and Horoya with determination to qualify for the quarterfinals.”
