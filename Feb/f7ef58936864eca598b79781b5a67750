IT’S the conference all Mzansi men have been looking forward to since the year started. #MensConference will take place today. Although it’s a Twitter event, men from all over the country will attend the conference. Some of the issues suggested for the agenda are femicide and the rate of suicide among men. The conference will also be attended by celebrities, with rapper Kwesta confirming he would speak at the gathering. Yesterday, men set the ground rules and discussed the final items which will be on the agenda at the conference. @sbudamusic said: “#MensConference, when you get there, please don’t forget to tell fellow brothers to stop abusing, raping and killing women and children. Enjoy.”
