ANDRIES Khoza (56) spends hours sweeping and maintaining the passageway next to his house. And when he saw his neighbour’s son peeing there, he asked him to stop. But he got the shock of his life when he and his family were moered instead of getting an apology! Andries from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he was assaulted by more than 12 men on Monday. He said he was walking his partner Akhona Nabi home when he saw a neighbour’s son peeing. He said they followed the boy to his house to demand an apology but were met at the gate by a group of men armed with knobkerries, spears, pitchforks and spades. Andries said the neighbour demanded to know what had happened and he was hit on the head with a spear. He said the neighbour tried to hit him with a spade but he blocked the blow. He said when Akhona, who is pregnant, tried to intervene the men started beating her. Andries’ son tried to help but he was also moered. The three fled to their own yard but the mob allegedly threw rocks at them. Andries said his car was damaged during the chaos. He said it was not the first time they had fought over the passage. “He’d complain about delivery cars parking outside the gate and I’d wonder what his issue was as his gate doesn’t even face the passage,” he said. Police spokeswoman Captain Buyisile Mvelase said a case of assault was opened but no arrests were made.
