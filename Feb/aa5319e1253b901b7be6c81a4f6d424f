ELDERLY people in Regorogile, Thabazimbi, received food parcels. Waterberg mayor Morris Mataboge used his birthday as an opportunity to celebrate the elderly in the area. Mataboge said he could not receive gifts while there were gogos and madalas who went to bed on an empty stomach. “We are nothing without pensioners on our side,” he said. Mataboge called on the youth to take care of senior citizens. “It worries us a lot that there are pensioners who are being abused by their children. “Violence against senior citizens must come to an end. “Elderly people need respect and love so they can live longer. “Because the government also belongs to the elderly, we are going to ensure we protect, love and support them. “Pensioners should be recognised for uniting the country.” Mataboge also urged Mzansi’s senior citizens to show the youth the path to success. “We need to learn from our parents while they are still with us,” he said. Itsoseng Batsofe NGO secretary, Cathrine Nkhumise, said a great leader thinks and cares for his parents. “It takes a village to raise a child and we are proud to reap what we have sown,” said Nkhumise. “This kind of support for the elderly should be an inspiration to the youth.”
