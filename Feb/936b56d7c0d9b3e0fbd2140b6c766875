ON SATURDAY, Samwu Vhembe leaders Ronald Mani and Timmy Musetsho were buried at Mbaleni Cemetery, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo. Musetsho (48) from Makwarela was shot at home in Polokwane last month while Mani (50) was ambushed two weeks ago at Itsani, outside Thohoyandou. People said the two were targeted for their outspoken views about the looting at VBS and corruption at Vhembe Municipality. Makhuvha Stadium outside Thohoyandou was almost filled to capacity by the Vhembe comrades’ family and colleagues, residents, government officials, members of the tripartite alliance and the Vhembe Pastors’ Forum, which worked closely with the dead men. ANC Vhembe members were noticeably absent. On Friday a memorial service was held at the stadium for the two. During the funeral, speaker after speaker said there will be rolling mass action in Vhembe if cops don’t arrest their murderers. New Vhembe mayor Mavhungu Lerule was given a list of demands. Cosatu first deputy president Mike Shingange said Vhembe workers won’t go back to work until their demands were met. “We are defending ourselves and avenging our fallen comrades, who died for demanding the removal of two councillors implicated in the VBS scandal. You know them.” Limpopo ANC secretary Soviet Lekganyane said cops working with thugs will be dealt with, and SACP second general secretary Solly Mapaila gave the police two weeks to bust the killers.
