“This Ministry would be remiss to fail to note how Mama Dorothy was the quintessential African, completely at ease in her articulation of the languages of Africa and her sons and daughters.” These are the words of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation minister Nathi Mthethwa. Mthethwa penned a tribute to the fallen musical legend Dorothy Masuka after she passed away over the weekend. He described Dorothy as a great Baobab tree. “At this stage, words truly fail, as Mama Masuska’s death reverberates throughout the country and continent as would when a great Baobab tree falls, it leaves a trail of destruction in its fall,” Mthethwa said. “In our case, that of broken hearts, as hers was one of the most extraordinary of all lives; a legacy of immeasurable proportions.” Mthethwa quoted mama Dorothy, who said:” If you stop me from singing I will die. Ngingafa nya. If you tell me, ‘Dorothy, here’s triple billions, stop singing’- I will refuse. Because you are stopping me from breathing. I didn’t want to sing, music wanted me to do it, yinto ephakathi egazini kimi le (this thing is in my blood).” “With Mama Dorothy’s words in mind, how do we not but marvel at the fulfilling of the words she articulated with her own mouth, that of never ever wishing to stop singing…until the day she dies? “Indeed, that is what she did, because the only interruption to her singing was that of her taking ill and finally taking her final breath.”
