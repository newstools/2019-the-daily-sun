AS IF their dirty transit camp isn’t bad enough, now the KwaMancinza residents’ toilets are falling apart. The gatvol people north of Durban said they want their councillor to urgently move them from the camp as they can’t take it anymore. They said the basins and showers are broken, they often run out of water and pipes are blocked. Kak spills everywhere and there is an unbearable smell. One of the residents told Daily Sun it seems the councillor has forgotten about them because they’ve been living in the camp for seven years. “We lost our houses during the heavy rain in 2012. The councillor organised a transit camp for us while we are waiting for RDPs.” She said the camp is now are falling apart. “The toilets are a nightmare for us but we use them anyway. “There are 16 of us in the family so it’s impossible to bath here. We don’t have a choice but to use these terrible toilets.” Another resident said they want their councillor to do something quickly. “No one can live under such terrible conditions. Our kids often get sick. Most people here have TB.” Councillor Simon Khuboni said he hasn’t forgotten about the people in the transit camp. “I will meet and update them on what I’ve been doing for them to get RDPs,” he said.
