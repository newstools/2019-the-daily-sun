A WEEK ago Mzansi was slamming Moruti Gucci. But businessman Malcolm X has defended him. Moruti Gucci made headlines after pictures and videos of him showing off his Gucci clothes went viral. He was mocked on social media, with some claiming his clothes were fake. Others made fun of his bedroom and said he should be focusing on building a bigger house instead of a bigger Gucci collection. But while Mzansi made fun of Moruti Gucci, Malcolm X met him for lunch in Sandton. Malcolm X said he loved to help those who were looked down on. “I will fight for Moruti Gucci when everyone else is against him. I align myself with those that others look down on,” he said. He said Moruti Gucci was an intelligent man. “He came to Joburg to hustle. He loves having fun and wearing nice clothes, and he hates debt,” he said. Social media users were confused when they saw pictures and videos of the two on a lunch date. Malcolm X said all of Moruti Gucci’s clothes were the real deal.
