TRAFFIC came to a standstill on the N2 between Umgababa and the Umkomaas River yesterday morning. Angry residents blockaded the busy highway with burning tyres, demanding that their gravel road should be fixed. People going to work in the Durban and Isipingo industrial area were delayed for hours. Residents refused to move even when Councillor Bheki Thabethe and other local leaders addressed them. Thabethe said he had been aware of the road problem since he became councillor in 2016. He said the protest organisers were not aware that their problem had already been addressed. He said a contractor had been appointed to fix the road and would start next month. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cops dispersed the crowd. No damage was reported.
