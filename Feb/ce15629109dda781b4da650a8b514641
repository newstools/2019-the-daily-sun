THUGS have tried many times to break into Eric’s house, but his dogs always stop them. But on Tuesday they used the cruelest trick of them all to steal his cars – they poisoned two dogs! Eric Khoza (51) from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, opened the kitchen door on Tuesday morning and saw his two dogs lying on the stoep, dead. The three thugs, who were hiding in the garage, jumped out and held him up at gunpoint. They demanded he give them gold. Eric, who works at a mine, told them he didn’t have any and they ransacked the house. “One of them even climbed up the ceiling to search for it,” Eric said. They took his Toyota Hilux bakkie, his Fortuner, a plasma TV, R3 000 in cash and cellphones. Eric was still traumatised when Daily Sun spoke to him. He suspected the evil thugs were sent by someone. “I don’t have gold. I’m just a regular guy. My dogs were very good. Uninvited people wouldn’t come into the yard.” Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said burglary and theft cases were opened. He appealed to anyone with information to visit the Etwatwa cop shop or call 08600 10111.
