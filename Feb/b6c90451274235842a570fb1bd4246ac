A VOLKSWAGEN Citi Golf spun for the last time when it knocked over a pedestrian. Police left no stone unturned in their search for the driver of a white City Golf 1 after a video of the incident went viral. The car and its owner were found in Vlakfontein, south of Joburg. When questioned by the police the owner claimed he was not the one driving the car on the day of the accident. But Joburg Metro police spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said in terms of the National Road Traffic Act, the owner could be held liable and charged with reckless and negligent driving. “The owner will have to say who was driving the car.” Minnaar said the person who was driving could face a culpable homicide charge if the pedestrian in the video died. “But if that person is not found, the owner will face the charge. “We also want the person who took the video to come forward and give a statement regarding the incident.”
