FORMER top cop Vincent Mdunge wants his five-year sentence reduced. Mdunge, who was a senior superintendent and KZN police spokesman, appeared in the Durban Magistrates Court yesterday. He told the court he wanted his prison sentence changed to correctional supervision so he could perform public duties. Prosecutor Desiree Boyang asked for a postponement because she said the state had just received Mdunge’s application letter. Magistrate Sophie Reddy said Mdunge’s document was misplaced by a clerk and postponed the case to Thursday. “The state will go through the docket and his application and decide if his request will be considered. We will also hear next week whether the matter will be opposed or not,” said Reddy. Mdunge was convicted of fraud and forgery in 2014 and was sentenced to five years in jail in 2015. He appealed his sentence and lost in the Supreme Court of Appeal. He began serving his sentence in August 2017. Mdunge presented a fake matric certificate to secure a job as a cop in 1987, which allowed him to get promotions and gained him entry to Unisa. He was convicted on one charge of fraud for receiving a salary to which he was not entitled and another for a forged matric certificate.
