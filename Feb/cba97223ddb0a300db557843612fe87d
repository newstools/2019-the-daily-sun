MEMBERS of the Young Communist League have demanded that student debt be scrapped. Classes at the Tshwane University of Technology were suspended after students marched on Wednesday. They marched from Burgers Park to the department of higher education and training offices to deliver a memorandum of demands. They wanted government to speed up the process of free education. “The scrapping of historical debt for poor and working-class students will provide much-needed financial relief,” said the league’s district secretary, Kgabo Morifi. District member Thato Monene said they wanted assistance for students who didn’t have accommodation. “We can’t have students struggling with accommodation, especially those who come from poor families, when the government can help.” Director-general Felix Qonde accepted the memorandum on behalf of Minister Naledi Pandor. Qonde said they would respond to it by Friday. Thato said after the department had responded, no students should struggle because of a lack of funds. “If they don’t respond, they should expect a national shutdown in the next coming weeks,” he told the People’s Paper.
