Gauteng Premier David Makhura will deliver his last State of the Province Address (SOPA) during the official opening of the Legislature on Monday. The SOPA will take place at the Alberton Civic Centre. On Sunday, the ANC in Gauteng released an open letter addressed for President Cyril Ramaphosa, regarding what they called the elephant in the room, referring to the ‘E-Tolls'. “We were particularly pleased when during your address you paid specific attention to the impact the cost of living is having on the poor and working class citizens. Highlighting some of the measures your government will put in place to mitigate these comes as a huge relief to many living in Gauteng,” the statement read. It stated that the ANC in Gauteng, together with its Alliance partners, various civil society formations and residents from all walks of life, took part in the People’s March and they delivered a very clear message to his office on behalf of the people of the Gauteng Province. “Lastly, we categorically stated that the impact of the VAT increase and the urban tolling system in our province has negatively affected those who travel in order to make ends meet or to make their contribution towards the growth of our country. The aggregate impact of all the above is that costs are passed on to the middle strata, the working class and the poor, thus eroding their standard of living,” ANC Gauteng Province Provincial Secretary  Jacob Khawe said. In 2018 January Makhura admitted that e-tolling had not worked and that he would meet with President Cyril Ramaphosa to devise an alternative funding model. He said on his previous SOPA that he would will engage with President Ramaphosa in order to find a new and more equitable funding model to support the continued expansion of Gauteng's road network and public transport system.
