RESIDENTS were shocked when they heard about the rape of a 98-year-old gogo – allegedly by her two great-grandsons, aged 15 and 19. A resident, Mathabang Molaoa (56), of Tebang section of Makwane Village in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State said the two boys should consider themselves lucky to have been found by police before the community got to them. Police spokesman Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said the older boy handed himself over to the police on Monday after a case was opened by relatives on Saturday. The rape is believed to have happened on 18 December. Mophiring told Daily Sun: “The case was reported by the gogo’s great-grandchildren and the two suspects’ mothers.” He said the older suspect took the police to a place where the younger one was caught. The 15-year-old suspect appeared in the Makwane Magistrates Court on Tuesday and his case was postponed until 5 March for a formal bail application. He is detained at a juvenile centre. The older suspect appeared in the same court yesterday. His case was postponed to 7 March for bail application.
