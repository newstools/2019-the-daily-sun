THESE residents have no peace when it rains and said they needed stormwater drains to prevent flooding in their yards. Maphotla villagers near Siyabuswa in Mpumalanga said they have been asking the municipality for help for many years to build a stormwater drain but their pleas fell on deaf ears. They told Daily Sun they invited the ward councillor many times to see the problem but he never came. Resident Thomas Lepoto (57) said: “We told the councillor we were struggling because of the rain water and he said we should dig a trench. “The street is flooded when it rains and we don’t have time to dig a trench as we work. He doesn’t even want to see our problem. “Recently, he promised to bring a grader to dig trenches but it never happened.” Thomas said they could not even get out of their yards because of the water. “It takes weeks before the water dries out,” he said. David Baloyi (49) said he tried to stop the water with sacks full of sand but it did not work. “When the water rushes by, it washes the sacks away. It erodes my yard and I’ve tried everything to prevent it. The municipality does not seem to care about us. “We have been crying for many years but nothing happens,” he said. Dr JS Moroka municipal spokeswoman Masabatha Ramatsetse said there was no stormwater project for the ward this year but the municipality would help people channel the water from their yards into streams to avoid flooding.
