 An 81-year-old woman burnt to death in her home in Needs Camp, East London, police said. The elderly woman lived alone in an area where new RDP houses had been built. According to police, neighbours saw the victim's house in flames in the early hours of Monday. "The neighbours called one another and tried to extinguish the flames but all was in vain," said police spokesperson Captain Hazel Mqala.
