THERE have been mysterious killings since December last year and villagers don’t know why they are being targeted. Parents in Maqeleni Village, Eshowe, KZN have moved their sons to places of safety following attacks on some young men. A man aged 25 was attacked and killed a week ago at his home. This follows four earlier attacks, when two men were attacked in their home. A parent whose son was killed said the killings started on 22 December when a 28-year-old young man was shot. “We have decided to move all our sons to a place of safety because we don’t know why they are being attacked. Cops are not making any arrests. They should be visible so that we feel safe,” he said. A 27-year-old man said his father had nowhere to take him so he’s still in the village. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed two cases of murder and two cases of attempted murder are being investigated by Eshowe cops. “A man was shot dead on 21 December. On 4 January, an unknown suspect entered a house in Maqeleni. The suspect allegedly opened fire, wounding two boys. “Four counts of attempted murder were opened. A case of murder was opened after a 25-year- old man was shot dead on 18 January. No arrests have been made,” said Zwane.
