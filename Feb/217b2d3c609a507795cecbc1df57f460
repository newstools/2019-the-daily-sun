FANI Sekhwela (54) is angry after the municipality allegedly demolished his four-roomed house in 2010! And he claimed he was not warned his house would be reduced to ruins. Fani from Marokolong in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, said: “I lost about R120 000 worth of furniture at the hands of municipal officials.” Fani said he inherited the land from his late parents and wanted to keep it for future generations. He said the municipality replaced his house with a one-roomed shack. “I became very weak after the incident. I have been suffering from TB and asthma since then. “My rights were violated and my dignity was taken away.” Fani said his house was destroyed to make way for a sewage pipe. “The pipe should have been put in another place. The municipality promised to build me a house, but nothing has been done. “I should be compensated. They must rebuild my four-roomed house and replace my furniture,” he said. The father of seven said municipal officials visited his home in September, but said anything about rebuilding his house. Outgoing Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said he was not aware of the incident and promised to investigate.
