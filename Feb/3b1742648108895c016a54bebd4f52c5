WHEN Skhonzile Mtshali’s 16-year-old daughter went to fetch her at a tavern, saying she was scared to sleep alone, the mum sent her home. She will regret the decision for the rest of her life because her daughter Mbali was shot dead while asleep in their shack. The 35-year-old from Lindelani squatter camp in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, said she wishes she could go back to Friday night. “My daughter is gone. I will never see her again. I wish I had listened to her. If I had,, my daughter might still be alive,” she said. “I usually go to the tavern and come back late. She opens for me when I knock on the door.” Skhonzile said she thinks on Friday, Mbali might have sensed something was wrong. She said when she returned home at 4am on Saturday morning, she found Mbali had been shot in the head while sleeping. “I walked to the police station to tell them my daughter had been killed.” Captain Thabo Sibuyi said a murder case was opened.
