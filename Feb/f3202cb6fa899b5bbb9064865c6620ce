FED up residents on Monday took the law into their own hands. They took action against three men they said were from Umlazi, eThekwini, who had been robbing people in their area. The residents of Magwaveni in Tongaat caught the three men driving around and allegedly beat them before setting them alight. A resident said they hoped thugs would think twice before committing crime in their area. “They started causing trouble on Friday, robbing and injuring people. We heard they were from Umlazi,” said the resident. Another resident said they wanted to show thugs not to mess with them. “We even found a gun on one of them.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said charges of murder were opened. “An unlicensed firearm was found next to the body of one of the victims.” Gwala said the circumstances surrounding the incident were being investigated.
