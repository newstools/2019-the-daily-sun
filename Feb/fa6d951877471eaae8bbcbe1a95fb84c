Driving on a busy street could not stop thugs from attacking and robbing a motorist. Malibongwe Drive in Joburg is one of the busiest streets in Mzansi. But that does not stop thugs from carrying out their criminal activities in broad daylight. The video was first posted by Reneilwe Sekgobela on Twitter with the caption: "Literally just witnessed a robbery on cnr Malibongwe & Oxford road. Two guys walking like normal civilians. Be vigilant guys.” She later Tweeted: ”We were only able to help him once those guys left, we offered to call anyone for him or drop him off so he could get his spare keys... he got beat up badly though…The car assistance people came and helped him too, I hope he’s okay now.”
