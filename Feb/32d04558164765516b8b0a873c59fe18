    A
Cape Town gunman shot two metro cops and also opened fire at a driver of a car
that was broken down. The
incident occurred on the N2 near Borcherds Quarry in Cape Town on Monday. The
City of Cape Town has offered a R50 000 reward for information that could lead to
the arrest and conviction of the gunman. â€œInformation
at hand indicates that the metro police officers were dispatched to the N2
inbound near Borcherds Quarry just after 02:00 after camera operators detected
rocks on the roadway," Mayoral committee member for safety and security JP
Smith said. "Officers
responded, but in the meantime, a motorist drove over the rocks and stopped on
the side of the road to attend to a burst tyre. While doing so, another vehicle
pulled over and one of the occupants shot the motorist." According
to News24, the two officers arrived at the scene and "inquired about what
had happened", the suspects fired on them, too. Both were injured. A
female officer was reportedly injured in the left leg and the other cop was
shot in the upper right leg and left side of his groin. Smith
said the shooter fled with a firearm belonging to one of the officers, a radio,
as well as some personal effects. Both
officers are in hospital.
