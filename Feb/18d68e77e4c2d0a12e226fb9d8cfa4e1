New dad, Khaya Mthethwa has rubbed some social media users up the wrong way. The pastor and musician has been openly sharing his experience as a first-time parent. Khaya is the one who broke the news once he and wife, Ntandoyenkosi Mthethwa’s son was born. Since then he has shared how beautiful it is to have welcomed his first child into the world. He also thanked Ntando for having carried their child and giving him the beautiful gift. But there is one little revelation that has rubbed people off the wrong way. “Made a mess of my first nappy change yesterday... I respect full time fathers,” Khaya tweeted. His TL quickly blew up with people dragging him over the “full time fathers” comment. “Maybe he means stay at home dads,” one user wondered while another asked: “What are the duties of a part time father ?” “You're messy yazi... what is a full time father? O part time wena?” another user said. Check out all the reactions below:
