NTOMBIKHOYO Venge is pleading for help to get medical treatment. The 45-year-old from Winnie Madikizela squatter camp in Cape Town told Daily Sun she needed dialysis, but doctors at Groote Schuur Hospital said they couldn’t help her until she lost weight. “They told me to go home because there is nothing they can do. They said I weigh too much,” she said. Ntombikhoyo said her health troubles started last month when her period didn’t stop. She was admitted to Mitchells Plain Hospital after doctors discovered she had fibroids in her uterus. After doctors did other tests, they found she also had kidney failure. “I was shocked because they said my kidneys were functioning at 5%. I was sent to Groote Schuur Hospital but didn’t get any help,” she said. Ntombikhoyo said doctors told her she could be treated at a private hospital because they had bigger dialysis machines. “I don’t have the money. I need to pay R14 000 a month for three months to recover. I need help,” she said. Mitchells Plain Hospital spokeswoman Monique Johnstone said they didn’t turn Ntombikhoyo away. “Due to the advanced nature of her disease, her condition was discussed by a renal medical specialist at Groote Schuur for her to have possible chronic dialysis and ultimately a transplant,” she said. “She was found to be an unsuitable candidate for dialysis due to her weight. These decisions are based on a nationally accepted criteria.” She said weight loss plans were presented to Ntombikhoyo.
