PRIVATE bus owners are worried that their buses will be torched. This comes after three buses were set alight in Newlands West, Durban, since Thursday. Ashley Naiker (45), whose bus was burnt on Sunday, said he did not know who was behind the attacks. On Thursday a bus was torched while on the road and two parked buses were burned. Naiker said they suspected taxi people were behind the attacks. “We’re using these buses to run a passenger business. We transport passengers from Newlands to town and bus fares are much cheaper,” said Naiker. He said they were confused because they had been providing the bus service for many years without any problems. “The taxis have their own passengers and we have our own. Honestly, we don’t know what to make of this,” he said. A passenger said they feared for their safety: “Our lives will be in danger if they set the buses on fire while we’re inside.” The passenger said the burning of the buses would leave them stranded. “When you travel to work every day you look for a cheaper way to get there. “Taxis are expensive for some of us, so we rely on buses,” said passenger. Newlands West Taxi Association chairman Fisokuhle Kheswa said: “We’re saddened by this. We don’t know what’s happening. We’re on good terms with the bus owners, so this has left us confused. “What saddens us is that the police have impounded about 15 of our taxis as they suspect us of torching the buses without doing any proper investigations.” KZN police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “Three cases of malicious damage to property have been opened at the Newlands East Police Station. “A case of attempted murder and one of armed robbery was opened after three unknown men flagged a bus, pretending to be passengers. “They pointed a firearm at the driver, demanding cellphones and cash, before setting the bus alight with petrol bombs.”
