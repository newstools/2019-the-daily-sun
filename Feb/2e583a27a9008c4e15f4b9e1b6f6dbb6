A MUSICIAN looking for a way to reinvent his career transformed
his face so radically that even his ex didn’t recognise him. And he blew Aus$15 155 (about R151 000) doing it. According to the Sun, Ian Starr Kalatzis (28) from
Brisbane, Australia suffered a knock to his confidence in 2009 when he left his
band Boystar. Now solo, he found his music career just wasn’t flying. He said: “I felt insecure and couldn’t get work after I
left the band, so I thought I needed to do something which gave me an edge. “A reinvention was needed to make myself feel happier and
more like myself again.” His journey to his new self began in 2013 with a trip to
America, where he got a nose job and cheek implants. Three trips to Iran between 2015 and 2018 resulted in Ian
having a chin implant, a jaw implant, brow lift, botox, fat transfer treatment,
and a “cat eye” operation. Ian believes that every cent he spent was worth it. He said: “People who say plastic surgery isn’t going to
change anything are liars. “We all manipulate ourselves somehow – whether it’s
contouring with make-up, shaving or dyeing our hair. “The only difference with me is that I make my changes
permanent. He admits his parents were at first shocked by their son’s
transformed face. He added: “One day after all my surgeries I ran into my
ex, who I was with before I had anything done. “He was flirting with me and asked me on a date – which
was when I realised he didn’t know who I was! “I told him no straight away and he seemed confused – as
he had no idea who he was asking out!” Slowly, Ian’s songwriting career started taking off
again. His music was used in Netflix movie The Kissing Booth and
was shortlisted for the Australian Eurovision entry. He said: “I don’t hate the person I was before. I think
he was happy enough, but somewhere along the way I lost myself. “I can’t say why or when, but it just happened. I had to
get out of it and change. Now my career and confidence are back, I’m finally
happy again.”
