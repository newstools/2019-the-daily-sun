PRIMARY school pupils took part in the Baswa le Meetse (Youth in Water) competition on Friday at the Bon Hotel in Bloemfontein. They competed in poetry, praise singing, drama and drawing. Water department spokesman Marcus Monyakeni told Daily Sun: “Competitors were showing the importance of using water properly.” Kgoledi Ya Manka Primaryteacher Lerato Moshoeshoe was proud of grade 6 pupil Thato Ntsane (12), who won the praise poetry category. “We’ll represent the province nationally in June,” she said.
