  Today the City of Johannesburg released the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department’s (JMPD) January report on crime and the success of their crime fighting efforts. The stats session took place at the New Council Chambers at the Metro center. According the Executive Mayor Cllr Herman Mashaba, the JMPD has been compiling monthly statistics since September last year and it has become a tool of reflection for officers as well as a way of informing residents. The City said the JMPD was working hard to increase the levels of safety within communities. He said with 557 arrests in January, driving under the influence still remains a concern. Meanwhile, Gauteng cops arrested more suspects in connection to stolen school property. The three suspects were involved in business robberies committed at Lenasia, Alexandra and Diepkloof Schools. “Top arrests for the month included possession of a hijacked or stolen vehicle, possession of stolen goods and reckless and negligent driving. In region E, which includes Alexandra and Sandton, 117 arrests of this nature were made, significantly higher than the other regions,” said Mashaba.  They also explained that music and sound equipment may also be impounded for bylaw violations as non compliance, along with a fine.  “We will not back down and will work tirelessly towards fighting crime in the city. Motorists should be warned because speed cameras are back and also those who dump illegally will be dealt with harshly,” said Tembe.
