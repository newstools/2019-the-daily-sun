EX-top cop Vincent Mdunge could be out of the Westville Prison on Wednesday. During his appearance in the Durban Magistrates Court on Friday, the state agreed to consider his application for a reduced sentence. Mdunge wants the state to turn the remainder of his five-year sentence into correctional supervision, which is supported by the parole board. He began his five-year sentence in 2017 after losing appeals in both the High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. Magistrate Sophie Reddy said the state had agreed to consider his application but wanted it heard in Port Shepstone by magistrate Thembeka Fikeni, because she was the one who had found him guilty in 2014. Fikeni resigned from the Durban court in 2015 and is now at the Port Shepstone Magistrates Court on the KZN South Coast. Mdunge first appeared in court three weeks ago to apply for the reduction of his sentence. If his application is granted, he will perform public duties for a period determined by the state. Mdunge was found to have faked his matric certificate while he was a senior superintendent and provincial police spokesman. He was found guilty of fraud and forgery. He presented a fake matric certificate to get a job as a cop in 1987.
