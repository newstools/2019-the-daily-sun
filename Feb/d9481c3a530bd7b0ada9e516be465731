SBUSO and Sbusiso Kgosiemang are 20-year-old twins. Sbuso claims he was expelled from Pule Leeuw High School in Huhudi, near Vryburg, North West for allegedly misbehaving and missing school. And he says Sbusiso was told to leave as well. But the education department said this was not so. Freddy Sepeng, spokesman for the provincial department of education, denied that the twins were expelled. He says for three years it has been the twins’ habit to come to school and never stay beyond June. Sepeng says looking at their age now, it is now unlikely they will be accepted back at the school, and said the term has already started. The boys said they weren’t given letters of expulsion and there was no disciplinary hearing. They claim the school did not call their gogo, where they live, and no teacher visited the family to find out why they didn’t come to school.
