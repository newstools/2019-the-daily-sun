The Polokwane Regional Court has sentenced a 26-year-old
rapist, Martin Tebogo Mamabolo to 40 years in jail. Mamabolo, from Mankweng location outside Polokwane, was
charged with two counts of rape that he committed between 2014 and 2015. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the
accused was using the same Modus Operandi in which he would lure his victims by
advertising that he is selling an RDP house at Unit F in Mankweng location. His action act began on October 2014 after he raped a 57-year-old
woman from Ga- Matlala village outside Polokwane. He said he phoned his victims and they agreed to meet him
in Polokwane. Upon their arrival, one of the victims was approached by
Mamabolo's nephew and the duo departed to Mankweng location intending to view
the RDP house on sale. "They arrived at the house and she rested in one of
the rooms while waiting for Mamabolo, unexpectedly, Mamabolo arrived and
forcefully raped her," said Ngoepe. He said another rape ordeal happened after his gentle
persuasion convinced a middle-aged woman whom she met on the street. Mamabolo took her to the house and while inside
inspecting the house, he dragged her to one of the rooms and raped her. Meanwhile, the Polokwane High court sentenced eight men
aged between 34 and 60 to a combined effective imprisonment of 33 yearsÂ  each without fine for kidnapping, murder and
attempted murder. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police
Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has warmly welcomed these
long term incarcerations of the accused that do not belong to the society.
