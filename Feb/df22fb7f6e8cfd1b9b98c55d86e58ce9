The CRL Rights Commission has ruled that prophet Shepherd Bushiri and his church were not responsible for the stampede that killed 3 people at his church. CLR released their findings on Friday, following a 2-day hearing that was held this week. CRL Rights Commission chaiperson Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said the Commission found that the application by Enlightened Christian Gathering Church (ECG) for the event of 28 December 2018 was fully compliant with the bylaws and the Safety at Sports and Recreation Events Act 2 of 2010. There are elements of non-effectiveness in the bylaws and the JOC [Tshwane's joint operations committee] system," said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva. She said that there was, per section 17(2)(a)(i) of SSRE Act, supposed to have been a venue operations centre (VOC) established at the event of 28 December 2018 since the event is categorised as medium-risk. “Such was not established," she said. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva added that The City of Tshwane did not dispute that SAPS was not on site on the 28 December 2018 since they were also not on site. “It is on a balance of probability that the Commission finds that the SAPS was not present.  Accordingly, the SAPS failed to comply with the SSRE Act." The commission also in its findings that the expressions that Bushiri must leave the country are discriminatory.
