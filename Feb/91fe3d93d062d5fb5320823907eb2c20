The ANC has issued an apology to both Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan and the ANC head of Organizing, Senzo Mchunu. ANC Acting National Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said that following a thorough investigation on statements attributed to Mchunu and Gordan, they have since established that their remarks were taken out of context. On February 20, the ANC issued a statement in which it said it has noted utterances attributed to Mchunu and Gordhan. The ANC found “these utterances rather unfortunate.  The attack on black professionals is neither warranted nor acceptable and goes against the grain of ANC policy.” Kodwa said the ANC extends an unreserved apology to both Mchunu and Gordhan for its statement issued following these media reports. “The ANC acknowledges the importance of constructive engagement with all professionals including black engineers and the Black Management Forum.” The ANC said it believes that it is important to have such engagements on an ongoing basis in order to discuss issues of mutual interest and find a common ground. “The ANC, within its structures, has a wide range of progressive professional bodies and has worked very hard to build and maintain the progressive and revolutionary relationships. “The ANC remains committed to supporting black professionals, academics and entrepreneurs across sectors and believes that they are important roleplayers in our economy. “The ANC will meet with the black professionals in the coming week and engage on issues of mutual interest and unpack how the ANC’s manifesto responds to the pressing issues affecting them that arose from earlier engagements.”
