AN 11-YEAR-OLD boy from Waterloo Village has probably drowned, after taking a short cut to a soccer match on Saturday. The victim and his six friends were going to the other side of the village when the incident happened at the river separating Temple Valley and Coniston in Verulam, north of Durban. Prem Balram, a spokesman for Reaction Unit SA, said their members are searching for the boy. They received a call from a resident at about 12.30pm after one of the victim’s friends ran to his home. Balram said they spoke to one of the boys who told them they were on their way to the Verulam Grounds to play soccer. “Five boys managed to cross the river while two of their friends experienced difficulties. One of the boys managed to grab onto a tree while his friend was dragged under the water. “Paramedics were on standby at the water’s edge to revive the child immediately if he was located. The river was more than two metres deep.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “The cops and Metro police search and rescue units are currently on the scene.”
