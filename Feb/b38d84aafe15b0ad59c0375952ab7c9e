SOUTH AFRICA has the lowest survival rates when it comes to
childhood cancers. Each year, more than 300 000 aged between 19 years are
diagnosed with cancer around the world. Approximately eight in 10 of these children live in low and
middle income countries. “In South Africa, we should be diagnosing around 2 500
children per year but unfortunately we are only diagnosing approximately 1 500,
of the less than half who are actually detected and diagnosed, this survival
rate is as low as 55%” CEO of (ChOC) Childhood Cancer Foundation Carl Queiros
said. Therefore Mzansi has the lowest children cancer survival
rates. “We are committed working with international partners,
including the WHO, Childhood Cancer International (CCI), towards the global
goal of reducing childhood cancer mortality and the elimination of
cancer-related pain and suffering” Said Carl Last year September, at the United Nations General Assembly,
the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced its new global initiative to
address the disparity between childhood cancer survivals in low-middle versus
high-income countries. Carl encouraged the citizens of Mzansi to stand united to
make childhood cancer a national and global child health priority in support of
the Global Childhood Cancer Target Goals. “As we celebrate our 40 years of existence this year, we want
to continue growing our impact as an organisation and we continue to rely
heavily on individual and corporate support and participation”
