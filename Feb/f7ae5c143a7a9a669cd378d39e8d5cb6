A 43-year-old
man has been arrested for stabbing and killing his wife. The couple allegedly
had a quarrel at their home on Sunday, at Nkelekethe Village, in the Eastern
Cape. The man
reportedly drew his knife and stabbed the wife in her upper body. When the wife
began bleeding profusely, he decided to take her to the Dutywa Health Centre. However, she
was confirmed dead on arrival. Police
spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said they were informed that the victim was murdered by her husband. “The suspect is due to appear before the
Willowvale Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, 05 February on a murder charge,” Manatha
said. Manatha added
that the identity of the victim is still being withheld until all her family
members are officially informed of her dead. Acting
Butterworth Cluster Commander Colonel Ncedo Ngwendze condemned the cold blooded
murder of the woman, by the person who was supposed to protect her.
