The incident happened in Phola Park kasi, Mangaung. Now gogo Oshenia (67) is trying to find the boy who saved her granddaughters so she can thank him. “My grandkids were fetched by a friend and went outside to play. I later heard they’d fallen into a stream. When I rushed to the scene, I saw Thulaganyo and Sibahle in an ambulance,” she said. “I heard a boy of about 12 managed to pull Thulaganyo and Sibahle out of the water, but couldn’t save Chidimma. Now I want to thank the boy for saving the two girls.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said an inquest docket has been opened.
