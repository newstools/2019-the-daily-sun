WOMEN in Mzansi are hurt and angry about what has been happening to their sisters! Women students at Tshwane University of Technology’s Soshanguve campus held a march against the brutal killings and rapes of women on Wednesday. They marched topless to the Soshanguve Police Station, saying two students were raped two weeks ago and they didn’t feel safe in the area or in the country. March leader Twinky Nxumalo said they wanted the police to protect them.  “Two students were raped in their rooms outside campus last Thursday and their landlady couldn’t help them. We are not happy and want to be heard.” She said they handed over a memorandum to the police. “We demand them to patrol where students live so these type of things don’t happen. “We expect landlords to make sure we live in safe places,” she said. Twinky said they decided to march topless to provoke rapists. “We want them to see us, because even if we are topless that mustn’t make them force themselves on us.”   She said they wanted the death penalty back. Lerato Marang (23), said: “We’ve had enough. Women have been silent and it’s time to solve this.”
