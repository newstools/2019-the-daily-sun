DESPITE being haunted by the tragic deaths of close friends and relatives, he won’t quit. Since March, Idols SA runner-up Thato Makape has lost nine people who were close to his heart. Thato from Postmasburg in Northern Cape said this had held him back and he struggled to pursue his career. He said he lost two friends in March, his pianist in April, another friend in May, one uncle in June, and two more uncles in July.  Last month, he buried his mother’s cousin, while his friend and former Idols contestant Thami Shobede died recently. The young artist told Daily Sun: “People thought I’d been quiet, but there’d been one funeral after another. I was never quiet.” While grieving the deaths of the friends who died in March, Thato received more devastating news.  “In April, I heard my pianist had died. I lost another dear friend in May,” he said. Then death claimed his uncle in June. “In July, I lost two uncles after a car crash.
