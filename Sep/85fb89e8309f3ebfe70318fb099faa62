Manila, Phillipines ~ PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte just keeps getting bugged during his public speeches. A noisy gecko was the latest wildlife contributor to an address by Duterte, interrupting the leader on Thursday night just as he launched another tirade at human rights groups critical of his bloody war on drugs. The reptile’s persistence caused laughter in the crowd of mostly soldiers, causing Duterte to stop mid-sentence, turn to his left and pause for a while to see what the off-camera commotion was. “You brought a gecko here?” he asked an official sitting behind him, drawing laughs. Geckos are common across Southeast Asia. The small lizard-like reptiles are known for their ability to produce various loud sounds. – REUTERS
