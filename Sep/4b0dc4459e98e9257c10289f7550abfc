CHIPPA United chief operations officer (COO), Lukhanyo Mzizi, has laughed off reports that they have "FIRED" their coach Duran Francis. "No one is fired this time at Chippa United," Mzizi told SunSport yesterday. "Duran is our employee, and he will remain our employee. Because people enjoy mocking us, we are just watching at this thing and shake our heads in disappointment." According to Mzizi, Francis will be going back to his old position as their Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) and ABC Motsepe League team coach while making way for the new coach. SunSport understands that Chippa have already appointed a new international coach who will be watching their Absa Premiership game against Bidvest Wits at Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Tuesday night on the stands. Explains Mzizi: "I cannot tell you now who we have appointed. All I can say is that he is a good coach and will be at the stadium tomorrow." Mbuyiselo Sambu has been tasked with taking care of the team against Wits on Tuesday "we are trying to bring him closer to the team again since the new coach will be watching from the stands". "We are an ambitious club and will not be held back by such specualtions," he added. Chippa part ways with their coach Clinton Larsen last week following an array of terrible results that have pushed them down the pecking order of the PSL log. Chippa are currently placed 15th on the log with four points from seven games - lost three and drew three, with no win.
