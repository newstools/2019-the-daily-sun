MARITZBURG United chairman Farouk Kadodia confirmed that Deolin Mekoa and Mohau Mokate have been given their clearances and can find new teams. Winger Mekoa and forward Mokate had been part of the Team of Choice since 2014 but could not command regular game time under head coach Eric Tinkler. It was then agreed that the club would release them, and they can find employment elsewhere. Kadodia told Goal: "Mekoa and Mokate have left the club before the transfer window's deadline last week. "Their contracts were coming to an end and we felt that we can release them on time to find game time at a new club rather than become fringe players with us. "I think we're covered in their positions." Maritzburg will take on defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns in their next league fixture on 21 September. - TeamTalk Media
