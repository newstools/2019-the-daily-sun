FRIDAY was World Alzheimer’s Day, and the increase in the prevalence of this disease is a worry for the whole world. Alzheimer’s South Africa statistics show that by 2030, there will be an estimated 75,6 million people with dementia (Alzheimer’s is the most common sub-group of dementia) worldwide – that will rise to 135,5 million by 2050. But the question SunHealth wants to ask you is: “Do you know what is Alzheimer’s, how to notice it and what to do about it?” Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60% to 80% of dementia cases. Simply put, it is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with the disease –those with the late-onset type – symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. A quick search on Alzheimer’s Association website found that the most common early symptom of this disease is difficulty remembering new-learned information. Serious memory loss, confusion and other major changes in the way our minds work may be a sign that brain cells are failing. So if you quickly forget things, you need to check if you do not suffer from this disease. As it advances through the brain it leads to increasingly severe symptoms, including disorientation, mood and behaviour changes; deepening confusion about events, time and place; unfounded suspicions about family, friends and professional caregivers; more serious memory loss and behaviour changes; and difficulty speaking, swallowing and walking. The association said people with memory loss or other possible signs of Alzheimer’s may find it hard to recognise they have a problem. Signs of dementia may be more obvious to family members or friends. Anyone experiencing dementia-like symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible.
