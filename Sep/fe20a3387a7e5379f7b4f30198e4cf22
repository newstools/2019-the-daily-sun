ACCORDING to gogo Georginah Setlhola, her family has abandoned her. But her daughter and grandchildren told Daily Sun they moved out of the 66-year-old gogo’s home in Seshego zone 8, Limpopo, three months ago because she was abusing them emotionally. Her daughter Nkele (48) said she loved her mum but she had insulted her and threatened to evict her after getting drunk. “My mum would order us to leave the house and insult my children and I. “We packed up and left even though we had nowhere go,” Nkele said. The gogo said she felt lonely and depressed and had been drinking before her daughter was born. “I can’t leave alcohol now and they always raise issues when I’m drunk, knowing I’ll overreact. Now I’m an orphan with no family members,” she said. “Yes, I chased them out because it’s painful living with people who don’t talk to you at times.” Another family member said both the gogo and her daughter were stubborn, saying the gogo was loud when she got drunk. “From what I understand, the gogo was chased away from Nkele’s house in Tshwane by her grandson Phetogo and things got worse when she went home to Seshego. “Now they are not talking to each other.” Phetolo (27) said no one could stand the gogo’s behaviour, which was caused by her drinking. “Now she’s claiming I chased her away from my mum’s house in Tshwane but I live in Joburg. “The last time I went to the house was two months ago and I found tenants there,” he said.
