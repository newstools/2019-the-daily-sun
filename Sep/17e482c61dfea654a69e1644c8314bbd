SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo is keeping fingers crossed that 10 of his players, who are away on national duty, return without injury. Tembo said having seven of his international players reporting for camp two days before their crucial Absa Premiership clash against Cape Town City is also a worrying factor. The teams will battle it out at Mbombela Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm). His winger Kudakwashe Mahachi and striker Evans Rusike will play for Zimbabwe against Somalia in the 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifier today. “Seven will only return on Thursday and it’s difficult for planning purposes because I am not sure at what state they will be,” explained a concerned Tembo. Despite the setback, Tembo is confident his side will tame The Citizens, who beat them 1-0 in the second round last season having also booted them out of Nedbank Cup with a 2-0 scoreline in January. SuperSport are fourth on the log table with seven points from four matches, while Benni McCarthy’s charges occupy eighth position on five points from the same number of matches. “I don’t focus on history and I think we have a chance to beat them because this is a new game. We need to stay positive and try to ensure we work hard. We are looking forward to getting positive results, but it won’t be easy.” However, Matsatsantsa a Pitori’s defence will need to keep a close eye on former Orlando Pirates striker Kermit Erasmus. Explained Tembo: “They were unlucky to lose against Kaizer Chiefs (2-1) because they dominated the first half. They worked well as a unit and Kermit is regaining his scoring form. We need to keep an eye on him.” He revealed that the Fifa break gave players like Aubrey Modiba and Thabo Qalinge the chance to catch up with the rest of squad. But the Tshwane side will miss Grank Kekana and Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali, who are still nursing ankle injury.
