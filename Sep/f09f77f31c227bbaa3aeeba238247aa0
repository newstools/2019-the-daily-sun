The IFP
GAUTENG gives thanks to Prince Buthelezi for put an end to the attacks that
have been happening in Johannesburg. The IFP
Gauteng Provincial Chairperson Bonginkosi Dhlamini said the IFP Leadership in
Gauteng extends gratitude to IFP President Emeritus, Prince Mangosuthu
Buthelezi MP for showing leadership and sharing wisdom in trying to quell
xenophobia in Johannesburg this past Sunday. He said
iziNduna and local leadership had awaited the arrival of National Police
Minister Bheki Cele who had promised the community that he together with his
government counterparts were to address the concerns of residents, yet he and
others postponed the meeting at the eleventh hour. “As
responsible leaders and responsive to the needs of the community in
Johannesburg and South Africa at large, it was important that we continue with
the Imbizo together with leaders of faith-based organizations to address
looting, criminality and xenophobia,” said Dhlamini. Dhlamini
told Daily Sun that the message delivered by Prince Buthelezi was well
received, however, disgruntled residents simply ignored law enforcement
agencies and continued to antagonize foreign nationals. “We call on
the community to isolate criminals and report criminal activity as violence is
not the solution to seek justice.  The
IFP in Gauteng believes that many are saddened at the fact that government
simply does not walk its talk when making promises it cannot keep,” he said. “Government
leaders cannot fight each other at a time when the country’s economic hub is
burning. The IFP
believes that together we can work towards finding amicable solutions to
fighting criminality and quell xenophobia,” he added.
