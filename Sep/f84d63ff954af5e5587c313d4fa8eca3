MORE than 60 trainees were excited when they were selected to join the War On Leaks plumbing and welding programme in 2016. The youths were sent to Tradesmen Skills and Training in Seshego zone 6, outside Polokwane, in Limpopo. They were told they would receive a R2 500 monthly stipend from Rand Water while being trained as welders and plumbers. However, they have not been receiving their stipends regularly since May. Mosepele Malatji (27) told Daily Sun: “Now we’re suffering. Sometimes, we get it more than 10 days late.” Some said they were forced to ask their parents for money while others had to go home for groceries. A few even dropped out from the three-year programme because they had nowhere to stay. Pertunia Malepe (27) said she was evicted after being three months behind with her rent. Water and Sanitation Department spokesman Sputnik Ratau said there was no money for the initiative, which ends in November. “The programme was not budgeted for, so we cannot continue with irregular expenditure. We’re busy working with national Treasury to find a way forward so we can get funding,” said Ratau.
