Besides bestowing the golden Waldo statuette upon victorious comics, the awards also served up top-notch entertainment in the form of a well-produced theatrical piece titled "Funny Money" which tells the story of a young man with dreams of making it big the SA comedy scene. Winners on the night included legendary comedian Soli Philander, who walked away with the title of Lifetime Achiever, as well as Celest Ntuli who was honoured with not one, but two awards.
