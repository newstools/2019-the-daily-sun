FROM Varsity Football to scoring an important goal in the history of Highlands Park football club! That is the story of rising footballer Mokete Mogaila. The former University of Johannesburg striker scored the winning penalty as Highlands Park made history when they reached their first ever domestic Cup final. The Lions of the North defeated Polokwane City 4-3 in a dramatic penalty shoot-out to reach the MTN8 Wafa Wafa cup final. Their two legged semi-final matches ended in goalless draws in Polokwane and Tembisa. Owen da Gamaâ€™s boys held their nerves to seal their place in the first domestic cup final of the season after their second leg encounter against Rise and Shine ended goalless at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa last night. Mogaila, who played at Varsity Football just last season, fulfilled a life long dream as he stepped up to beat Zimbabwean goalkeeper George Chigova to score the deciding penalty that sent the home fans and the players into wild celebrations. Highlands will play the winner between Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United in the cup final at a venue to be decided by the PSL. The first-leg played to a goalless draw at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane three weeks ago. Park played two matches in Tembisa and failed to keep a clean sheet in the league. They lost 3-2 to Kaizer Chiefs and defeated AmaZulu 2-1 here. Rise and Shine have been doing well away from home having beaten Cape Town City 2-0 in the Mother City to get to this stage.
