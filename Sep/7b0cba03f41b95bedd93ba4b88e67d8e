NYANGA cops have urged residents to travel in groups when walking to work. Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi said this would help them avoid getting robbed. Sitshitshi said thugs targeted people who walked alone. She told Daily Sun people should stop using earphones as these attract criminals. “We’re doing everything in our power to fight crime, but we need the community to work with us,” she said. She also advised people to only carry money they are going to use. “If you know that you’re going to use R500, there’s no need to carry R1 500 with you,” said Sitshitshi. She said police arrested 111 suspects last week for various crimes. “Some were arrested for armed robbery, especially those targeting Taxify and Uber, murder, possession of hijacked vehicles, rape and sexual assault,” she said. Sitshitshi urged residents to stop buying stolen goods. Resident Nyameka Somhlahlo (38) said the high number of arrests was concerning. “We’ll never move from being the country’s murder capital,” Nyameka told the People’s Paper.
