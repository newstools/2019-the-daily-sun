AMERICAN jazz saxophonist and songwriter Kirk Whalum and his compatriot Deborah Cox are headed to Mzansi. The two award-winning artists have been booked to perform at the annual Mangaung African Cultural Festival (Macufe) in Bloemfontein, Free State, next month. The two American stars will join the crème dela crème of Mzansi artists for 10 days of celebration of cultural festivities. According to the event organiser, Ben Moseme, they booked the duo due to popular demand. “We’d been running a social media campaign on who people want to see at this year’s show and the two came up tops,” Ben said. He said the campaign ran from late last year and ended early this year. “The aim of the campaign was to involve fans in the line-up selection. At the end of the campaign, we started negotiating with the two artists. “They were also easy to work with and were within our tight budget.” Ben said this year, the festival celebrates 22 years of existence with a mix of legends the likes of Tsepo Tshola sharing the stage with Vusi Nova, Sjava and Sho Madjozi, among others. This year’s theme is, Tlo Be Rele Daar. The festival kicks off from 4 to 13 October. The festival ends with a soccer match between Bloemfontein Celtics and Kaizer Chiefs.
