AFTER she got married, her mum told her to use korobela to stop her man from cheating. Lindiwe loved her husband so much she did as she was told. So her mum got korobela from a sangoma. Lindiwe Mabena (38) then lived happily with her husband Samson (43) for seven years. But when her mum died three years ago, that was the start of her troubles. Now Lindiwe from KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga said the korobela has turned her marriage upside down and her man into a serial cheater. “The korobela was working. He only had eyes for me,” said Lindiwe. She told Daily Sun she regretted giving her husband korobela as he never was a cheater. “I thought this was a great idea and didn’t want to lose my man. He was transparent about everything, including telling me about all the women who’ve been chasing him,” she said. After her mum’s death Lindiwe thought Samson was just sleeping around, and he confessed and even cried after cheating. “I knew right there and then this had to do with the bheka mina ngedwa (look at me only).” She said her mum was the one who gave her husband muthi every three months and she didn’t know where she got it from. “I thought of giving him korobela again, but was told there might be more complications in my marriage,” said Lindiwe. But Samson told Daily Sun he was never a cheater and this started after his mamezala’s death. “I don’t know what drives me to do it, but it scares me,” said Samson. “I was disappointed when my wife told me about the korobela, but I love her and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get back in line. This isn’t me.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said the korobela wore off. “She’s lucky her husband still loves her. If she decides to do this again, he might cheat even more.” He advised against it.
