After Arthur was  found not guilty of assaulting his former girlfriend, Cici whose real name is Busisiwe Thwala, she vowed to fight on. Now the singer has revealed that Arthur's home has been attached by his lawyers. Cici revealed that Arthur failed to pay her legal bills, which has now resulted in her lawyers going after his home. "A man who falsely accused me of lying in court  about my incident even took to newspapers has been dealt with. He was slapped with a legal bill and also was punished by court to settle my legal fees. He was unable to do so, now my lawyers have attached his home. #notdone," she tweed. Her protracted legal battle emanated from an alleged incident that left her with physical bruises. She alleged that Arthur dragged her with his car at his Midrand home. However, Arthur denies his home was attached, saying  this is new to him. He said he is still recovering from "emotional abuse suffered from biased media reporting". "Maybe this judgment is still coming through. I know of no such judgment against me. In humility, I would like to request that my privacy be respected meanwhile I am recovering from emotional abuse suffered from the public and biased media reporting about me," he said.
