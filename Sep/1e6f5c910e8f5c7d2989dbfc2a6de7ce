THIS week was rather a sad and busy one. My social diary was fully booked, so I had to get a body double to attended some events. Anyhow, I started at Sports Scene, where they were launching their flagship store in Southern Africa. They were also announcing the Sport Scene put me on competition. The doo was held in Sandton City, north of Jozi. It was attended by all kinds of influencers – from the ones who get paid with goody bags to the those who gets paid with free booze and the one’s who get paid with actual cash. There were a few familiar faces. From there I attended another fabulous launch of the Joburg Film Festival at the Rosebank Circa Art Galary. The intimate doo was mostly attended by film industry expects. Well done, boo. The main event is from 19 to 24 November. Also managed to spot veteran actress, Connie Chiume, who’s ageing like fine wine.
