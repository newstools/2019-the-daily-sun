EUROPE appears to have been spared an outbreak of the mysterious vaping-induced illnesses that have claimed seven lives in the US, prompting a backlash against e-cigarettes. But regulators said they were closely monitoring the situation. In Europe, e-cigarettes have had mixed success, with strong uptake in countries such as Britain and France. But there’s little appetite for them in Germany, where tobacco ads are still allowed in cinemas and on the street. E-cigarettes, which heat a liquid that turns to a tarless vapour when inhaled, are more tightly regulated in Europe than in the US. A 2014 EU directive limits the amount of nicotine contained in e-liquids to 20mg/ml, less than is available in some parts of the US. Most European countries subject e-cigarettes to the same restrictions as tobacco – banning their use in closed public spaces, and restricting sales to over 18s. – NEWS24
