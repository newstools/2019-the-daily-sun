BERNING Ntlemeza pressured an Ipid investigator to finalise the Zimbabwean rendition case because it stood in the way of his appointment as head of the Hawks. Ex-Limpopo Ipid head Innocent Khuba told the Zondo Commission yesterday Ntlemeza met him in 2013 and asked him how far he was with the case. “He indicated to me that ‘your report is the one that is holding me from being appointed there’. That’s what he told me,” said Khuba, adding he met Ntlemeza several times before his appointment as head of the Hawks. “He told me the political principals had changed their minds and he was no longer going to be appointed as executive director of Ipid but as Hawks head,” he said. In another meeting, Ntlemeza told him he was doing a good job and that then crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli was impressed. He said Ntlemeza also told him Mdluli was going to be “our next president.” Khuba testified that Ntlemeza called him to another meeting in December 2014 at which he told him he had good news. “He told me there was going to be a hit on Dramat and I must watch television in the coming weeks,” said Khuba. He said Dramat was suspended a short while later and Ntlemeza was appointed in his position. Meanwhile, commission Raymond Zondo ordered that the testimony of intelligence officer Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo be held behind closed doors. He said Naidoo, who is currently in witness protection, will not be present in the inquiry hearing room but in a separate room at an unknown location. His evidence is expected to be heard today.
