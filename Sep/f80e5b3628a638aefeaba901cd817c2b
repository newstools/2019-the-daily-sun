Singer Lady Zamar said she is tired of people who always give her advice about her facial acne. She expressed this through a post on Twitter. The singer went on to say that she plans on blocking anybody who mentions her acne problems. Lady Zamar trended on social media last month after Durban based singer Babes Wodumo made fun of her acne in a video that eventually went viral.   She said people need to know that she's not blind nor stupid to be walking around with visible acne without trying to find ways to remedy it. She said she is currently on an acne treatment and like any other treatment it takes time for it to work.
