A COUNCILLOR was arrested on Tuesday in connection with a business robbery! The arrest took place at the corner of Catherine and Pretoria streets in Hillbrow, Joburg. The councillor from Westonaria and his accomplices were allegedly found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Captain Musa Shihambe told Daily Sun two sergeants were on duty when their instincts led them to the thugs. Sergeant Nelo Mdlolo said they were on patrol when they spotted a suspicious-looking Mercedes-Benz. “We searched the occupants and found two of these men with unlicensed firearms.” ALSO READ: MKHULU BUST
FOR SELLING 3 MEN INTO FORCED LABOUR! Mdlolo said as they were searching the car, they found money and were approached by two people who told them the men had robbed them earlier in the morning. “We took them in and they’ve been charged with business robbery and having unlicenced firearms,” he said. Sergeant Andrew Motlhoana told Daily Sun he was disappointed in the councillor. “He even had DA T-tshirts in the boot of his car. They are our leaders and people look up to them, but we’ll keep working until our communities are free from these crimes.” Daily Sun tried to call DA provincial spokeswoman Lulama Mankabane several times,but she had not responded at the time of going to print. Provincial leader John Moodey was not aware of the matter. “A disciplinary will be determined by the outcome of the case. We strongly condemn such behaviour and, if he’s guilty, drastic measures will be taken against him. We won’t allow him to damage our image,” he said.
