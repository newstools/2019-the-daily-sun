WILL new Black Leopards coach Luc Eymael make an immediate impact and help turn the struggling club’s fortunes around? Eymael joined Leopards this week, but he will not have direct influence as his side host Bloemfontein Celtic at Thohoyandou Stadium this afternoon (3pm) owing to a work permit. But the big question on everyone’s lips as Lidoda Dhuva’s fans grow increasingly anxious to see notable improvement from their team. They will be hoping the Belgian, who is no stranger to Mzansi football, having had successful stints with Free State Stars and Polokwane City, can quickly work his magic at the Limpopo club. Leopards only have a solitary win under their belt in their six outings so far this season and are desperate for an upturn in form. Their early season struggle saw them make the decision to ditch Frenchman Lionel Soccoia and replace him with Eymael, who is proven in the PSL. Eymael believes the key to Leopards’ success will lie in their ability to turn the Thohoyandou Stadium into a fortress this season. “It’s always tough for opposition teams to play in Thohoyandou, it’s a strength that we have to use during our home games,” said Eymael. “I hope that I will be able to deliver, but I can’t do it alone. I’m not God. “It will take team work, the coach can put in place the best plan in the world. But if the players don’t want to respond then it won’t work. “We also need the support of every single individual within the club. We need to be really close to each other if we want to succeed.” Thabo Matlaba is expected to lead the team, even under Eymael. Meanwhile, Highlands Park and Polokwane City, who must be sick of each other’s sight by now, will resume their battle this afternoon at Makhulong Stadium (3pm). Rise and Shine will be eyeing revenge after Highlands bundled them out of the MTN8 final. However, the Lions of the North, who are unbeaten since their opening day defeat to table-topping Kaizer Chiefs, will prove a tough nut to crack at home.
