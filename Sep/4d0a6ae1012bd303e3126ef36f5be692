That's what women across Mzansi are saying. Today the members of various civil society organizations took to different streets to spread the message and make sure that their pleads are heard. They said they are tired of being abused by the people who are supposed to be protecting them. "Instead of protecting us, men abuse us. They rape us, beat us and kill us. We are tired and we want this to stop," said Civil society organization spokeswoman in Soweto, Kamo Seleka. She told Daily Sun that today they decided to wear black and go to the streets to pass on the message and that they hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. She said that a big march had been organized for Friday (13/ 09). "It will be a shutdown. We are shutting down Sandton. We will be there as early as 3am. We don't want businesses to operate on that day. It can't be business as usual while we suffer," she said. The women said that they were in support of Uyinene Mrwetyana, a UCT students who was raped and killed. The hashtags #SilenceisNOTanoption #IWILLNOTBENEXT are the ones used to promote the shutdown. It's not just women in Soweto but also in the Vaal, Alexander, KZN and many other places, women are singing the same song.
