CHIPPA United coach Clinton Larsen aims to take advantage of Orlando Pirates’ poor string of form. The Chilli Boys, who have also not hit the ground running, will visit the Buccaneers at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3pm). The impact of Bucs’ poor form has been felt heavily by the untimely departure of coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic, who resigned on the eve club’s match against Highlands Park in the MTN8 quarter finals. Since the Serb left the club, Pirates have not won in the last two matches under interim coach Rhulani Mokwena. In fact, it is now six games, including two under Micho. This has given Larsen confidence. He’s relishing the encounter and feels they have a chance to hurt Bucs. “I think if there’s time to play against them, this is the time. It is how we look at it,” revealed Larsen. “We’ll try and go there and make their lives uncomfortable. I think right now they are not in a positive space in terms of confidence. “But the thing about big clubs is that they can turn it on any given point. “So, we just have to be wary of that.” Despite Chippa having not won any matches this season, Larsen has not been deflated by his side’s display. He wants a repeat of the team’s performances they dished out in their past four league matches. The PE-based side, who are 13th on the log table with three points, last they registered a win in the last game of last season against Kaizer Chiefs at home. According to Larsen, in the matches against Stellenbosch FC, Mamelodi Sundowns, Golden Arrows and Polokwane City, they totally dominated but their inability to score let them down. “We want to turn things around. In the games we played so far, we totally dominated those teams but it is just we haven’t been able to get the desired results,” Larsen revealed. This game was brought forward by the PSL after the Soweto giants were eliminated in the Caf Champions League preliminary stages.
