EASTERN Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said the government was working to improve health services in the province. “We ask public servants to take their jobs very seriously,” he said. “Those who don’t want to work must step aside because there are many people out there who want to work.” Mabuyane said it was sad to see people sleeping on chairs in hospitals. “Health service is one of our priorities in the province. We want to improve people’s lives, especially in rural areas,” he said. Mabuyane was speaking at the handover of 129 brand new vehicles in Bhisho recently. He was accompanied by Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba and Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana. Mabuyane asked health workers to be responsible. “Please don’t use these ambulances to fetch your loved ones or partners,” he said. “We must not see these vehicles at traditional or wedding ceremonies.” Tikana said: “These ambulances will surely give the people of our beautiful province quality services on wheels. “This is in line with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s rallying call to ‘khawuleza, which is meant for public servants to move with speed in attending to people’s needs.” Gomba said they were responding to people’s cries for more ambulances.
