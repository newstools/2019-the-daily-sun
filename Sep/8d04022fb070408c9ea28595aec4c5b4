MAMELODI Sundowns were at their ruthless best as they romped to an impressive 11-1 victory over Cote d'Or in the second leg of their Champions League clash to secure a 16-1 aggregate win and a place in the group stages. Boasting a massive 5-0 victory in their first-leg tie, Downs were able to approach this clash with their place in the group stages of Africa's premier club competition all but assured. However, with coach Pitso Mosimane having requested plenty of goals from his team in the lead up to Friday's encounter, they most certainly did not disappoint. Themba Zwane opened the home side's account in the ninth minute before Gaston Sirino slotted home from close range in the 19th minute. And the floodgates opened after the 20-minute mark as Sibusiso Vilakazi scored two goals in quick succession to put the result to bed with over 70 minutes of football left in the clash. Sundowns showed no mercy, though, as Vilakazi popped up again in the 39th minute to complete his hat-trick, before Thapelo Morena got in on the act a few minutes before the half-time whistle rang out. The hosts didn't let up after the break, with Motjeka Madisha firing home in the 47th minute before first-half substitute Anele Ngcongca found the back of the net on 57 minutes. And Downs rubbed further salt in the wounds of the visitors as Zwane netted his second of the game in the 74th minute before Cote d'Or's captain put the ball in his own net following a dangerous ball into the box by Sirino. Credit must go to Cote d'Or, however, as they kept plugging away in a bid to net a consolation and they finally got the breakthrough they were searching for in the 79th minute as Kassah Voavy fired home. Downs were quick to respond, though, as debutant Mauricio Affonso scored just two minutes after entering the field of play to make it 11-1 to the hosts.
