NOT many people know that Alexandra, north of Joburg, has its own hotel. The hotel is a shack just like most homes in the area. The only difference is that it’s a double-storey and looks fancy. When the SunTeam visited the hotel, its owner Steve Mkhwanazi (76) switched on the lights for a clearer view. Madala Steve said he built it himself when he was younger and strong. “It used to be the talk of the town back then when I was still able to maintain it,” he said. The madala said he wanted a young man to run the hotel. “I still get customers. They come to the township for different reasons,” he said. He charges R199 for a night. “It has always been that price,” he said. The only thing that consistently puts food on the table for the madala is the bar. It is at the entrance. When the SunTeam arrived, patrons were having beers. “This is the safest and peaceful place here in Alex,” said Joseph Masinga (42), a patron. He said he lives in the area. “I use the hotel every now and then, especially when I’ve found a new woman,” he joked.
