THE country may not win their home Rugby World Cup, but they have already proved themselves world beaters when it comes to toilets. Going to the loo is a much more futuristic experience in the Land of the Rising Sun, and touring fans have been fascinated by their visit to these high-tech “washlets”. These Japanese toilets offer a wide variety of functions. Some open automatically when you approach them and many offer a warm seat for a bit of comfort on cold winter nights. The options on the control panel, however, can be confusing.  Two hours after landing at Tokyo’s Haneda airport, French fan Alex Weimer wouldn’t call his first experience a great one. “There were something like 15 buttons in Japanese and I didn’t know which one to press, he said. “There were strange symbols, with sprays going in every direction.” “The flush was on the other side. I frantically pressed all the buttons and it made strange noises.” – REUTERS
