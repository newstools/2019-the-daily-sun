TEACHING and learning at Lutholi Primary School was suspended by angry parents. A six-year-old grade R pupil recently fell into a pit toilet at the school. On Wednesday, parents and pupils from Sibangweni Village in Libode near Mthatha staged a sit-in at the Eastern Cape Department of Education offices demanding action. Sanco members also joined the sit-in. TEEN LINKED TO SOLDIER'S MURDER LINKED TO GANG RAPE CASE SGB chairman Tolakele Noraqa said the department promised to build toilets at the school and a contractor was on site earlier this month, but has left. “We haven’t received any communication from the department. We want toilets to be built here so our children can be safe,” he said. “We’ll suspend classes until MEC Fundile Gade brings a contractor to build the toilets.” Tolakele said more than 600 pupils were forced to relieve themselves in the open. Apart from the toilets, some classrooms are leaking and the school yard is not fenced.

It’s even worse for girls as they’re in danger of being raped. We need a proper school,” said the pupil. The gogo of the pupil who fell into the pit toilet said her grandson was still traumatised. “He got home covered in dirt and blood was coming out of his nose. He needs counselling,” she said.
