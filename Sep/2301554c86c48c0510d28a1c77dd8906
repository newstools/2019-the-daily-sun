While the country battles gender-based violence and campaigning for end to it, celebrity couple Mome and Tall A$$ Mo have never gotten into a physical fight despite many disagreements. This was the sentiment Mome shared on her Instagram page, saying that in their marriage of over 10 years, her husband had never raised his hand on her. "My uncle said do you guys ever fight ?? I said always but not physically (in almost 10years my husband has never laid his hand on me) We fight with love and kindness even in the heat of an argument we love each other , it sounds impossible cause emotions can arise ?? but we learn as we grow," She wrote. She said her uncle wanted to know how they fight kindly and she answered: "Me, it's possible if u love the person u are with unconditionally.The disagreements and misunderstandings should not alter your love & respect for each other. The aim is to build each other not break each other.Â Marriage is work but you must enjoy doing it for life with your partner just add patience and grace". My uncle said do you guys ever fight ??
