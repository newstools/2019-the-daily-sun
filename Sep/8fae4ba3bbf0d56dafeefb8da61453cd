American comedian stand-up comedian, actor, and producer Kevin
Hart is reportedly able to walk again. This after being involved in a horrific car accident last
weekend. Hart was a passenger in his 1970 Plymouth Barracuda when car
driven by filmmaker Jared Black driving lost control and plunged into a ditch.  He had a major spinal cord surgery following the crash. He is reportedly taking baby steps, after his doctors were
quick to begin physical and occupational therapy following his back injury. According to POPCULTURE.COM sources close to Hart
said that he is not doing quite as well as fellow comedian Tiffany Haddish had
made it seem on Friday. Haddish spoke to Entertainment Tonight at the Harper's Bazaar
ICONS event in New York City, but Hart's team felt that she had overstated his
condition.
