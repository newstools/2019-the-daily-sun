BLACK Leopards appointed coach Luc Eymael on Wednesday in a bid to move away from the bottom. The former Free State Stars and Polokwane City mentor joined Lidoda Duvha on a two-year deal following a stint with Egyptian side Tala'ea El Gaish Sporting Club. He will replace Lionel Soccoia who was shown the door a week ago following a poor start to the season which saw Leopards win just one match in five outings. Eymael left Ea Lla Koto at the end of 2017/18 season having guided them to lift the Nedbank Cup and finish the season in sixth position. “We have appointed Eymael as coach of Black leopards for a period of two seasons,” said Leopards boss Tshifhiwa Thidiela during the media briefing. Eymael said: “I want to thank the board of Black Leopards and the family for the chance they gave me to come back to South Africa. Some people appreciate, some don’t appreciate (his return). "We were already in touch when I was in Egypt, they knew I was not very happy where I was. I finished my contract at the end of season, but I didn’t want to continue there.” Eymael says it will be tough for opponents to get results in Thohoyandou. “It’s tough to play in Thohoyandou and it’s strength I hope to deliver (results).”
