A MAN was arrested by Mogwadi police on the R521 road in Limpopo after he was found in possession of stolen goods. The suspect was allegedly found in possession of a TV set, a generator and housebreaking equipment when cops stopped the vehicle he was driving on Friday morning. The 40-year-old suspect was with three alleged accomplices, who escaped when police stopped the car. Their whereabouts are unknown. Mogwadi police spokesman Captain Phuti Morema told the People’s Paper the suspect was charged with driving a stolen car, possession of stolen goods, and being in the country without valid papers . Morema said the suspect claimed someone had lent him the car. But police investigations revealed the car was stolen in Makhado, Limpopo, in July. “We’re still going to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter to strengthen our case,” he said. The suspect was expected to appear in the Morebeng Magistrates Court soon.
