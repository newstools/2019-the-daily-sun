HIGHLANDS Park striker Rodney “Rama-G” Ramagalela says he is happy at the rate in which his new Tembisa team is progressing, and he believes their coach Owen Da Gama is destined for greater things. “We are happy with the way we have started the season,” said the former Mamelodi Sundowns and Black Leopards player. “But I think there is still room for improvement as the season progresses. I am sure we will collect more points this season.” In their opening four PSL matches so far, the Tembisa team have collected five points – won one game, drew two and lost one to Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs. Highlands are still in the MTN8 semi-finals after defeating Orlando Pirates 1-0 in the Wafa Wafa quarter-finals. They played to a goalless draw with Polokwane City in the first leg of their semi-final at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. The return leg is scheduled for Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium on 17 September, as they compete for a place in the final, either against Mamelodi Sundowns or SuperSport United. The 30-year-old Mamvuka-born star said he was also pleased to face his former team for the first time. Ramagalela left City this season in a controversial way after he was banned from training with the team for five months. This was after he signed pre-contract with Highlands in January this year. “It was good to be back,” added Ramagalela. “City fans welcomed me and they never booed me like Leopards fans did after I left them. I felt at home “But I was not even nervous to face City for the first time. City are not like Sundowns. With all due respect, City are a small team so I’m okay and I can’t be nervous.”
