The body of Zimbabwe's founding father Robert Mugabe has left the Blur Roof residence, headed to the Rufaro Stadium. This is where thousands of Zimbabweans are waiting to pay their last respects. As thousands of people also paid their last respects on social media, they also made it a point to criticize and admire Mugabe’s Harare private house dubbed the ‘Blue Roof’. The ‘Blue Roof’ is a 25-bedroom house that was reportedly built by a Serbian construction company. The house has two swimming pools in its 44-acre land and is topped by a Chinese-style roof clad. It didn’t take long for South African’s to start comparing the lavish ‘Blue Roof’ to the former South African president’s house in Nkandla. “Robert Mugabe's Blue Roof might be bigger than Nkandla, but there's one thing presidents have in common that the two pictures shows us. That it's all about themselves and their families first and not the people. Imagine how much is being spend in maintaining these places,” people said on Twitter. Another user said: “There's nothing that says v***sek more effectively to the Zimbabwean poor like this Blue Roof compound!”
