TWO bodies were found in open spaces in different places in and around Soweto on Monday. Constable Dakalo Phemula said one body was found in an open space between Tladi and Naledi. The other was found at a dumpsite in Devland. “We received a complaint from a passerby that he came across a body at the dumpsite. “We later received a similar case in Naledi of an unknown dead man aged between 35 and 40.” This came days after Daily Sun reported on the murder of a 15-year-old found dead under Naledi Bridge. Cops tracked and bust the suspects. Phemula said the body found recently in Naledi had stab wounds on the upper body, and details of the murder were still sketchy. “The man was dressed in brown trousers and blue shirt with a black jacket. A case of murder was opened at Naledi cop shop.” No one had been bust for the recent case. Anyone who might have information is urged to contact Naledi police at 011 527 8600 or phone 08600 10111.
