A 21-year-old woman has been arrested after allegedly deserting
her three-day old baby in a pit toilet in George, police said on Wednesday.  A passer-by was visiting Nelson Mandela Village in
Thembalethu on Tuesday afternoon when he stumbled upon the naked baby boy, said
Captain Malcolm Pojie.  The man phoned the police station and officers rushed to the
scene while also calling paramedics.  "By the time the discovery was made, the baby boy was
already suffering from trauma and hypothermia. He was immediately transported
to hospital where he was admitted for emergency medical treatment," said
Pojie.  "The vigilance of the witness has definitively saved
the boy from certain death."  READ: Eastern Cape dad finds dead baby in box in daughter's

shredded pieces of what appeared to be a birth certificate.  When they arrived at the family home, residents had already
"apprehended" the mother and then handed her over to police.  Pojie said that according to medical records, the woman gave
birth to her son at George Hospital on Sunday.  They were discharged on Tuesday.  "Thereafter, they went home and seemingly the mother
deserted the boy of only three days old in the pit toilet."  She is expected to appear in the George Magistrate's Court
on Thursday on charges of attempted murder and child neglect.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/newborn-baby-found-naked-in-pit-toilet-mom-arrested-20190918
