2019 Nedbank Ke Yona Team players will embark on trials with
16 Premier Soccer League side in a bid to follow in the footsteps of Aubrey
Modiba and Bongani Sam who graduated via the talent search program. The 16 players played their first match together on Sunday at
Kameelrivier Stadium in Mpumalanga when they lost 2-1 to Nedbank Cup Champions
TS Galaxy who lifted the Ke Yona Challenge trophy. They will have a month-long trial that could make their
dreams of becoming professional players come true or break them as they will
return home to continue with their normal lives. Modiba is a 2015 graduate of the Ke Yona Team Search,
however he made his mark in the professional ranks with SuperSport United the
following year. And since then he never looked back as he went on to represent
South Africa during the 2016 Olympics in Rio Brazil, while he also gained seven
caps with Bafana Bafana. The 24-year-old has also tasted continental football
having helped Matsatsantsa A Pitori reach the Caf Confederation Cup final where
they lost 2-1 on aggregate to Democratic Republic of Congo side TP Mazembe in
2017.  Meanwhile, Samâ€™s (2017 graduate) rise to stardom was also
quick having made his debut with Bloemfontein Celtic, represented Bafana in the
Cosafa Cup and joined Soweto giants Orlando Pirates after just one season in
the top flight is a remarkable achievement. He made 24 appearances for Siwelele across all competitions during the 2018/19 season and scored two
goals. This proves that anything is possible if you work hard and
put your mind to it.
