THERE are no-go areas for thugs. Not even top cops can duck their dreaded tentacles. On 14 September, national police commissioner General Khehla Sitole became a victim of crime when tsotsis stole two TV sets from his Mpumalanga home. His spokesman, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, said Sitole’s home was still under construction when the theft happened. He said the commissioner was attending a summit in Cape Town when the theft took place. “Nothing else in the house was stolen, and there was actually no break-in,” he said. Social media users shared their thoughts on crime in the country.
