cops are urging Uber and Taxify drivers to be careful in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Captain Lowllan West of Khayelitsha cop shop said on Monday at 10.20pm, an Uber driver was robbed on Baloyi Street in site B. “The driver received a call to meet a client in R Block. The client got into the vehicle and the driver saw three unknown men approaching with firearms,” said West. West said when he tried to drive off, the client grabbed the steering wheel and forced him to stop the car. “The other three men then pointed a firearm at him and demanded his white Toyota Avanza. They also took his cellphone,” he said. West said Taxify drivers and delivery trucks were also being targeted in the kasi. He said most truck companies were using security guards to escort drivers. Nomanono Mlunguza (46) said thugs were preventing the kasi from developing. “That’s why most people don’t like our areas. It’s because of criminals robbing them. I won’t be surprised if these companies decided to stop coming to Khayelitsha,” she said.
