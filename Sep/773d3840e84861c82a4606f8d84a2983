THE family claims Correctional Services didn’t tell them their loved one was dead. David Monnakgotla (43) from White City, Soweto, was being held at Kutama Sinthumule Prison. David died on 26 August but his family allegedly only learnt of it from an inmate’s brother. David’s niece Mpho (38) told Daily Sun: “I wonder if we were ever going to find out.” David’s sister Mantwa Mazibuko (65) said it was sad to receive such news: they didn’t even know something was wrong. “I called the prison after I received the news to ask the cause of death,” said Mantwa. “I was told he was sick, but the next day I was told he had a stroke. “When his body was brought home by the undertaker, there was no sign of a stroke.” Mantwa claimed David had a nosebleed. “I placed my finger inside his nose, only to find some bloodied cloth inside. “When I called the prison, they said he vomited the whole night before he died.” Mantwa wanted Correctional Services to be truthful so they could be at peace. Department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said David came to the centre in 2006. He was sentenced to 78 years for rape, housebreaking, theft and kidnapping. “He died at 8.30pm on 26 August at a healthcare facility after he was admitted on 14 August after collapsing. “He died of natural causes as a result of a stroke and hypertension. “A family friend was called on 27 August after failure to find next of kin.”
