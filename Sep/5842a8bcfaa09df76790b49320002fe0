Nicholas Ninow,
the man who pleaded guilty to raping a 7-year-old girl in the bathroom of a
Dros restaurant in Pretoria in 2018, has officially been found guilty. At the start of
his trial last week, Ninow pleaded guilty to two charges of rape as well as
charges of defeating the ends of justice and the possession of an illegal
substance. But he pleaded not guilty to assault. The State also withdrew a
kidnapping charge. But the State
rejected his guilty pleas on the basis that aspects of his story contradicted
the State's evidence. As a result, the trial proceeded. Handing down
judgment on Monday, Judge Mokhine Mosopa found Ninow guilty of rape and
accepted the State's version of events. "The only
reasonable inference the court can draw is that the accused saw the victim
playing in the play area, saw her going to the bathroom, followed her and then
undressed and raped her," Mosopa said. Ninow was also
found guilty of possession of drugs, and defeating the ends of justice He was found not
guilty of assault. In the trial,
which took four days to complete, the State called six witnesses, including the
victim, focusing on the sequence of events. Ninow's Legal Aid lawyer Herman
Alberts closed his case without calling any witnesses. While he admitted
raping the victim, by forcing his penis into her mouth and inserting his
fingers into her vagina, he claimed the victim found him in the bathroom and
that he acted impulsively. In his plea
explanation, he said he went to the women's bathroom to snort the drug CAT because
he was afraid of being caught. But the State
disputed this, saying Ninow planned the assault and preyed on the victim,
following her into the bathroom. News24 previously
reported that the mother of the victim had found Ninow naked in the bathroom with
her daughter.  SOURCE: NEWS24
