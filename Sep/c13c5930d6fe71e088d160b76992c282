THE families of seven people who died in a horror car crash on Friday will identify their remains today. They died on the N1 between Pumulani Plaza and Walmansthal in Soshanguve, Tshwane. Tshwane emergency services spokesman deputy chief Charles Mabaso said two trucks and eight cars were involved in the accident. He said one truck was completely burnt out, while the other was partially burnt after emergency services put out the fire.  “One car was trapped underneath the truck and completely burnt down, with two occupants burnt beyond recognition.” Mabaso said a woman with light injuries and a man with moderate injuries were treated and taken to hospital. “The accident may have been caused by poor visibility due to grass fires in the area,” he said. Two adults, a child and a toddler were burnt beyond recognition after their car was trapped under a truck.  Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said seven people were killed and three were seriously injured. “We encourage road users to obey all road rules and be responsible at all times,” he said. He instructed the Road Traffic Management Corporation to work with the police to investigate the crash and the Road Accident Fund to help the families of the victims. Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo urged motorists to always keep a safe distance to avoid deadly accidents. Tshwane Metro Police spokesman Isaac Mahamba also said the crash was suspected to have been caused by smoke from veld fires.
