FORMER Kaizer Chiefs striker Fani Madida says his record of scoring the most goals domestically in 1991 should have long been surpassed. He said the problem why it has stood for this long is because coaches in the PSL are afraid to introduce youngsters. Madida was not the tallest of strikers but he had a nose for goals alongside his deadly strike partner Shane McGregor. On their way to winning then Castle League title in 1991, Madida netted 34 goals for Chiefs, 28 coming in the league. Amakhosi beat Mamelodi Sundowns to the title by four points in the then 18-team league. The other goal from Madida, who hails from Madadeni, Newcastle in KwaZulu, came in the final of the Castle Challenge when they defeated 2-1 Orlando Pirates. For his exploits, Madida was then named Player of the Season. “I’m actually not impressed that no one has broken it because there’s an abundance of talent in South Africa,” said Madida in his foundation launch of Didiza34 in Sandton on Tuesday. The number 34 from the name of his foundation represents the amount of goals he scored during his finest season 28 years ago. “If we give a chance to the new generation of players, we would have got Fani Madida now who would have surpassed that record, but unfortunately the coaches are not so brave to use the youngsters.” To put this into perspective, Collins Mbesuma’s tally of 35 he netted for Chiefs in 2004-05, some of those were scored in the Caf Champions League, 25 in the league and the other came in other domestic competitions.
