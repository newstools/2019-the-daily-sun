EVERY petrol-head
loves the adrenaline you get when going sideways. Well it’s
not any other day that you expect to see an SUV out on the track going sideways,
but BMW have released a video of a heavily camouflaged X6 M or is it an X6 M Competition. Just three
months ago company launched the X6, but the M division has already toyed with
the SUV gave it more power. According
to the BMWBLOG, the X6 will probably use the S63 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 mill
which used in the F90 M5. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. WATCH: Driver reverses BMW i8 over pond, hedge and into wall A Joburg driver was left devastated after she crashed a BMW i8 into the neighbour's wall. The
all-wheel drive system and the gearbox will be shared as well but, just like on
the X3 M model, you most likely won’t be able to turn your X6 M into a
rear-wheel drive only car.
