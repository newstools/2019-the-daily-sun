YANGA Dyantyi has appealed to anyone living with a disability not to be ashamed of their condition. The 31-year-old mum of two from Khayelitsha in Cape Town is blind. She told Daily Sun she became blind 10 years ago after she was invited to a friend’s 21st birthday party. “One of my friends spiked my drink. I heard she had planned to make me very drunk,” said Yanga. She lost her eyesight after the incident. “It was difficult at first because my life changed completely. But I told myself I’d never allow living with a disability to ruin my life.” She’s at present undergoing a smart digital course at the Cape Society for the Blind. Before attending the course, she worked as a floor manager at a Phambili VIP Bangane protective workshop. “People living with a disability must do what they love,” she said. “Our situations won’t change just because we feel sorry for ourselves.” Yanga said the support from her family and others was what kept her going. “I’ve learnt that forgiveness is important and makes you happy. I forgave the person who did this to me,” she said. Yanga said she did everything for herself – from washing to cooking and getting her son ready for school. “I might be blind but I do everything myself. I wake up early every day to prepare my child for school, and you can’t tell everything was done by a blind mother,” she said. She urged people living with disabilities to use their gifts.
