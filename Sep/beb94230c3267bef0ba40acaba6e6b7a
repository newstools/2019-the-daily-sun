PUPILS allegedly missed out on writing exams, all thanks to a knife! They were then made to write two exam papers in a day to catch up. To add to this, 28 grade 10 pupils allegedly did not get timetables.  This came after pupils from Setlopo High School in Mahikeng, North West, were suspended last Tuesday. They were suspended after the class was raided and one of the pupils was found with a knife. According to parents, the principal suspended the whole class in the middle of exams, saying they were bullies and troublesome. Three parents who spoke to Daily Sun said their children were punished for something they did not do. They said the school should have suspended the boy found with the knife instead of the whole class. READ: PICS: BABSIE IS HOME AFTER YEARS IN THAI JAIL “My daughter did not have a knife on her. Now she is forced to go through this hardship. I am scared she might fail because of this,” said one father. Another parent said the department of education should force the school to give all affected pupils a pass as they violated the rights of pupils who were not at fault. “How do they expect the children to pass if they refuse to give them timetables to prepare? “They only know what they will be writing when the exam paper lands on their desks. This is so unfair,” he said. A teacher at the school said the class that was suspended was full of bullies. “They bully us. Some even sleep during lessons. We are afraid of these children. We are not safe and it’s making it hard for us to teach,” he said. North West education department spokesman, Elias Malindi said he would talk to relevant managers about the matter.
