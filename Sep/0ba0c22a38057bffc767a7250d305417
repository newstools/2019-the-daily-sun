RETAILERS make a huge difference in helping with the rife unemployment in Mzansi. Graduates who struggle to find jobs have turned to retail for survival and are doing well. Senzo Dlamini (28) from Zakariyya Park, south of Joburg, is a graduate who works at a big retail store. Retail is one of the few sectors that registered employment growth in the first half of the year. Senzo told SunEducation that after many years of job hunting, he turned to retail. And now he’s the breadwinner in his family. “The job is not what I studied for, but I realised I might wait my whole life for the right job. “So I got off my high horse and applied for a job. I work as a manager in retail now.” Senzo said his skills and qualifications helped him to get a managerial position. “Waiting for the right job might not work,” he said. “I encourage young people to consider taking whatever comes their way while waiting for their choices because time waits for no man.” who form part of their skills development and training. In the first quarter, the number of jobs in the sector increased by 0.8% compared to the same period in 2018. In the 2018/2019 financial year, the Shoprite Group created 3 175 jobs, and 90% of those are filled by people under the age of 34. Zakhele Sibiya, chief human resources officer, said this philosophy is underpinned by a strong focus on skills development., as training empowers employees, develops their skills, and keeps the workforce abreast of changing industry trends. “This is especially important as technology catalyses quicker change and disruption in the already-disrupted retail industry,” he said.
