STUDENTS and workers at Sefako Makgatho Health Science University in Ga-Rankuwa north of Tshwane were left frightened on Monday. This was after they were quickly evacuated from the premises by the police over an alleged bomb threat. According to Ga-Rankuwa police spokesman, Captain Mathews Nkoadi, they received an anonymous tip off that there was a bomb threat in the facility. He said they had to rush and evacuate everyone.“The tip we got didn’t mention the name of the person who had or planted the bomb it only said a student,” he said. He said when they got to the university they called the bomb squad, who swiftly searched for it but they couldn’t find anything. “A bomb threat is a serious issue. “Although we didn’t find anything we will continue to monitor the university and also investigate where the tip off came from,” he said. Nkoadi said they have deployed cops who will keep guard of any unusual activity until they are certain that indeed there is no bomb threat. “We have opened a case of a bomb threat and we will continue to investigate this matter thoroughly,” he said. This was the second bomb threat in Tshwane in a space of a week. Last Tuesday a 55-year-old man was arrested after a bomb threat at the Menlyn Maine shopping centre in the east of Tshwane.According to the police an unknown man in his 50s entered a bank at the shopping centre. Police spokeswoman, Captain Colette Weilbach, said the man handed a note over to the bank teller who assisted him, the note contained a threat to say that there is a bomb planted inside the bank.
