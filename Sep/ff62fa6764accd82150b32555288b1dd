FORMER US vice-president Joe Biden, a front runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, on Saturday called for a probe into reports that President Donald Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate him. “To get on the phone with a foreign leader who’s looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things … this is outrageous,” a visibly angry Biden said while campaigning in Iowa. “Trump is using this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum.” Trump’s 25 July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is at the centre of an escalating battle over a whistleblower’s complaint reportedly concerning the US leader’s dealings with Ukraine that the administration has refused to give Congress. The Wall Street Journal  on Friday reported that Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate unsubstantiated charges that Biden, while vice-president, threatened to withhold US aid unless a prosecutor who was looking into a gas company, in which Biden’s son was involved, was fired. – REUTERS
