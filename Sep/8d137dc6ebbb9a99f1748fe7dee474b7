PARENTS are encouraged to teach their kids good values. Plant The Seed is a saving group of parents who go the extra mile in educating kids about saving and starting businesses in their teens. Grade 9 pupil Mpho Phiti (14), who currently stays in Randfontein, on the West Rand, owns two cows in her home village Mathopestad, in North West. “Thanks to the advice of my father, Phineas Phiti,” said Mpho.  Phineas (50) told SunStokvel: “My two kids have their own livestock and this makes me proud.” One of Plant The Seed members, Cynthia Phiti, a teacher at a local school in Kagiso, on the West Rand, shared her pride. “The club is about bonding and teaching children about the future.  The children said: “We were taught to save money from as little as R10. We save money to pledge at church and for outdoor games as a family. “During the festive season we go to our village in Mathopeng to hike and braai at the mountain and spend the whole day as a family. “Today we are part of fun walk organised by the Methodist Church of South Africa here in Mathopeng.”” “We are staying at Randfontein near Joburg but here in Mathopeng is a peaceful home.”
