NOTHING about us without us. This is the attitude residents and business people seemingly adopted after seeing a road maintenance project taking off in their area without their knowledge. Members of the ward 3 Local Business Forum and residents of Nottingham in Umgeni, KZN, yesterday marched to the project’s site and demanded work be stopped until local business people were sub-contracted and youth employed. Forum secretary Sifundo Mchunu told Daily Sun business people only got to know about the project earlier last month when they saw a noticeboard with the information. They called an urgent meeting with Councillor Sandile Sibiya on 8 August to get clarity. “The councillor told us he didn’t know anything about the project,” said Mchunu. He said the project didn’t meet the requirements, which clearly stated that locals should be given preference for jobs and sub-contracts. “When we arrived at the site, local business people were given forms to apply for work. “But our intention was to stop the project immediately. We don’t trust this because the forms don’t have a stamp on them,” he said. Resident Sabelo Makhathini (34) said: “People from other areas told us they were hired to work on the project. We don’t understand how they employed outsiders while we, the locals, are unemployed.” He said they would stop the project, should they not be employed. Thando Mgaga, a spokesman for Umgeni Municipality, said the road in question was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transport and not that of the municipality.
