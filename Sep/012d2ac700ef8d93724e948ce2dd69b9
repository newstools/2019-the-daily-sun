AN angry mum wants her child’s scholar transport driver to rot in jail. The man allegedly raped her three-year-old daughter on her way from pre-school last Thursday. The 27-year-old mum from Peace Valley in Pietermaritzburg discovered the incident on the same day. She cannot be named to protect the identity of the child. “My daughter came home from pre-school looking more tired than usual. She changed and went straight to sleep,” said the mum. “She woke up at about 9pm and told me her private parts were painful. I asked her if she was injured and she said umalume inserted his 4-5 into her that afternoon.” The mum took the child to Edendale Hospital, where nurses confirmed she’d been raped. After making a statement at the hospital’s care centre, she hoped an arrest would be made immediately, but the man was still roaming the streets days after that. “On Tuesday, I discovered a case was opened only on that day. Officials at the care centre said they had submitted the information at Plessislaer cop shop but the police insisted it was not handed over immediately,” she said. KZN police confirmed a man was arrested and would appear in court soon.
