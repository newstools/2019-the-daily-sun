Kgothatso Montjane's hopes of a first Grand Slam success were crushed in defeat in the US Open women's wheelchair doubles final on Sunday at Flushing Meadows in New York. The 33-year-old from Limpopo and her German partner Sabine Ellerbrock lost 6-2, 6-0 in a comprehensive defeat at the hands of Dutch pair Diede de Groot and Aniek van Koot. Montjane has competed at all four Grand Slam tournaments, but fell agonisingly short again, having also suffered a Wimbledon semi-final defeat in July. She was eliminated in the opening round of the singles competition on Sunday to end all South African participation at the final Grand Slam event of the year. - Tennis SA
