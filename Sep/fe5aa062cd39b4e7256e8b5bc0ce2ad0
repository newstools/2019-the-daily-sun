Genital Dialogue exhibition for pads. This was a sexuality and intimacy exhibition which took place yesterday afternoon at Pretoria. The event was hosted by Blunt Moya, in partnership with Capital Arts and U-The Space which presented the final leg of the #GenitalDialogue exhibition. Blunt said the Genital Dialogue is about an artistic and alternative perspective on human genitals to highlight the uniqueness of each individual. “The project focuses on issues of genital shaming, which often leaves one embarrassed and with low self-esteem, understanding preferences regarding circumcision and non-circumcision, stigmas around the question "does size matter?" while breaking the boundaries to understand sex, intimacy and sexuality,” said Blunt. Showcasing since May 2019 across the Gauteng province, #GenitalDialogue is a photography and sculpture exhibition, a cohesive collaboration between Pretoria's photographer Moya and sculpture Angie Malay. Talking to Daily Sun, Blunt said the purpose of the exhibition is to reopen a social discourse around an issue that is often sensitised so people can see and talk about it in its purest and most raw form. “To close off the show on Saturday, guests were also invited to donate sanitary pads, which would be donated to school girls during a femicide talk,” he said. “We want to further make a difference to the lives of young girls by using this project to assist them in giving out sanitary pads and raising awareness on abuse and how to protect themselves," he added.
