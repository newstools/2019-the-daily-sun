KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has been impressed by Leonardo Castro's good attitude that he has been showing. Castro, who’s career at Naturena was up in the air during the off season, could not have asked for the better showing to signal to the club that he will be useful this season. The Colombian striker scored when Chiefs won 2-0 against AmaZulu at King Zwelithini Stadium on Tuesday to return top of the Absa Premiership table. In the 84th minute, the former Mamelodi Sundowns striker reacted quickly to tuck home the opening goal after Lebogang Manyana’s free kick crashed to the upright before it felt kindly to him. “Castro is a special player,” said Middendorp. “He has been fantastic in the last 13 days of training and that is the reason why I preferred him instead of Lazalous Kambole.” Castro entrance was necessitated after Samir Nurkovic was taken off in the 43rd minutes after the Serbian striker was involved in the clash of heads with Usuthu defender Tshepo Gumede. “I’m very happy for him (Castro),” Middendorp added. “Personally he has good character, he’s definitely contributing to the team effort in a very positive way. “ I’m quite happy that he was the one who tucked in the first goal. I think it is not only me who is happy, but the attitude we have in the team at the moment. “I think all the players are very happy to see Leonardo scoring his first goal.” It was 30-year-old’s second appearance this season. His first appearance was the start against Black Leopards on 10 August at Moses Mabhida Stadium before he was taken off before the second half got underway. This was also Castro’s first goal this season. He last scored in 2-0 victory over Bidvest Wits on the 9 January.
