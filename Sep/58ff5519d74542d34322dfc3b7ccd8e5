WITH the world becoming more obsessed with SUVS the desire for multi-purpose vehicles (MPvs) are declining. But that didn’t stop Mercedes replacing its B-Class MPV with a brand-new derivative, which SunWheels just tested in B200 AMG-line guise. The German carmaker replaced the B-Class in South Africa in August and despite its mommy-car credentials it is actually quite funky with a lot of spunk!  Basically if you like the sporty A-Class but need more space the B-Class is a great option! The reason is that it shares much of its genes with the A-Class such as it chassis and engines but in a bigger body. And what is more is that the B-Class doesn’t look dull and in fact features similar design cues to that of the A-Class. Inside, the dashboard is smart and futuristic with Merc’s MBUX infotainment system which is one of the best in the business when it comes to in-car connectivity. Behind the wheel the B-Class it is really easy to forget you’re not driving the A-Class. There is a sportiness to the overall driving experience but passengers sit a little higher, givin the driver a clearer view of the road ahead. Under the B200’s engine is the same 1,3-litre turbocharged petrol engine of the A200 with 120 kW and 250 Nm, mated to a slick seven-speed automatic gearbox. Mercedes-Benz claims a combined fuel economy of 5,6 litres/100 km. Though family car buyers might lean towards buying an SUV when in the market for new wheels, the B-Class makes a strong case for itself. With little competition left in the MPV segment it stands out too, while you could just imagine you are driving your family around in snazzy hot hatch – after all, Merc refers to it as a “sports tourer”.
