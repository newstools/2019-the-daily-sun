AS THINGS stand, there is very little hope that the 27-year-old Zimbabwean mum will get her six-year-old son back from social workers. Her boy was taken to a place of safety in 2017 after she and her boyfriend were bust for shoplifting in Groblersdal Mall. The boy has still not been released to his mum although all the processes have been conducted by social workers. The woman from Extension 44, outside Polokwane, said the DNA tests done in January prove that the boy is her son, but social workers threaten her. “They say they will deport my child to Zimbabwe. I never abandoned my son. It was my ex-boyfriend who committed the crime,” she said. “My son was still a baby when he was taken. He’s growing up without his mother. I want him here and reunited with his relatives.” Witness Tiva of the Limpopo Department of Social Development said they were investigating. “We are worried about the allegations made by the mother that her child will be deported. Any alleged wrongdoing by our social workers will also be taken into consideration.”
