CONCERNED models spent the day at the Union Buildings in Tshwane showing what abusive men did to women. The young women said they were touched by incidents of abuse all over the country. One of the models who was part of the demonstration, Katlego Tlokana (19) from Mahube in Mamelodi East, Tshwane told Daily Sun: “The day was about gender-based violence, focusing on what is happening in the country and the world.” She said the demonstration and the photoshoot was directed at perpetrators who kill, rape and abuse. Katlego said she was motivated by women who had the courage to tell their stories of abuse and those who were still standing strong after being raped. “Gender-based violence is a phenomenon deeply rooted in gender inequality. I feel as if we have been neglected by people close to us. They’re the people who should be protecting us,” she said. Katlego is a theatre actor. She is also a community radio presenter on Mams FM in Mamelodi. She’s an advocate for young people and a member of a children’s radio foundation. Kay Dreams Media Company manager Kagiso Lepadima told Daily Sun: “Through our photoshoot we’re doing what we can to fight gender-based violence in the country. We decided to show our support through a photoshoot.” Kagiso said they’d start shooting a drama about gender-based violence at the end of the month. “I trust that pictures can tell a story better,” he said. He said people can follow their pictures and videos on Facebook, Twitter, instagram and YouTube.
