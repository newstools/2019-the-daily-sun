A MUM is fuming after her daughter (16) was allegedly raped by a teacher. The incident happened in Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Friday. The mum (37) claimed the teacher confessed to raping her daughter and tried to bribe them not to involve cops. The mum told Daily Sun her daughter, a grade 11 pupil, told cops she was with her classmates when the teacher called her. “He locked the classroom’s spare room and forced her to watch a porn video on his cellphone. The next thing he raped her,” said the mum. “She said when he finished, he threatened to post a video he shot if she talked.” The mum said after realising he was in trouble, the teacher confessed to raping the pupil. “He and his homeboys offered to compensate us for the damage they caused if we didn’t involve the police.” She called the cops and he was arrested on Friday. “I was so humiliated when school management tried to protect him, even after the hospital confirmed she was raped,” said the mum. Mpumalanga Eeducation spokesman Jasper Zwane said: “We condemn the alleged incident in the strongest terms possible. We’re encouraged after the police acted swiftly to apprehend the suspect.” Zwane said the matter was also taken to the South African Council for Educators to ensure the teacher’s conduct was investigated. “He’ll be struck off the roll should it be found that he transgressed as alleged.” Police spokesman Captain Mpho Nonyane confirmed that a 26-year-old suspect was arrested and would formally apply for bail on 17 October.
