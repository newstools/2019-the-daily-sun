Former Orlando Pirates head coach Milutin Sredojevic on Sunday won his first trophy with Egyptian side Zamalek, just two weeks after his appointment. Zamalek were crowned Egypt Cup champions as Sredojevic guided his new side to an emphatic 3-0 win over Pyramids at the Borg El Arab Stadium, on Sunday. Youssef 'Obama' opened the scoring in the 51st minute before Achraf Bencharki scored a brace to ensure victory for the White Knights who lifted the trophy for the second consecutive season - and the 27th time in the club's history. Sredojevic was delighted with the victory after the final whistle and took to Twitter to thank the club's fans and his technical team. He went on to say that it was his 16th major trophy in Africa since 2001. In contrast, Orlando Pirates have failed to win a major trophy since lifting the Nedbank Cup in 2014. With the only accolade being the fan-driven 2019 Carling Black Label Cup in the 2019/2020 curtain-raiser. The Buccaneers have just one win from six matches in all competitions since Sredojevic's departure and sit in 10th position in the league standings - five points behind pace-setters Kaizer Chiefs. https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/micho-wins-first-trophy-with-zamalek-20190909
