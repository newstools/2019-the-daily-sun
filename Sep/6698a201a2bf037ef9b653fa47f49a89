JOACHIM Loew’s resurgent Germany side face their first test without Manchester City winger Leroy Sane when they renew their rivalry with neighbours, the Netherlands, in tonight’s Euro 2020 qualifier in Hamburg. The 23-year-old Sane is one of several German players missing through injury, including Julian Draxler and Thilo Kehrer, after he tore knee ligaments during City’s Community Shield win over Liverpool last month. The twinkle-toed winger has been a key part of the national team’s recovery from their World Cup debacle last year, scoring in five of Germany’s last six games. Two of those goals have come against tonight’s opponents the Netherlands, whom Germany have faced three times since last October in a resumption of one of international football’s biggest rivalries. Yet, Sane’s teammates insisted this week that they would be able to compensate for his absence. “Leroy creates a lot of space and is very important for the team, but we have a lot of quality to replace him,” said Borussia Dortmund player Marco Reus. Sane is expected to be replaced by in-form RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner. “Leroy’s unfortunate injury means there is space in attack. I believe I can show the same performances here as I have for my club,” said Werner, who has scored five goals in three games for Leipzig this season. Having twice failed to beat the Dutch in the Nations League last year, Germany’s 3-2 win in Amsterdam in March marked a change in fortunes and left them six points clear of their rivals in qualifying Group C. Victory in Hamburg would therefore represent a huge step towards qualification, adding further spice to the cross-border derby. “Games against the Netherlands are always big. You stand on the pitch and think: ‘awesome’,” said Reus. – AFP
