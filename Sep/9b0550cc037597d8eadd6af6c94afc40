THERE’S nothing as satisfying as seeing your hard work pay off. Investigating officer Sergeant Zenzile Morudu said she was proud after a suspect she investigated was sentenced to life on Monday for raping a 21-year-old woman. Nicholas Mariri was also sentenced to another eight years for housebreaking and another 20 years for armed robbery. Morudu said Mariri and two accomplices broke into a house in Selcourt in Springs, Ekurhuleni in 2017, and loaded stolen appliances into the victim’s Toyota Etios. But before leaving, two of the three suspects gang-raped a woman whom they found sleeping in the house. The car was later found dumped in the area with all the stolen goods gone. Mariri was later bust in Tshwane and his DNA tested positively in the rape of the Selcourt woman. On Tuesday, the Springs Regional Court handed down the sentence. In another case, Detective Constable Edmond Lebopo of Ivory Park was proud that a local taxi guard was sentenced to 18 years on Monday after he had killed a fellow taxi guard two years ago. He fled to KZN but was later bust. The South Gauteng High Court sitting in Joburg found Sabelo Sithole (36) guilty of the murder of Thobelani Mchunu. Sithole was sentenced to 18 years for murder, five years for attempted murder, and five years for illegal possession of an unlicensed firearm. Captain Bernard Matimulane said the sentences would run concurrently. “He was also declared unfit to possess an firearm,” he said. Matimulane said Mchunu and Sithole were colleagues who worked as taxi guards at Ivory Park extension 2 at the time. “They got into an argument and Sithole produced a gun and shot him dead and fled. “Two years later, Lebopo learnt of his whereabouts and he was bust,” said Matimulane. The Mchunu family said they were happy justice had finally been served. “We are happy our brother will now rest in peace and that his killer is finally behind bars,” they said.
