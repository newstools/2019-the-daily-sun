KAIZER Chiefs defender Eric Mathoho insist that they are not feeling the heat at the top of Absa Premiership table. Amakhosi resume their league schedule with a date against Polokwane City at FNB Stadium on Saturday (6pm). Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns are the only unbeaten side in the league so far this season. The Soweto giants are the first team to reach double figures having collected 10 points in four matches. They are a point ahead of second placed Bidvest Wits and Downs are two points behind them in third spot. Said Mathoho: “Being at the top will push us to work hard for the three point. It won’t be easy, we need to be focused like always. We started well this season, but we can’t take any opponent for granted because we have only played four games. We should stay focused and just do our job, but we don’t feel any pressure." The lanky defender revealed that the support of his teammates and technical staff helped him to regain his form following a long period on the side-lines due to niggling injuries. The 29-year-old is joint top scorer at the club with his teammate Lebogang Manyama on two goals. “Whether you are playing or not we support each other and I feel happy to be a joint to scorer with Lebo. ”However, Mathoho is disappointed that he didn’t get the chance to play for Bafana Bafana as both friendlies against Zambia and Madagascar were cancelled due to violence. “I was not okay after both matches were cancelled.”
