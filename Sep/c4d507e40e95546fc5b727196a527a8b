SWALLOWS FC have wasted little time replacing former coach, Zeca Marques, with whom they parted ways just last week. The Dube Birds appointed former Richards Bay coach Brandon Truter as their new mentor. Truter recently parted ways with the KwaZulu Natal outfit, leaving them in a comfortable third place position in the GladAfrica Championship. He will now be expected to steady the ship at Swallows, who have found the going rather tough in their first season back in Mzansi's second Division. They currently occupy 13th spot on the standings with just four points after five matches. Speaking to SunSport, Truter said he was looking forward to the challenge of coaching one of the oldest clubs in Mzansi and has promised to deliver the goods. "I understand that we are in results driven business. That means i will have to meet all my requirements, we are looking to hopefully secure a play-offs spot," said Truter. Swallows boss David Mogashoa also expressed his delight at having Truter in the Birds' beautiful nest. "We are excited to have a quality coach like Brandon who understands the GladAfrica Championship," said Mogashoa. "We are convinced that he will improve the team."
