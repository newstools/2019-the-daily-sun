 Gauteng
police have arrested eleven heavily armed suspects and recovered seven
firearms. The Gauteng
police spokesman, Captain Masondo said police received information about a
hijacked vehicle with men that were heavily armed. Masondo
told Daily Sun that they acted on the intelligence and the vehicle
matching the description was spotted. “When
realising that they were being followed and monitored, the suspects accelerated,
and chase ensued. Suspects stopped the vehicle, a grey Mercedes Benz, and fled
on foot. The vehicle was searched, and four firearms were recovered,” Masondo
said.  Masindo
also said preliminary investigation revealed that the car was hijacked in
Bramley, last month. Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects. In a separate
incident in Ekurhuleni police arrested eleven suspects aged between 33 and 54
and recovered three firearms. Police
followed two suspicious vehicles, an Audi and Toyota Etios to a house in Birch Acres,
Kempton Park.  As the police were approaching,
the suspects started shooting at the police who returned fire.  “One
suspect was fatally shot during the shootout while 11 suspects were cornered
and arrested. Upon searching the suspects, police found three unlicensed
firearms and ammunition,” said Masondo. “Police
also found eight vehicles suspected to be stolen. It is suspected that the gang
was planning a robbery. The
suspects will appear at Kempton Park Magistrate's court in due course,” he
added.
