ARTIST Ayanda Mabulu has once again come up with a controversial painting. The latest shows former president Nelson Mandela lying naked on the lap of his gun-toting ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. The painting was exhibited at a Braamfontein gallery last week. Ayanda defended the artwork and said it showed Mama Winnie was a victim of gender-based violence at the hands of Mandela. The self-taught Ayanda told Daily Sun the artwork was sparked by the recent spate of violence against women and children. He said he was not afraid of criticism and backlash he might receive for it. “I did my own research and I’m certain Winnie is a victim of women abuse,” said Ayanda. He said the rifle represented Winnie the activist. “She endured the pain in silence. It was very heavy on her but no one dared question Mandela because people looked up to him,” he said. He said he was not worried about death threats. “I have been threatened and pointed with a gun but I will never want to look like a cool artist. My art speaks the truth that people are afraid to tell,” he said. Ayanda received a lot of backlash because of his previous paintings. Last year, Ayanda was arrested outside the JSE after he displayed the work titled Blame It On the Boers. He also painted Mandela doing a Nazi salute, which the Nelson Mandela Foundation found to have been deeply offensive. The foundation had not responded at the time of going to print.
