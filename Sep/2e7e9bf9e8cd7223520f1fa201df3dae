A 31-member South African team has been named to compete at the 2019 IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar from 27 September to 6 October. The squad comprises 26 men and five women. The squad will be led by world champion Luvo Manyonga, who will defend his global title in the men's long jump. This time around however the squad will be without Caster Semenya (800m) and Wayde van Niekerk (400m), who is yet to make a full comeback from a knee injury. In addition, Carina Horn, who was sensationally suspended by the IAAF on Monday for failing a doping test, will not make the trip either. Boosted by some of the country's most experienced track and field stars, Manyonga will be joined by the likes of African long jump champion Ruswahl Samaai, Olympic javelin medalist Sunette Viljoen, world championships 100m finalist Akani Simbine and former world championships 200m medalist Anaso Jobodwana. The squad also features one of SA's most exciting young prospects, world junior champion Zenéy van der Walt, who will compete in the women's 400m hurdles. Simbine, meanwhile, will spearhead a strong men's 4x100m relay team, while the squad also includes a men's 4x400m team which will rely on depth in the absence of Van Niekerk. “We have selected the best team possible and have given them the same mandate we gave two years ago, that is to bring medals. The last team lived up to the challenge and achieved six podium places, bringing home three golds, one silver and two bronze," said Athletics South Africa (ASA) president Aleck Skhosana. South Africa finished third overall in the medal table at the 2017 IAAF World Championships in London when they took home three golds (Manyonga - long jump, Semenya - 800m, Van Niekerk - 400), one silver (Van Niekerk - 200m) and two bronze medals (Samaai - long jump, Semenya - 1 500m). The team leaves for Doha on Tuesday, September 24 from OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg and will return home on Tuesday, October 8.
