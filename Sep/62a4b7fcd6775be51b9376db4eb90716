HIGHLANDS Park have suffered a massive blow. The club has confirmed that Makhehleni Makhaula, who is tough-as-nails, will be out of action for eight months while praying that striker Rodney "RamaG" Ramagalela will be back soon. Makhaula tore the Achilles tendon in his leg in the MTN8 quarter final win over Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on 17 August. This is a huge setback for Makhaula, who had just joined the club during the off season from relegated Free State Stars. “Makhaula, it is eight months. They (Pirates players) kicked his Achilles tendon off his leg so he’s eight months,” confirmed coach Owen da Gama after securing MTN8 final spot defeating Polokwane City 4-3 on penalties on Tuesday. “He had an operation and he’s a long-term out injured.” Striker, Ramagalela suffered a quad muscle injury and did not finish the match as he was withdrawn in the first half against Rise and Shine. These players join the injury list of Sphiwe Msimango, Limbikani Mzava and Tapuwa Kapini, who are out. Mzava, who suffered an injury on the same day with Makhaula’s, according to coach da Gama is close to return to the team.
