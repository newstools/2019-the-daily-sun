Tales of horror were heard, and judgment was delivered. But to this
day, nine Life Esidimeni patients are still missing. Whether
they are alive or dead, it remains unknown at this stage. This has
been revealed by the DA Gauteng shadow Health MEC, Jack Bloom. He said the
Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku was replying to his questions in the Gauteng
Legislature on Tuesday. These are
the patients that were transferred from Life Esidimeni facilities in 2016 to
ill-equipped NGOS. This
resulted into the death of 144 patients, mostly due to starvation, lack of
medication and dehydration. Retired
Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke ruled that each affected family be
compensated with R1million. Bloom said:
“Masuku said that files of the patients had been requested from Life Esidimeni,
but there were no files for 5 of the 9 missing patients. “Two of the
missing patients have ID numbers, but none are registered to receive social
grant. Masuku said that no photographs were available of the remaining patients
and some leads were still being followed to find them,” he said. In March at
least 16 patients were recorded missing. “I am
pleased that progress has been made in finding more of the patients. I hope
that the fate of the 9 missing patients can be discovered,” added Bloom
