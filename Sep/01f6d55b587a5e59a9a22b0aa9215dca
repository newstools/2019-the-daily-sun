SIPHO Mashibini’s dad vanished when he was just two years old and his life became tough. Now he needs his father to perform rituals for him. Sipho (46) from Kagisanong in Mangaung is partially deaf. He said he wanted to work and not depend on grant money. He said he started encountering hearing problems when he was 16. “My mum took me to doctors. They said there was nothing they could do. I felt lonely and knew something was missing in my life.” His mum Popoki (61) said she was 15 when she met Sipho’s father. She said his name was Senwelo “Nkeru” Lejara. “I was young and didn’t pay much attention to his history and where he came from. I think he might have taken advantage of me and I fell pregnant,” she said. “He was a construction worker.” Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane from Botshabelo agreed the dad was needed to help Sipho, but said there was another option. “They should all gather as the mother’s family, slaughter an animal and ask their ancestors to welcome Sipho and help him.”
