One member of the so-called "Rolex Gang" was shot
and injured and three others arrested after a dramatic shootout with police on
Wednesday afternoon. The shootout, which happened at the Allandale Road offramp
in Midrand, was captured on camera. Captain Kay Makhubele told News24 that the gang had earlier
stolen a Rolex watch in Kramerville, Sandton. Police spotted a vehicle that matched the descriptions of
the gang's, after they robbed a woman in Rivonia at about 15:00. "Police tried to stop the vehicle, but the suspects
sped off and started shooting at the police," Makhubele said. "Police returned fire, while calling for backup." Members of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department and
Flying Squad cornered the suspects at the Allandale Road offramp, where one
suspect was shot and three others arrested, Makhubele said. The injured suspect
was taken to hospital. An unlicensed firearm was also recovered. The suspects were
driving a silver Volkswagen Polo, which was impounded for further
investigation. Makhubele said police would determine whether the vehicle
had been used in other crimes. The suspects are expected to appear in the Randburg
Magistrate's Court on Friday. SOURCE: NEWS24
