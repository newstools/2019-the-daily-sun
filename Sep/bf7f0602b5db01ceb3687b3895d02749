SEPTEMBER marks the International Gynaecological Awareness Month. And 10 September was the day to raise awareness on the importance of sexual health. Dr Masangu Mulongo, a research medical officer at Clinical HIV Research Unit, said the primary underlying cause of cervical cancer is the Human Papilloma Virus, which is the most common sexually-transmitted infection. There are more than 100 types but type 16 and type 18 cause 70% of cervical cancers. Dr Masangu said the HPV vaccine provides almost 100% protection against HPV 16 and 18 and the Department of Health regards it as an investment in the future of Mzansi women. “Yet, while the HPV vaccination can go a long way in reducing cervical cancer, not everyone is vaccinated. “An HIV-positive woman is five times more at risk to develop cervical cancer because HIV suppresses her immune system and makes her vulnerable to the HPV virus.” It takes 10 to 15 years for cervical cancer to develop in healthy women. But in women with weakened immune systems due to untreated HIV infection it can take only two to five years to develop. Sibongile Ramotshela, cervical cancer project manager at Right to Care, said they have set up mobile clinics in three provinces. Cervical cancer screening mobile clinics in Gauteng are found at the Thembalethu Clinic, Helen Joseph Hospital, the ORT Clinic in Diepsloot, uThukela District in KZN and Dwarsloop Community Health Clinic in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga.
