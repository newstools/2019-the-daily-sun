The body of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe is lying in state at his private resident dubbed ‘BLUE ROOF’ in Harare. The country is divided over the legacy of a former liberation hero whose 37-year rule was marked by repression and economic ruin. Current Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa also came to console the Mugabe family. Mugabe’s family have been at odds over whether he should be buried in his homestead in Kutama, northwest of Harare, or at the National Heroes Acre in the capital. Mugabe’s nephew Leo Mugabe told AFP that his body will lie in state at Kutama on Sunday night, followed by a private burial - either Monday or Tuesday - not at the National Heroes Acre.
