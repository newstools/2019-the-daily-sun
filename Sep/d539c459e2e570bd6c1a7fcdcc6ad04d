ANGRY youth of Ikemeleng squatter camp, North West, want Premier Job Mokgoro to intervene. They’re demanding a new school in their area.  Roads leading into Ikemeleng near Kroondal were barricaded with burning tyres, logs and rubble yesterday.   They said Tirelong Secondary School was too far, unsafe and catered only to Kroondal. The school is next to a cemetery and pupils fear for their lives. Residents claimed to have killed more than 10 snakes near the school this year. A youth leader said they were called to a meeting with the Rustenburg Municipality, but it didn’t happen. They had asked to meet officials from the education department and local mines.

Municipal spokesman David Magae said they were not responsible for building schools. He said the community was requested to create a conflict resolution committee to address their issues. “The community did not comply with the request to have a conflict resolution committee and discuss issues that the municipality can control. “The municipality was ready to engage the community, but they did not want to use the committee option,” he said.
