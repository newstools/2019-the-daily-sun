THE Western Cape government is committing R1 billion to fight crime and will train 3 000 law enforcement officers. “Working with City of Cape Town, we’ll fund and train these law enforcement officers,” said Western Cape Premier Alan Winde on Thursday. “They’ll operate province-wide, under the command and control of the Western Cape government.” The premier said he didn’t want to point fingers, but that cops had failed communities. “This province refuses to sit back and allow our residents to continue living in fear,” said Winde. He tasked each MEC with a safety priority duty in their areas. Cape Town mayor Dan Plato said these measures were a direct response to the cries of the people. “We can’t continue doing nothing. This is a radical intervention that came at the right time,” said Plato. Winde said they had to stop some projects to raise the money needed to fight crime. He said there was no quick fix and people shouldn’t expect an overnight solution. “It may take time but the plan can work,” said Winde. “This is my plan, but I will not shy away from amending or changing what doesn’t work or trying new ideas.” He said they were going to be led by their analysis on which area to send more law enforcement officers to.
