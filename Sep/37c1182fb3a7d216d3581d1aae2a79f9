THE Ben 10 is still calling Bongiwe’s family to ask for forgiveness. This after he allegedly burnt a pregnant Bongiwe Sothondoswe (38) to death in her shack in Eden Park last Saturday.  Her aunt Titi (48) still trembles with shock whenever she looks at the charred remains of the mkhukhu in which her niece died a painful death. She told Daily Sun she had told Bongiwe her boyfriend was no good, but she wouldn’t listen. “She would sometimes leave early when she visited me to avoid hot claps from her 28-year-old boyfriend, who’s now on the run. “I told her I didn’t want to end up fetching her in a coffin. We all tried but she just wouldn’t listen. The man still calls me to ask for forgiveness,” said Titi. Neighbours told Daily Sun Bongiwe had been abused since the beginning of the year. Busisiwe Buso (36) said she had warned Bongiwe about the man several times. “I told her to leave him. I know women who used to date him and they were all left broken and bruised,” said Busisiwe. She said Bongiwe was allegedly moered by her boyfriend on the day she died. Eden Park acting police spokesman Sergeant Sivenkosi Mtwa confirmed a murder case was opened and was under investigation. No arrest has been made.
