AMAZULU look set to appoint former Polokwane City coach Jozef Vukusic. SunSport has reliably learnt that the Slovakia-born is set to be unveiled as the new Usuthu coach before the end of this week. He will replace Cavin Johnson, who was sacked on Monday following a string of poor results. The Durban-based side have yet to win a match since the start of season, having lost three and drawn two from five league matches. If Vukusic gets his work permit on time, he will be on the bench when AmaZulu host Kaizer Chiefs at King Zwelithini Stadium, in Umlazi next Tuesday. Said the Source: “Vukusic has arrived in the country and is expected to finalise the deal with AmaZulu management before the end of the week.” AmaZulu team manager Qedi Dlamini didn’t want to divulge their interest on Vukusic, saying the club will announce the new mentor “soon”. “The club will announce the coach soon. “Soon can be today (Tuesday) or tomorrow (Wednesday) , but soon. We are in talks with a few coaches. When we are ready, we’ll announce the coach,” said Dlamini. Vukusic made his mark in the PSL with Rise and Shine, after he helped the club finish last season in fifth position. But he surprisingly parted ways with them at the end of the season. If appointed, AmaZulu will be the thirdclubVukusic has worked for in Mzansi, having previously coached FC Cape Town in 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons. The 55-year-old will need to hit the ground running to move the club from the bottom of the league table. Usuthu have not won in their last eight matches now, dating back to last season. Meanwhile, Chippa United have appointed Duran Francis as caretaker coach to replace Clinton Larsen, who was sacked on Monday due to poor results.
