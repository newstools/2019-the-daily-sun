MILLIONAIRE Sam “Mshengu” Chabalala was freed yesterday, but only for now. He was granted R200 000 bail by the Emalahleni Magistrates Court yesterday. Appearing in court, Chabalala looked happy and relaxed. He was backed by his workers, who celebrated with him after he was granted bail. Magistrate Mdumiseni Mavuso said the state’s claims that Chabalala was dangerous could not be proven. He granted him bail because of the strong ties he had in the country and didn’t consider him a flight risk. “There’s no evidence he has family outside the borders of the republic, and it’s unknown if he has business and family ties outside South Africa,” said Mavuso. Chabalala’s case was postponed to 22 November for further investigations. He was arrested by the Hawks at Highveld Mall in Emalahleni last Friday after a long investigation into his citizenship. The owner of Sam Holdings faces charges of fraud, corruption, contravention of the Immigration Act and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. But it seems more drama is following Chabalala, who attracted people’s attention’s in July after he flashed his 72 expensive cars in a convoy heading to the Durban July, Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Dineo Sekgotodi said they were following up on information that may link him to the murder of one of his employees, Nkosinathi Ngcongo. Ngcongo (30), a manager at one of Chabalala’s truck depots, was allegedly shot eight times at one of Chabalala’s businesses in Bethal on Thursday. His murder came just days after he gave the Hawks a sworn affidavit relating to an investigation about Chabalala. A source told Daily Sun one suspect was arrested (26), while another one was on the run. The suspect appeared in the Bethal Magistrates Court on Friday, and his case was postponed to Thursday.
