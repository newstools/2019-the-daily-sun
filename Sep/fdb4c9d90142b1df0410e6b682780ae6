SuperSport United coach Kaitano Tembo has explained how he has managed to get the best out of striker Thamsanqa Gabuza since his move to Matsatsantsa. Gabuza joined SuperSport from Orlando Pirates in the off-season and has made an impressive start to his career in Pretoria, scoring four goals in five starts. The 32-year-old failed to reach the same heights while at the Buccaneers where he came in for plenty of unfair criticism from the fans, which was the main reason for the marksman leaving the Soweto giants. Gabuza has been a different beast under the tutelage of Tembo and the Matsatsantsa mentor said that the target man is the type of character that needs to have an arm put around him if he is to reach his undoubted potential. “Gabuza is one player I have always admired, especially when he was still at Golden Arrows,” Tembo said. “His work ethic is unbelievable. He is a very good outlet. Even when he was playing at Orlando Pirates, he was always a problem. I always used to worry when I see him come on because I knew that your defence isn’t going to rest when he is around. That’s what he gives us. "He fits in very well in our structure because he has a good work ethic and at the same time he needs to be appreciated. "Given a little bit of love, that’s what we are trying to give him so that he can really express himself. He will make mistakes, we understand that, but we need to give him a little bit of encouragement and love.” SuperSport next assignment is against Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership clash at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadiumon Saturday 3pm. -Sport24
