 WHEN she dumped him, he threatened to kill her. Now the 15-year-old is living in fear after her 25-year-old ex-boyfriend tried to kill her twice. The two share a nine-month-old son, but the man denies being the biological father. The teenager from Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, had to be sent to live with relatives. Her 50-year-old mum told Daily Sun the family was scared, especially after they all were threatened with death.  “On Wednesday, he attacked my daughter at home with a broken beer bottle before robbing her of her cellphone. “He threatened to come back and kill her and their baby and put their bodies under a bridge. “He comes looking for her even at night. He took her to his place and wouldn’t allow her to go to school until he fathered her child. In June, he burnt all her clothes for leaving him.” The teenager said: “After I said I didn’t want him anymore in June, he first attacked me last Tuesday when I came from the clinic. He said he wanted us to poke and hit me with a beer bottle when I refused.” She said she was admitted to the clinic, and when she was discharged the next day he attacked her at home. “He might come to finish my baby and I off. I’m always looking over my shoulder.” Realising cops were hunting him, the man fled to Kumani Village, but on Thursday a group of women caught and moered him. He was rescued by cops. Captain S’fiso Nyakane said police rescued the suspect. “He’s in hospital under police guard after being wanted for assault.”
