THE economy is under strain and it is worse in a competitive space like retail. Martin Neethling, head of Sanlam Health Insurance and Distribution said there’s an emphasis on employee wellness right now that focuses on a 360º health approach, from a psychological, emotional and physical perspective. The World Health Organisation officially has recognised burnout as an ‘occupational phenomenon’. Martin said stress, burnout, depression and anxiety cause 40% of workplace illnesses. “Sanlam Primary Healthcare works closely with Dimanage. They shared insights from their disease and incapacity management system, which suggests most employees take 1,8 sick days a month, with gastro, flu and ‘non-disclosed’ reasons being the common causes.” The system’s data shows psychological conditions (burnout included) form the largest number of long-term incapacity cases. “Stress is among the top four conditions that leads to absenteeism. If payroll costs are about 2,8% for all absenteeism on average, stress accounts for about a third of this cost. These are direct costs. “Indirect costs can be three to seven times the direct costs.” Retail has a reputation for being stressful. High customer contact jobs (like call centres) are known to have higher absenteeism rates. The indirect costs of absenteeism include lost productivity, increased payroll costs from having to plug gaps with temps, overtime pay, admin costs and impaired customer service, which can put off returning clients. Low staff morale due to an increased workload is another issue. More access to primary healthcare – including counselling and therapy – can play a significant role in reducing absenteeism. “Flu also accounts for a large proportion of sick days. Stress accounts for a third of retail absenteeism payroll costs. So, consider improving psychological wellness through early interventions.”
