CHIEF Jerry Nkosi High School from Mpumalanga have been crowned 2019 COPA Coca-Cola Under-15 Champions. They stunned favourites School of Excellence 3-2 on penalties in the final played at Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium on Saturday. After three days of entertaining football, the curtain finally came down on the tournament which saw 65 goals scored. Gauteng representatives, School of Excellence, were widely considered the favourites to clinch the title this year after they ended Clapham High School’s dominance in the Provincial Finals. However, they came unstuck in the final against a determined Chief Jerry Nkosi High School who were making their maiden appearance at the National Finals. The two sides with contrasting styles – with the School of Excellence playing a neat short passing game while Chief Jerry Nkosi utilised their height advantage by playing long balls – dished out an entertaining final. For their efforts, Chief Jerry Nkosi walked away R80 000 richer while the School of Excellence received R60 000 for coming second. Speaking after the final, an elated Charles Makwakwa, who is the coach of Chief Jerry Nkosi, said he did his homework on the School of Excellence. “We knew that they play good football and their passing game is second to none, but we had to counter that with our strength which was our height and physique,” said Makwakwa. “We watched all of their game and we identified all of their danger players. We ensured that they could not get enough time and space to do what they are good at, which is to pick a pass.” Dr Reginald Cingo High School from Free State finished in third position after winning the 3rd-place playoff match against against Northern Academy from Limpopo 1-0.
