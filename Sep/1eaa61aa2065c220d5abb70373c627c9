GOGO Lucy Sokhelwa believes young people must pray and maintain a good lifestyle to have a long life. Lucy from Gugulethu in Cape Town was born in Elliot, Eastern Cape, in 1924. She’s 94 years old. She said she was a loyal member at Abalandeli baka Yesu Church and God gave her a long life and saved her from bad things. She never tasted alcohol in her life.  “They don’t go to church. I attribute my long life to the lifestyle I chose and God’s blessings,” she said. “I loved reading the Bible, but I’ve stopped because I can’t see properly.” She told Daily Sun she got married in 1948. Her husband died in 1970 and they had three kids. Her daughter died eight years ago.  “I believe if she had followed in my footsteps she’d still be around,” said gogo Lucy. She’s a member of the Cape Peninsula Organisation for the Aged in Gugulethu and has been in their choir for 10 years. “I sing alto. We’ll be having several performances in December at our centre, so we’re preparing,” she said.
