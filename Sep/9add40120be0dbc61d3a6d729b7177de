 An armed
robbery suspect was shot dead and four others arrested after a jewellery store
heist at the Mall of Africa in Midrand on Wednesday, Gauteng police said. According
to police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo, the armed suspects shot at the
police when they were intercepted in Marlboro, Johannesburg. The
officers returned fire, killing one. "The
police recovered a high calibre firearm and ammunition as well as Rolex,
Breitling, Omega and TAG Heuer watches when they made the arrests." The
suspects face charges of business robbery, attempted murder, possession of
suspected stolen property, reckless and negligent driving as well as being in
possession of an unlicenced firearm and ammunition. In an
unrelated incident in Emndeni, Soweto, four suspects were arrested after their
Toyota Avanza was stopped during Operation O Kae Molao, Masondo said. He said two
firearms were seized and the suspects faced charges of being in possession of
unlicensed firearms. "As we
are intensifying our crime prevention operation, O Kae Molao, and criminals
will be unable hide because the space is getting smaller and smaller. We are
urging members of the community to isolate all criminals," said provincial
commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela. SOURCE:
