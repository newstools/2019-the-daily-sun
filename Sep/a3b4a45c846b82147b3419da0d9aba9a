AN OLD bin and a construction object in the middle of a road in Rosettenville, Joburg, are making motorists furious. They’re meant to warn drivers to avoid a hole left open by thugs who stole the manhole steel cover. Motorists say they have to swerve dangerously when they approach the area. Molatelo Letswalo (34) said she almost crashed into another car. “The bin and the object are in the middle of two lanes. You can sometimes drive into the oncoming traffic trying to avoid them,” she said. “Traffic cops are aware of it, but they aren’t doing anything. They even conduct roadblocks not far from the spot. We don’t know why they aren’t informing the relevant department to fix the problem.” Tebogo Morena said: “The hole is dangerous, but putting a bin and the construction object there is not the solution.” Metro cop spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said manhole covers and potholes were not their responsibility. City of Joburg spokesman Virgil James said he’ll inform the relevant department.
