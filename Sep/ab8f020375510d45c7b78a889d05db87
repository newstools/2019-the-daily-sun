SAFA honorary president Prof Lesole Gadinabokao has endorsed Molefi Ntseki’s Bafana Bafana regime, which he says, should place greater emphasis on player development. Gadinabokao was part of the Safa NEC which recently appointed Ntseki to the hot seat. But he emphasised the need for national team coaches to help unearth and develop talent in rural areas. Gadinabokao, who is an unofficial ambassador for local tournaments in his home province, North West, has been attending the Ditsobotla Local Football Association (DILFA) “End of the Season Football Festival” in Lichtenburg. “I welcome the appointment of Ntseki as the Bafana coach. We hope to see him attending local tournaments to see the talent in the province. It is time we put trust in our local coaches,” he said. In their effort to unearth the future Bafana stars from the talent-rich but under-resourced province, DILFA has once again partnered with AfriSam to produce future stars such as the late Phil Masinga. Through the backing of the cement company, DILFA hosted the football extravaganza at Blydeville Stadium over the weekend. In a fun-filled event, Dingake Primary (Verdwaal) won gold in the girls U15 finals, while Florentina from Coligny took honours in the boys section. Gadinabokao has hailed the initiative, and has urged the Local Football Associations (LFA) to work towards a common goal of producing a second professional football club in the province, after the now-defunct Platinum Stars. “Development should not only be focused on the kids, but also on administrators and the coaches. Once you capacitate the administrators and coaches, you are bound to have a winning team as the three complement each other,” he added. DILFA chairman Thebe Sekoto said it is important to revive sports at schools and start nurturing young talent, hence the inclusion of schools in the tournament.
