It’s always fun to spice up your sex life, try new things
and to be adventurous with your partner. A fun interesting way of trying something new is using sex
toys. The variety of sex toys is huge, there are many toys to meet
anyone’s needs and wants. Here are six sex toys that you can explore with your
partner: 1. Desire Luxury USB
Rechargeable Remote Control Vibrating Panties There's something incredibly sexy about being in public with
your partner as they control your pleasure while no one around has any idea.
Vibrating panties are a lot of fun.  2. Unisex Strap-On Harness Kit If you've ever been curious about strap-on sex, this harness
kit contains everything you need: an adjustable harness and a seven-inch dildo
that works well for both vaginal and anal sex.  3. Liberator Ramp and Wedge Combo Liberator's ramp and wedge combo are created to make your
favorite positions feel even better. Along with making penetration from behind
more comfortable for all partners, the wedge and ramp can also be used to kneel
on during oral sex, so no more hard floors or rug burn while giving a blowjob.  4. Magic Wand If one partner has a clit, the other can take the magic wand
into their hands and control the on and off button. This can lead to some
dominance and submission play. The handle also works wonders to add to
penetrative sex and help the partner with a clit get off.  5. Vibrating Cock Ring A cock ring is just as fun for sex toy beginners as it is
for seasoned pros. It has one ring that wraps around the base of the penis and
a second ring that nestles between the testicles and the pelvis, providing
gentle but pleasurable constriction for both dick and balls.  6. Realistic Double-Ended Dildo The realistic double-sided dildo is for two people with
vaginas to use at the same time.
