BASH is bowing out of Rhythm City after almost a decade on the e.tv soapie. Siphiwe Mtshali plays the character. His storyline comes to an end when he dies. Bash is an ordinary guy who had to grow up very quickly in horrible circumstances. While other kids were playing games, he was in the street hustling for his next meal. Siphiwe said he was grateful for the opportunity he got on Rhythm City.  “I always knew that when I left home for work, it would feel like being with family. I have many memories that I’m taking with me because the cast are a brotherhood. “My exit is bittersweet, but I knew it was coming. I’m happy that I’ve left and there’s no bad blood. It’s like a boy leaving home to become a man,” he said. Siphiwe said he’s excited about upcoming projects. He’s working on a reality show with his wife. It’s called Grooming The Boys, and it’s under his company Izithi Media and Entertainment.  “I’ll also be on a show called Ifa Lakho. It’s coming soon on Mzansi Magic.”
