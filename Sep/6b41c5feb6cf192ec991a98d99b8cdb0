REACHING Cup finals has become a habit for SuperSport United. The Tshwane giants are in another cup final after beating Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0 (3-1) in the MTN8 two-legged semi-final. They are now going to face Highlands Park in the top eight final which is scheduled for 5 October at Orlando Stadium in Soweto. This will be their 10th time playing in a final since 2012 and that is more than any other PSL club. It will be Matsatsantsa A Pitori’s third final in a row having won the 2017 edition beating Cape Town City and lost last seasons to the same opposition. Now it remains to be seen who will reign supreme between them and Highlands in this year's final. They are the first club to achieve that feat since the telecommunication took over the sponsorship in 2008. SunSport breaks down SuperSport cup finals in the past seven years. MTN8 finals: Been into three, won once (2017), lost twice (2012 and 2018). Telkom Knockout finals: Two finals, one win, one loss. SuperSport doesn’t have a good history in the TKO. They have won only one title in 2014 under Gordon Igesund. They defeated then defending champions Platinum Stars 3-2, ironically at Orlando Stadium. They lost in the 2016 edition to Cape Town 2-1 in Polokwane. Nedbank Cup finals: Four finals, three-win, one loss They won it in 2012, 2016 and 2017. They were losing finalists in 2013 to Chiefs 1-0 in Durban.
