She said although she and Zothile had a traditional wedding, they wanted to share the glitz and glam of their white wedding with fans. “It’s been seven years but my relationship with him is still in the honeymoon phase. He means everything to me and I know every marriage or relationship has its ups and downs but I know God is here.” Dineo’s advice for a successful relationship was not to post personal issues on social media. “You’re just entertaining people and bringing problems to your relationship. Communication is everything and if things don’t work out, just leave.” Dineo’s fans soon started congratulating her on Twitter. Lean Madula tweeted: “Bawo, I pray for a long life for this marriage. May you keep them and bless them abundantly.” Twitter user Lerato wrote: “I’ll even watch the repeat. I never thought I’d want to get married but she’s just giving me courage. May the Lord bless you.”
