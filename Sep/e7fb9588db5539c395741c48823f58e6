THE Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa in Orlando East, Soweto, was built more than 60 years ago. But as members were preparing to go to church on Sunday, they received sad news. Their church had burnt down. Speaking to Daily Sun, church elder Therrance Phari (57) said: “Just after 2am, residents and congregants who live near the church were woken up by a loud bang.” According to Therrance, it sounded as if someone was breaking down the doors. “The congregants informed other members,” he said. When they got there they were met by huge flames.  “The church office was burnt to the ground, while the pulpit, pews and cross were saved,” he said. Another church elder Segoati Segale (46) said they were heartbroken. “Ever since the church was built more than 60 years ago, we’ve never witnessed any attempted robbery, let alone any arson attempt. “We don’t know who may be involved in the torching of the church, but we suspect foul play,” he said. Segoati said they hoped to get justice. City of Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi confirmed the incident. “We responded to the incident on Sunday at 2.20am,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Thebe told the People’s Paper: “Police are investigating. No arrest has been made at this stage as the suspect or suspects are unknown.”
