FORMER SABC head Hlaudi Motsoeneng gripped Mzansi’s
attention today when he told the state capture commission  that he has lectured at universities including
Wits. He said he was an educated person who had lectured about leadership
also that his lectures were turned into part of the curriculum. This was part
of the controversial issue of his matric qualification and his time as SABC Chief Operations
Officer where he has been accused by previous witnesses of pushing political agendas. Wits Business School took to Twitter during the day to
clarify that they did once Hlaudi took address a panel and he never gave a
lecture at the university on that day or any other day. “Hlaudi Motsoeneng was invited to take part in a breakfast
panel discussion at WBS on 6 Dec 2013. A guest speaker does not make an
academic. At no stage has Mr Motsoeneng lectured at WBS, nor has any material
authored by him formed part of the curriculum of any of our programmes.”
