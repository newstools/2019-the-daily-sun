National Director of Public
Prosecutions, Advocate Shamila Batohi has denied reports that she received any
payment from President Cyril Ramaphosa. Batohi’s name appeared on a list of names
of judges being circulated on social media with claims that those judges were
allegedly paid various amounts by the #CR17 fund. According to the rumours on social
media, Batohi is alleged to have received R1.75 million from the fund on 14
March 2018. Responding to an interview on SABC’S Morning
Live, the prosecution boss said the allegation were “utter rubbish and a lie”. She said they are just tactics meant to
distract her from doing her job. "I think these are tactics to try to
distract you from doing your work and this is the start of it. “There is going
to be a lot more and I realise I have to fortify myself against these attacks,”
she said.
