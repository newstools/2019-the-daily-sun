MEET the new Land Rover Defender, a true icon re-imagined for the 21stcentury. The manufacturer says it is clever, capable and safe for your family â€“ and in a category of its own.  It looks tough and is tough, but also designed with purpose and engineered to excite. Iconic in name, shape and capability, Defender can be personalised to allow owners to make the most of their world.  Across seven decades of pioneering innovation, Land Rovers have earned a unique place in the hearts of explorers, humanitarian agencies and adventurous families across the world. Beside the peerless luxury and refinement of the Range Rover family and the highly capable and versatile Discovery SUVs, new Defender completes the Land Rover dynasty. Driven by a passion and respect for the original, then new Defender delivers transformational breadth of capability.  Advanced all-terrain technologies redefine adventure for the 21st Century, remaining true to the pioneering spirit that has been a Land Rover hallmark for 71 years.  Gerry McGovern, chief design officer for Land Rover, said they created the new Defender to ensure it is ready for anything, with a design that has been inspired by the past, not constrained by it. At South African launch expected in the first half of 2020, the 110 line-up will include a powerful 3.0-litre straight six-cylinder P400 featuring efficient Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicle technology with outputs of 294kW and 550Nm.     Alternatively, customers can choose a 2.0-litre D240 turbodiesel with 177kW and 430Nm. The introduction of increased engine options, along with the short wheelbase 90 derivative, will follow later in 2020.
