METROBUS workers yesterday vowed to continue striking until their demands were met. Commuters were left stranded in Joburg after bus drivers downed tools. Workers belonging to the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of SA are demanding that the bus service operator pay them salaries that are in line with their work experience.  Union spokesman Dion Makhura said the strike would continue until the union and Metrobus reached an deal. They planned to take their demands to mayor Herman Mashaba.

Makhura rubbished reports that protesting workers hijacked a bus at Ghandi Square yesterday morning. “It’s a lie and we’d like to apologise to commuters for the disruption of the bus service,” he said. A commuter said the strike was a major inconvenience. “It’s the middle of the month and I’d just filled up my bus tag but now need to use a taxi. Where will I get money at this time?” she said. Metrobus spokesman Goodwill Shivuri said not all workers were on strike. “Threats of intimidation have forced us to stop staff belonging to other unions from working,” said Shivuri.
