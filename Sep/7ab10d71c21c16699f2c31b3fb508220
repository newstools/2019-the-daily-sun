THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has finally broken its silence on the ongoing xenophobic attacks. South Africa Football Association (Safa) and PSL coaches last week came out strongly to condemn the violent attacks on foreign nationals. PSL coaches such as Mamelodi Sundowns’ Pitso Mosimane, Baroka FC’s Wedson Nyirenda, AmaZulu mentor Cavin Johnson and Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela condemned the attacks. And former Zambia president and 1988 African Footballer of the Year, Kalusha Bwalya, also came out to deplore the unsavoury attacks. Mzansi has been the centre of attention around the globe following the attacks on foreigners, mostly in Gauteng that started three weeks ago. There’s also gender-based violence condemnation in the country. The PSL is home to tens of players from different countries such as Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Malawi, Namibia, Cameroon, Zambia and Madagascar. For the first time there’s a player from the Solomon Islands, an indication of how much the domestic league has grown in recent years. But the PSL does not feel there is any need to postpone the weekend Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship matches, following the two-week Fifa international break. The league feels it will not have any negative impact on the resumption of league matches, especially now that the rough streets seem to be calm after the storm. “We are a league held in high esteem by everyone at the moment,” PSL spokesman Luxolo September. “The PSL is watched by 21 different countries and has different nationalities. We should make this clear that the context of xenophobia is very important.” Citizens from other African countries have threatened to attack any South African product, and the attacks may vary with every country and this might even spiral to players in the locals leagues.
