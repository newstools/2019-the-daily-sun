TEARS rolled down the faces of hundreds of mourners at the funeral of the four kids allegedly killed by their dad. CHILD WAS SENT TO SHOP WHILE DAD KILLED SIBLINGS The funeral of Ayakha Jiyane (17), Sphesihle Mpungose (10), Khwezi Mpungose (6) and Kuhlekonke Mpungose (4) was held at Copesville, Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands. Their dad, Sbusiso Mpungose (44), appeared in the Pinetown Magistrates Court on Friday. He abandoned his bail application and the case was postponed to 9 October. Kuhlekonke, Khwezi and Sphesihle, his biological children, were found hanging in their home in Wyebank, Pinetown. Ayakha was found hanging in the bush near New Germany the same day. The kids’ aunt, Sne Mlawuzi, said: “The loss is too painful; it’s immeasurable. We don’t know how we’re going to get through this.” The kids’ mum, Xoli Mpungose, wrote them an emotional letter in which she said she was sorry for the pain they felt as they were being killed. Read out by her eldest sister, Mthobisi Mlambo, the letter read in part: “My angels, I’m sorry I couldn’t save you. Mommy misses you already. I love you so much. Please forgive me.” 'KILLER' DAD IS NOT APPLYING FOR BAIL! Ayakha’s friend, Aphethuxolo Qwane (17), said a huge hole had been opened in her heart. “Ayakha didn’t deserve to die so painfully. She was a bubbly girl who had a warm heart,” said Aphethuxolo. She said on the day of the incident Ayakha intimated she wasn’t feeling safe. “In fact, she had been telling us for a while that she didn’t like living in her home anymore,” said Aphethuxolo. Among high-profile people who attended the funeral were former president Jacob Zuma’s ex-wife Nompumelelo Zuma, ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini, KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala, Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza and Finance MEC Ravi Pillay.
