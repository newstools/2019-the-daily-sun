A SECOND group of Nigerians is expected to be flown home today. Yesterday, scores of people gathered outside the country’s consulate general in Joburg to get their names on the list for the flights leaving OR Tambo Airport for Lagos. The pain of losing their shops and belongings showed on their faces. But many said they’d rather die in their home country than here. Mike Onyemachar told Daily Sun: “There’s nothing like the fatherland, and that’s why we’re being asked to go home through evacuation and not deportation.  Echoing EFF leader Julius Malema, he asked why only black Africans were being targeted. “The whites are not being humiliated, and no one is calling on them to be part of these repatriations. “Why? The weapons are only laid on black brothers and sisters.”  Solomon Ola, whose shop was looted, said he’d get help back home. Asked about claims that Nigerians sold drugs, he said: “I’ve never seen drugs in my life. How will I know if someone is selling drugs?” Meanwhile in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, Malawians were also waiting to be sent home as the last group waiting for transport after Mozambicans and Zimbabweans had left.
