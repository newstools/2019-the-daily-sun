MICHO’s phone has been inundated with congratulatory messages, following his recent cup success with Egyptian club Zamalek. But the ex-Orlando Pirates coach would have felt a tad emotional reading the one from his former lieutenant Rhulani Mokwena. The two formed a strong bond during the Serb’s two-year stint at the Buccaneers, so much so that Mokwena was seen as an equal to the head coach and not a mere ball boy. “We were raised as people that understand that the cake is big enough for everybody, and we celebrate other people’s successes and achievement because there’s enough for everyone,” said Mokwena. “We do have any form of resentment or ill-feeling. When people do well, we are the first to congratulate them. Even when they go through hardship we will still support them. Once you are Pirates person, you’ll always be a Pirates person" “I sent him (Micho) my congratulatory message. He’s received it. We celebrate with him and we are proud of his achievement. And I think I speak for the entire institution. ”Together with Micho, Mokwena could not deliver trophies for the success-starved Bucs in the two years and now that responsibility rests squarely on his shoulders.
