STRUGGLING Black Leopards continue their march to register their first win at home this season when they host Bloemfontein Celtic at their Thohoyandou fortress on Sunday (3pm). Lidoda Duvha have lost two and drew one in their three home Absa Premiership matches, which sparked a huge frustration for their loyal fans. Leopards’ dismal home run have also cost their head coach Lionel Soccoia and his deputy Patrick Mabedi their jobs. Luc Eymael has been appointed on a two-year deal. “Our form at home has not been pleasing and we have to get it right on Sunday,” said Leopards’ veteran midfielder Robert Ngambi. “We know that Celtic are a good team but we cannot afford to lose or draw at home anymore. We are coming from a 2-2 draw away to Stellenbosch and the confidence is high. We just want to see our fans happy on Sunday.” Added the Malawian international, who scored one of the goal that helped the Venda based side earn a point against Steve Barker’s lads: “We are aware that they beat us last season here at home. But we are not looking at the past as it is not going to help us. Our focus is on Sunday, and to fight to see that we win at home for the first time.” Ngambi added that the team have been supportive to caretaker coaches.
