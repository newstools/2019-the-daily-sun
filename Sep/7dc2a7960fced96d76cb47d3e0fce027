THE search for Miss Mamelodi Sundowns 2020 is on! The crowned princess will walk away with a brand new Hyundai Sedan and R310 000 in cash. Two contestants shared R120 000 during the provincial Miss Mamelodi Sundowns pageant at Park Inn Hotel in Polokwane, Limpopo, on Saturday. There were 67 contestants who took part in the pageant. Ronnel Homu (20) and Lesego Matheba (20) were the lucky ones. They will represent the province in the national competition. Ronnel from Nkowankowa in Tzaneen said this was her second attempt at the competition, with the first one being in 2017. Ronnel, who is studying philosophy, politics and economics at Wits University, said she would invest part of her R60 000 winnings and use the other to prepare for the nationals. “I’m optimistic and believe I have a great chance of winning the title,” she said. Lesego (20) from Flora Park, Polokwane, said she entered the competition knowing the experience would empower her and contribute to her personal growth. The second year pharmacy student at the University of Limpopo said: “This will give me a platform to inspire a young girl child to say it’s possible to make it as a young black girl despite your circumstances.” One of the judges, Skeem Saam actor, Oratile Maitisa said the pageant was professional and well organised. Miss Sundowns project manager Angela Kubheka said the club would choose two contestants in each province until 23 November. The finals will be held in Gauteng early next year.
