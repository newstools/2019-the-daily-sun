MAMELODI Sundowns recorded the biggest win in history of the Caf Champions League when they thumped Seychelles’ side Cote d’Or 11-1 at Lucas Moripe Stadium yesterday. It means they advanced to the Caf premier club competition group stages by winning 16-1 on aggregate. They surpassed the previous record victory in the Caf Champions League that was marked just a year ago by Guinea Bissau club Benfica 10-1 at the preliminary round in 2018. This means the 2016 champions reached the Champions League group stages for seventh time in their history and fifth on the trot. As much as Sundowns thrashed Seychelles champions, in Africa or world football Cote d’Or are still known as the amateur side. The Tshwane giants, under coach Pitso Mosimane, an insatiable mentor, it will not come as sweet to the previous win against Al Ahly last year’s competition. Sundowns thumped 5-0 Ahly in the quarter final first leg also at Lucas Moripe Stadium, 6 March 2019. It was Sundowns’ biggest win in Champions League, and a biggest loss for Ahly in the CCL . It was also a first loss of such margin in their 77 of some years. With this ominous threat, the nine-time league champions will be one of the front runners for this year’s title and will hope a step further then last year when they lost 2-1 on aggregate to Wydad Casablanca in the semi final. The group stage draw will be made in Cairo on Monday. Some of the biggest wins in the history of CAF Champions League: 1.
