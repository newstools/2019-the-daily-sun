THE Nelson Mandela Bay kasi of KwaZakhele has been described as one of the most dangerous places in Mzansi. This was revealed by Police Minister Bheki Cele when he released the latest crime stats on Thursday.The kasi is number 20 in the Province for murders. And on Friday, angry residents of the kasi took the law into their own hands and necklaced two men. They said cops are incompetent and unable to fight crime. One of the residents told Daily Sun: “A group of community members mobilised after the two men allegedly terrorised them by committing house robberies and hijackings.

They drove with them to KwaZakhele, where they were beaten to death.” Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “Two unknown men were beaten and burnt with tyres in KwaZakhele by balaclava-clad people. “At the scene, no one was willing to talk to police about why the victims were killed, or to say who had killed them,” he said. “The community members just said they saw a group of people wearing balaclavas assaulting the men. “Murder cases have been opened and investigations are underway to establish the cause of the mob attack and those responsible will face the law.” Beetge urged residents to stop taking the law in their own hands. “If they have information about any crime they must call the police,” he told the People’s Paper.
