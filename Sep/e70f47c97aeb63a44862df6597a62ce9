Rapper, Reason has found himself in hot water after using producer, Heavy K as an example in a Twitter discussion. The Azania Rapper gave his pearls of wisdom to upcoming artists about creating a name for oneself in the music industry. Reason advised upcoming Artist to first make a name of themselves in their communities before aiming for the “bigger stage’. One of his followers disagreed, suggesting that social media has taken over and upcoming artists can use that platform, and when asked to name someone who has blown up from just posting music online the tweep sugegsted Heavy K. "Heavy K was relatively unknown and blew up from a hit he produced in his shack and then it was history from there", A Tweep responded.  Heavy K did not take Reason’s response well, and told him to not talk of experiences he know nothing of!
