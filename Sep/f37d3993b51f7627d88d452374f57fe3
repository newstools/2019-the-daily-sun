THERE’S sense of uneasiness from Kaizer Chiefs fans about their eagerness to see striker Lazarous Kambole find the back of the net. However, his coach Ernst Middendorp has made a plea and said the goals will come. Kambole, who joined Chiefs from Zambia side Zesco United during the off season, has yet to rattle the net for the log-leaders in six league appearances now. But what is so impressive about the Zambian is his work rate off the ball. He is  getting into good areas and sometimes when he has the chances to score, he rushed his decisions. During this past weekend's 1-0 win over Baroka FC at FNB Stadium, replacing striker partner Samir Nurkovic who is injured, Kambole’s influence was telling. The Zambia played a key role in the game's only goal which was scored by Lebogang Manyama. His overall impressive play, is the reason why Middendorp is not losing any sleep over the fact that Kambole is yet to score for Amakhosi. “Kambole is an outstanding player. He’s just an outstanding player,” insisted Middendorp, who was in good mood after the game against Baroka on Saturday. “One day he’ll start scoring and everybody will talk about it that he’s the most important player in terms of forward position in the country. “I’m so convinced about it. At the moment, he’s not doing the right things but we can wait for it.” Middendorp then added: “But as club we’ll make sure that fans see the really value of Kambole when it comes to his second season with the club. “Unfortunately, he didn’t have a break, he had a Cosafa Cup and cup competition with his former club.”
