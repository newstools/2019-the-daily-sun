IF Leciatainment was a person, turning 11 was going to be minor stuff! But because it’s a marketing and communications company, their birthday is a big thing. The company that has managed great entertainers the likes of Kelly Khumalo, Mapaseka Koetle, Fifi Cooper, Crazy Entertainers, Amo Chidi and Clement Maosa will throw the granddaddy of all parties. This year’s theme will be The Shorts and Shades. The company also promises revellers an event not to be forgotten. According to founder and CEO Tebogo Manganye, the concert will take place at Maungo a Matsapa in Brits, North West, on 28 September. The line-up includes Black Motion, Mlindo the Vocalist, Kabza Da Small,A-Reece, Chomee, Thabsie ,Clement Maosa, Thabo Leshole Mkhabela, Mashabela Galane, Sales man and Crazy Entertainers. Tebogo said this year’s celebration will be different from the normal celebrations because they want to give back to the community. Said Tebogo: “We won’t only be celebrating the year, but this time around we’ll be doing things differently. “Since July until now, we’ve been visiting schools with Botlhale from Idols and Crazy Entertainers. The aim was to educate and inspire pupils. We also taught them about the ins and outs of the entertainment industry.” He said there’ll also be workshops for up-and-coming artists a day before the concert, on 27 September. “Some of the artists billed for the show will also serve as facilitators. We want to teach artists about the business side of the industry.” This will be an opportunity for small entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. “Vendors and other business owners are free to come set up stalls at the venue to benefit from the event.
