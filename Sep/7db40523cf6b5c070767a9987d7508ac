SPRINGBOKS supporters have descended to Japan in large numbers to Japan as they seek to propel their side to victory against the All Blacks of New Zealand at the 2019 Rugby World Cup on Saturday. Many, including one Riaan Venter from Secunda in Mpumalanga, left Mzansi as early as Thursday to settle down and prepare for war with the opposing supporters here in the Land of the Rising Sun. The highly anticipated match between the two rugby powerhouses will kick-off at 11:45 SA time and the game will take place at the Yokohama International Stadium. And judging by the number of SA fans who were trickling into the capital city Tokyo, and at hotels and restaurants, the Springboks should at least occupy more than a third of the grandstand. Said Venter: "We love the Springboks and we are praying that they will end the All Blacks' domination. Our team is strong and the fans are united because we only want one thing - the World Cup trophy. We will support the team all the way to their last match in the tournament, and hopefully that will be in the final." Venter was with his fiancee Tammie and his three other buddies and they say they have been saving for this World Cup for the last 18 months. "We can never miss a World Cup. My fiancee was never a rugby person but now she loves the sport and want to watch every match. We are also happy with our squad and believe this is our best chance...Go Bokke," screamed Riaan.
