THE 18 Nedbank Team Ke Yona players are contemplating the future ahead of their drafts to the 16 Absa Premiership clubs on Friday. These are the players who made the Ke Yona Final where they lost 2-1 to Nedbank Cup champions TS Galaxy. As it has always been the norm, the players will be drafted to the teams where they will spend a month on trial hoping to secure a permanent deal. Yesterday SunSport caught up with some of the players ahead of their big day. Thabiso Lebitso who was the captain of the side, midfielder Thembelani Ndlovu and Aphiwe Maliwa, are anxious about the challenges ahead. “Being choosy is not an option in such situations,” said Lebitso. “We should not be worried where we go. Instead, we must appreciate and grab the opportunity with both hands and make use of it. “What I have learnt in football is that talent alone is not enough. These teams will asses a lot of things from our lifestyle, discipline and everything. I am hoping all of us who made the final team will use this opportunity wisely.” Ndlovu, who hails from Mooi River in KwaZulu-Natal, is hoping they will be given a fair share of chances in the teams to showcase their talents. “Wherever I will go I will be willing to learn and be a better player. The aim is to get contract, but learning is also key,” Ndlovu said.
