Most of us aren’t sure how to say sorry and find ourselves
tongue-tied when it comes to making amends, especially if we’ve hurt someone we
love. You can never go wrong with an apology from the heart and
when you’re at a loss for words, you can call on the experts for a little help. Twitter people decided to take their apologies to the
twitter streets. There are of course some funny apologies but, there are some
nice heart felt apologies. Do you remember when you used to ask MUM for money on pay
day and she’d say she’s broke, well, look at you now.
