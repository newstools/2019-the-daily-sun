Thembinkosi Lorch has broken silence about failing to secure a move overseas during the recent transfer window that has now closed. There had been plenty of speculation that the Bafana international will leave Orlando Pirates to join a club abroad after the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Teams and Belgium and France were interested in the forward and Lorch admits that negotiations took place right up until the last day that the window closed but agreement could be reached with Pirates. Lorch: "I had offers from clubs overseas, but I think the offers were not good for both the team and me. "I have a contract with Pirates and I have to focus and play as well as do my best." Lorch, who won the coveted Premier Soccer League (PSL) Player of the Season award last season, also said he has nothing to prove to anyone in terms of his performances for the Buccaneers. The forward said: "I have had some coaches telling me that I need to score more goals and things like that, but I feel I have done my part. "I don't have to prove (anything) to anyone. I just have to play my football and help the team to win games."
