The 24th of September marks the day we celebrate Heritage Day in Mzansi. But there is a few of us who know the reason behind this South African holiday. Initially, Heritage Day used to be known as Shaka Day in KwaZulu-Natal, according to South African History Online. The day was made into a holiday to commemorate the Zulu king, Shaka Zulu. In 1995, the Public Holidays Bill was presented to the new democratic Parliament of South Africa but it didn’t include Shaka Day. In response to this, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), a South African political party with a large Zulu membership, objected to the bill. How Heritage Day in South Africa came to be eventually, parliament and the African National Congress (ANC) managed to reach a compromise with the IFP. They agreed for the day to become a holiday where all South Africans observed and celebrated their diverse cultural heritage. Today, the Holiday is celebrated across the Rainbow nation, South Africans dress up in their traditional wear, cook traditional foods and unite, celebrating the diversity and the languages that Mzansi has to offer! An interesting fact about the holiday is that an initiative launched by Braai4Heritage aims to change the way South Africans “celebrate their common roots.” The organisation calls the holiday “Braai Day.” They promote South Africans braaing (having a barbecue) on Heritage Day. The initiative has been contested in the past but it also has some well-known supporters. Happy Heritage Dday Mzansi!
