There is definitely no doubt that at New York Fashion Week new trends are born and people follow them and they end up in our streets. Mexican designer Victor Barragán sent a diverse cast of models down the runway to showcase his Spring Summer 2020 collection. The inspiration behind it was hedonistic club kids, who look as though they got *seriously lit* the night before... we're talking slightly-smudged makeup and hickeys. The makeup artist behind these provocative looks is Marcelo Gutierrez. I WANT TO SEE YOU ALL WITH HICKEY’s ?? Makeup by me ?? LETS MAKE IT A TREND A post shared by  ?????????????? ??????????????????
