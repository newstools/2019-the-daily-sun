IT MAY still be early days, but indications are that four teams face a rough ride in the 2019-20 Absa Premiership gravy-train. Just five games into the new season, AmaZulu, Chippa United, Maritzburg United and PSL rookies Stellenbosch FC are yet to register maximum points. They are all still searching for their first victories of the campaign. The worst part is that AmaZulu and Chippa have already pulled the trigger on their coaches, Cavin Johnson and Clinton Larsen, who were fired on Monday respectively. Newbies Stellenbosch, who won automatic promotion at the end of last season from the National First Division (NFD), which is now known as GladAfrica Championship, have failed to repeat last season’s great display. History shows that, in most cases, newly promoted sides sink or swim and it appears Stellenbosch are battling to stay afloat. They lost 1-0 to Cape Town City, 2-1 against Bidvest Wits and 3-1 at the hands of Bloemfontein Celtic. They drew against Chippa and Maritzburg. However, it remains to be seen if the acquiring of experienced players such as Robyn Johannes, Mark van Heerden, Morgan Gould, and Ryan Moon will help the club. Gould, who was roped in to strengthen their defence, said they are not worried about the results. “The problem is that most people are worried about results, they don’t look at how the team play and draw positives from the performance,” he said. “Even our national team do not grow because we are too worried about results. You need to start somewhere to get to the top. We cannot all be Barcelona.” Stellies have only scored twice so far, with last season’s top scorer in the National First Division Iqraam Rayners struggling to find the back of net. The 36-year-old Gould added: “I cannot say the team are lacking experience. Every game has a different challenge, and the level of NFD and PSL is not the same.” On Saturday, Stellies will continue with their search for three points when they host Black Leopards at Athlone Stadium (3pm).
