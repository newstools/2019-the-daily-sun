THE looting
of foreign owned businesses has spread to some parts of Mpumalanga. Foreign
owned shops were looted and destroyed on Wednesday, Emalahleni Mpumalanga. It appears
the foreign shop owners are done with just sitting and watching the life
investments go to waste. In a video
shared by South African anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee shop owners can be
seen grabbing one of the looters and attacking him. The looters
can be seen making off with various items, including speakers, suitcases and
bicycles. As the alleged
shop owners were busy beating up the looter, a police officer had to intervene
and break up the fight. Mpumalanga
cops say over three people were arrested for looting.
