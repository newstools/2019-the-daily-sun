This is where you can recycle: Plastic only becomes rubbish if it is sent to landfills and dump sites, or chucked on to the streets. Many suburbs in metropolitan areas have scores of reclaimers who will remove your recyclable materials. If you donâ€™t have these guys removing your stuff, many churches, schools and shopping centres have recycle bins.
