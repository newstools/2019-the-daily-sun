BAROKA FC coach Wedson Nyirenda says he would have no problems walking away from the club should they decide his services are no longer required. The Zambian mentor was speaking after his side suffered their third defeat of the season, and second on the trot, when they went down to table topping Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. Asked whether he was beginning to worry about the possibility of losing his job following his team’s recent spate of disappointing results, he said:“I’ve never been worried about anything. “A job of a coach, is just like any other job, it’s just a title. What matters is my work. If they say I should go today, then I will say thank you and leave. That is part of football, you will find me somewhere else and I’ll be doing the same job. It is what it is, I’m not worried and I don’t’ feel any pressure. This is football.” In fact, Nyirenda insists that his team are title contenders, despite them being closer to the relegation battle than they are to the title race. They occupy 11th spot on the Absa Premiership standings with eight points from seven matches – eight more points adrift of leaders Chiefs. But Nyirenda believes it’s only a matter of time until his team underlines their “title credentials.” “We’re still very much alive to it (winning the league) we won’t be giving up. This is a marathon, you may start it very well but things could still happen during the course of the season,” said Nyirenda. “If we get our act together, with the way we are playing, we can score more than four goals per game. We are working on it, it just has to come right quickly before it is too late. “We have given away about 10 points now out of the required eighteen. So we need to fight in the remaining games and try to end the first round strongly.” Bakgaga next travel to KwaZulu Natal to face Maritzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Wednesday (7.30).
