RESIDENTS of Boitumelo in the Vaal had been living in the dark for two months, so they came up with a plan. They promised to pay the man known as Spider Man R3 000 to get the lights back on. But Spider Man was electrocuted on Tuesday by the transformer he was fixing. Residents said they heard a loud noise from the transformer moments after the man had arrived with his colleagues, who fled the scene after the incident. Nontobeko Zondi (33) told Daily Sun: “The man came in the morning with a small tool to fix the electricity. “He then left with his men and returned with the right equipment. “We heard a loud noise coming from a transformer as soon as he climbed on the ladder. “When we came to check what had happened, we saw him lying on the ground, dead, and his friends had fled.” Another resident said they had agreed to pay Spider Man R3 000 to fix the lights. But other residents didn’t want him to fix the electricity. Sibusiso Zondi (23) told the People’s Paper: “The man has been climbing on poles, fixing electricity for other kasis. “When residents told us we needed to pop out money to pay the man, we told them we don’t want anyone climbing on our poles except Eskom people.” Sibusiso said it was unfortunate that the man had died. Captain Teboho Lephoto confirmed the incident. He said police were investigating.
