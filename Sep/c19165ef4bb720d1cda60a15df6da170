FOR a while it looked as if his hideaway in the roof would work, but then he landed at the feet of shoppers when the ceiling collapsed! He had stolen a jersey worth R599 at a shop in the Thulamahashe Mall, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on Tuesday morning. In the video, the 25-year-old is caught and people can be heard laughing as he lies on the floor. A security guard says they caught the man earlier and he was in handcuffs when he asked to go to the toilet. A few minutes later the guards realised he had vanished. They then heard his footsteps in the ceiling. But a few seconds later the suspect suddenly fell from the ceiling and fainted on the floor. “His head was bleeding and his hand was badly injured,” said guard Shadrack Maile. “We called the police, put him in a wheelchair and took him to Thulamahashe Health Centre by car. “He was transferred by ambulance to Mapulaneng Hospital. The stolen jersey was returned to the shop.” Captain S’fiso Nyakane said a suspect (25) was in hospital under police guard.
