THE future of a grade 11 pupil who was bust last Friday for a break-in is still uncertain. The pupil and his co-accused were arrested after they were found with computers, laptops and a projector, which were stolen from Zwelibanzi High School on 13 September. They appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Wednesday and will be back in court on 29 October. They failed to pay the R5 000 bail and remained in custody. Principal Sibusiso Maseko welcomed the arrest, but was disappointed a pupil was part of the break-in.  He said he was worried about the break-in, as pupils needed the computers for an information technology exam next month. “I am relieved the computers were found as I was going around borrowing computers. “But I am very disappointed one of our pupils was part of the burglary,” he said. He said they would let the law take it course. “This will teach other pupils who are thinking of doing the same thing a lesson,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the provincial task team held an intelligence driven operation in Umlazi, which led to the arrest of two suspects aged 20 and 21. “The two were charged with burglary,” Gwala said.
