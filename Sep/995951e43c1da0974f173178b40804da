KAIZER Chiefs marketing boss Jessica Motaung has some time off her busy schedule to support the Springboks at the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Travelling with younger sister Kemoso Motaung, Jessica also passed a message of support for the Springboks' match against Namibia on Saturday. The Motaung sisters were interesting spectators when SA lost their opening match against the All Blacks of New Zealand over the weekend. "I am excited to here in Japan. As the 'Khosi Nation' we are fully behind the Springboks. I hope the team will remain focused and that they will stay disciplined  and work together for the coming match," said Motaung. "I'm obviously disappointed that we lost because I love South Africa. But we have to do everything possible to lift the trophy. We can still achieve our goal." Motaung added: "Things would have been easier if we won the first match but now we have a bit of a long road. But the more the battle is hard, the sweeter the victory. I am confident that the team will do well and go very far in the tournament. Good luck to them they are our pride."
