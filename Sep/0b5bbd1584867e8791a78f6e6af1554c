MARITZBURG United management have declared that they have “full confidence” in head coach Eric Tinkler, despite results not being forthcoming. The Team of Choice have struggled in the early stages of the current Absa Premiership campaign, picking up a mere two points from a possible 15. As a result, speculation has been rife that Tinkler, who managed to save the club from relegation last season, could face the axe. However, Team of Choice boss Farook Kadodia insists that Tinkler’s job is safe, adding that he has full confidence in the coach’s abilities. “It can be unsettling for the players and for the coach when rumours start circulating in the media, and we would therefore like to reiterate our trust in Eric Tinkler,” said Kadodia on the club’s social media platform. “We all know how he galvanised the team towards the end of last season. How he helped us win the play-offs to escape relegation - and we have complete faith that he is the right man for the job.” Tinkler, though, will be wise not to rest on his laurels as it would not be the first time club bosses declare their support for a coach only to show them the door soon after.
