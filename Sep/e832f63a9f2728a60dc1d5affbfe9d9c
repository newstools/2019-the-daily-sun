BMW
launched the seventh generation of the 3 series early this year and it didn’t
take long for tuners to start toying with it. But before we
get to discussing the tuned G20, which I’m head over heels in love with, let me
tell you a little story  My elder
brother hated the look of the new 3 series for a while, at some point he even toyed
with the idea of buying the Lexus IS 350 which looks aggressive from
all angles. At the
launch of the G20, there was lot of criticism that BMW designers had copied the
design from the Lexus IS.  Fast forward to the car being on the showroom, a lot of minds and perceptions were changed including
that of by brother who is now also in love with the G20. The German
tuner AC Schnitzer based in Aachen specialises in BMW, MINI, and BMW
motorcycles. Now they
have put their hands on the G20, you can give the mill a performance
upgrade, which will come with a 3-year warranty. AC Schnitzer
says performance upgrades for the 320i,
330i, the M340i and the 330d are under development.  The exterior can also be enhanced with the AC Schnitzer
sports rear silencer which has two exhaust tailpipes on each side for the 320i,
330i and M340i. The factory ride quality G20 is already exceptional, but you can upgrade to an AC Schnitzer sports suspension that has a lowering of
approximately 25 mm and overall is said to be much smoother.  I don’t about the rest of you guys, but my first experience with
the brand AC Schnitzer was with
their over the top mags.  As always, the AC Schnitzer wheels offer weight savings and
are offered in different configurations. You will have an option for the AC1 alloy wheels BiColor or
anthracite (all round: 8.5J x 19″ with a maximum tyre size of 225/40 R 19 at
the front and 255/35 R 19 at the rear). AC1 alloy wheels BiColor or anthracite are also available in
20 inches (all round: 8.5J x 20″ with 225/35 R 20 tires or 255/30 R 20 rear
axle).
