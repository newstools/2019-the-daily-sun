HE MAY not wield the kind of power Raul Gonzalez once had at Real Madrid. But Bradley Grobler’s seemingly carries enough weight to sway recruitment decisions at SuperSport United. Not that the striker has a big say in who comes and who leaves the club. But Grobler clearly played a significant role in the arrival of Thamsanqa Gabuza at United in the off season. “A couple of weeks before the season started, I got a call from our CEO Stan Matthews to speak to me about him(Gabuza). I didn’t even hesitate, I said to him straight away if you want the player you are looking for there is no better player than him,” said Grobler. “As SuperSport, we are very ambitious and I think the club have done extremely well in handpicking players who can make a difference, and one guy for me who has been an amazing addition to the club is Gabuza.” Grobler and Gabuza will be looking to combine to devastating effect when United tackle Mamelodi Sundowns in their MTN8 Cup return leg semifinal tie at Lucas Moripe Stadium (7.30pm).
