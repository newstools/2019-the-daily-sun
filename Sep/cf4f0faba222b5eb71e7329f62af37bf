A South African artist has been added to the Guinness World Record book, for the largest artwork made from coffee grounds. Percy Maimela, the artist from Pretoria says that while working as a merchandiser he accidentally spilled some salt on the floor and felt inspired to draw a beautiful portrait in it and after that his colleagues hyped him up so much that he quit to become a full-time artist. Percy now specialises in salt portraits, that are sprayed with glue before a light sneeze or breath of wind could make them disappear forever. To qualify for the title of the World’s Largest Coffee Grounds Mosaic (Image) an official spokesperson from the Guinness World Records stated that ‘The mosaic must be made entirely of coffee granules, fully grounded, and the image must be instantly recognisable’. First it was an Idea then we manifested. We are ready for this... We were born for it... Mom's knows I got this... Then boom, this size though. We are ready. They are not ready for us. #guinnessworldrecord #saltart #coffeeart #percymaimela #percymaimelaarts #investmentart #makinghistory #whattttt #art #aspiringartis #beyondimagination A post shared by  Percy Maimela Art (@percy_maimela) on Sep 13, 2019 at 9:25am PDT  A painful moment as @dean857 CEO of Brainfarm and I had to destroy a @guinnessworldrecords portrait of @realblackcoffee done with #coffee grounds at @sandtoncitymall.
