FORMER president Jacob Zuma has to cough up R7,3 million to pay back his VBS bond – or face losing his Nkandla property. Papers filed in the KZN High Court in Pietermaritzburg by VBS Mutual Bank’s liquidator, Anoosh Rooplal, show Zuma has defaulted on the loan granted to him in 2016. Rooplal and VBS are asking the court to grant an order forcing Zuma to pay up, or give an order to allow VBS to execute on the property. Zuma secured a much-publicised bond from VBS he used to pay R7,8 million to the Reserve Bank in September 2016 as part of what he owed for the upgrades to his homestead. The upgrades, initially sold as security upgrades, cost R250 million. They included a swimming pool, a cattle kraal and an amphitheatre. According to court papers, Zuma fell behind on the repayments for the first time in August last year, when he was R109 568 in arrears. VBS and Rooplal sent Zuma a letter of demand for the arrears at about the same time. Zuma then “effected sporadic repayments, all of which were less than the agreed monthly instalments”. According to the loan agreement, his monthly instalments are R69 000 over 20 years. As of last month, the arrears amount to more than R550 000. Zuma has until Friday to state whether or not he will defend the summons. – NEWS24
