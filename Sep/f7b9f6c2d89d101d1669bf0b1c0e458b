 A 28-year-old woman
will spend thirteen years jail after she chopped off her boyfriend’s 4-5 two years
ago. Brenda
Barattini cut off her boyfriend’s 4-5 during sex because he had allegedly shared
their sex tapes with friends. Brenda was
found guilty of the attempted murder of Sergio Fernandez, 42. According to
the Metro.co.uk, the accountant confessed that she had planned the attack on November
25, 2017, but said she had not intended to kill her former lover. Her trial in
Cordoba, Argentina, heard how Barattini cut through 90 per cent of musician
Sergio’s penis with garden scissors after blindfolding him and performing a sex
act on him. The
publications reported that she wanted revenge on her then-boyfriend because he
had been sharing X-rated pictures and videos of her, claiming he treated her
like a ‘trophy’. He told the
court: ‘After she put the blindfold on she told me I had to guess where she was
touching me. ‘She also
wanted to tie me up, but I didn’t let her. She began to practice oral sex on
me. ‘I suddenly
felt something. She wanted to kill me in that second.’
