IF you ask Dean Furman whether he thought he’d one day end up being one of the highest-capped players for Bafana Bafan, he would give you a definite NO! At fisrt, many football fans doubted Furman’s qualities, despite having come through the English Premier League side Chelsea’s development. Furman is anold-fashioned number six that has been modified in line with today’s trend. He brings balance to the team by breaking the play, known as the dirt work. He sometimes plays a major role in initiating attacks. When Bafana headed to the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) recently in Egypt, Furman was themost-capped player in the side with 50. He made his half-century against Libya in the last African Cup of Nations qualifiers group stages in March. After playing all five matches during the Afcon, in which Bafana crashed out in the quarter finals, he’s now sitting at 55. “To be honest wit with you, I didn’t imagine it,” said Furman. “The first call-up I didn’t even think I’ll play. “I thought I’ll go and train and see how it goes. The next thing I was starting. “The whole thing’s been quite amazing.” The 29-year-old was firstly called up against Australia in August 2012, but didn’t play. The following month, his dream came true to represent the country of his birth. He made his national team debut under Gordon Igesund against five times world champions Brazil. Since then, he has scored two goals. The Afcon 2019 finals was his third participation. He’s one of the two players who were retained after playing in the 2013 Afcon finals in South Africa along with Thulani Serero. Said Furman: “I’m very proud of the longevity that saw me get involved in the national team. “I’ll work extra-hard to keep pushing to make sure I’m part of the team going forward.”
