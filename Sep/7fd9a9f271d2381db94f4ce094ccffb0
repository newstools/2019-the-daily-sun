Arthur Mafokate's daughter Owami celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday - and she gifted herself with a set of wheels. Owami, who is also a DJ posted a picture of herself on social media standing alongside the new car, which is a Mini Cooper. It seems music runs in the family, as Owami's brother Arthur Junior is also a DJ, who is making a name for himself in the industry. Last year, he announced that he was having a child with his long time girlfriend. ???????????? - ?????? #??Wami A post shared by  Owami Mafokate (@owamimafokate) on Sep 20, 2019 at 10:16am PDT
