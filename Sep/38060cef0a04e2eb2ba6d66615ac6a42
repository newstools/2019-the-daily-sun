Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk is reported to have agreed a new bumper six-year deal with the European champions. The Dutchman has been a revelation since arriving at Anfield from Southampton and his presence in the heart of Jurgen Klopp’s defence has been key to helping them win the Champions League and battle with Manchester City for the Premier League title. The 28-year-old is now without doubt one of the best central defenders in world football and the Reds are keen to ensure he is secured to a long-term contract, one that command top-end wages. Liverpool did not appear to be in any rush as Van Dijk still had four years remaining on his current contract, but such have been the quality of his performances, Reds officials have tied him to fresh terms. It could only have been a matter of time before Real Madrid and Barcelona started to sniff around, and Liverpool are taking no chances. It is claimed that Van Dijk is now tied down to a six-year deal and will earn a huge £200,000 a week, which takes him just above the £190,000 a week that Manchester United recently handed to new signing Harry Maguire. Talks are said to have been ongoing since the summer but the deal was finally agreed and signed last week, leaving Van Dijk to focus on the rest of the season as Liverpool chase more honours. The Dutchman has already won the Champions League and Super Cup since arriving in the summer of 2018, but the Premier League title is the one that Van Dijk and everyone connected to the club really wants. City are looking strong again and it will no doubt be another two-horse race, but Liverpool have started the season well and with Van Dijk marshalling the troops at the back, will be confident of taking it right to the wire once again. https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/EnglishPremiership/van-dijk-signs-bumper-new-liverpool-deal-20190908
