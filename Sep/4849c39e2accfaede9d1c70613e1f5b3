The
Johannesburg Stock Exchange CEO, Nicky Newton-King has promised to engage with
business leaders. She told
the gender-based violence protesters that she fully understands problems faced
by women. On Friday,
Newton-King accepted a memorandum of demands from the representatives of the
Sandton Shutdown Movement. The
emotional march was organised by several civil society organisations aimed at
getting corporate companies involved in the fight against women and children. The
organisers said government has failed and they demanded at least 2% of profit
from companiesÂ to be funded towards gender-based violence. At first
the crowd heckled at Newton-King as they demanded immediate financial
commitment. Several
roads leading up to the Stock Exchange remained closed with high police
presence. Hundreds of
women and very fewer men chanted with placards demanding action. Newton-King
said: "There are suggestions in the memorandum that can be actioned
relatively quickly. I understand problems of women completely." She said:
"We will have a meeting with business leaders as well as the movement
leaders. Feedback is
expected in seven days. Meanwhile
the ANC Women's League, Bathabile Dlamini said life sentences should be handed
down to perpetrators of gender-base violence. She said
perpetrators should have their names published so they are known in the
society.
