REAL Kings chairman Bongani Ngidi has shut his door to whoever is interested in buying his club. This follows rumours that Shauwn Mpisane was on the verge of buying the club. Mpisane has been trying to get back into football since she quit Royal Eagles over differences with his estranged husband, Sbu Mpisane. The two, widely known as the Durban power couple, are understood to be getting a divorce. But eyebrows were raised when Shauwn formed part of the Real Kings team, which visited Jomo Cosmos for their GladAfrica Championship match at Dobsonville Stadium at the weekend. As Royal Eagles co-owner, Shauwn split the team and took half of the players, who included Edward Manqele, Levy Mashiane and Thato Tlhone, as well as coach Joel Masutha to Kings. This, it seems, was in anticipation of her takeover as Real Kings owner. These developments would explain her keen interest in the Kings’ affairs. Interestingly, Shauwn has offered the players to Kings in a one-sided “loan” deal, meaning she will be paying the players from her own pocket for the rest of the season. But Ngidi has denied he has put his club up for sale. “Shauwn has offered me her players, including the coach and I welcomed the offer,’’ Ngidi told SunSport yesterday. “This is because she was fearing that the players she retained from Royal Eagles last season will not play due to her separation from the club. She will be paying those players’ salaries. It’s a win-win situation for both of us. I’m not selling the club to her. You can call her a sponsor.” Shauwn tried in vain to retain ownership of Royal Eagles through the PSL, but her request was rejected by the League since the club is registered under Sbu’s name. There will be fireworks when Kings visit Royal Eagles, a match already seen as a battle of the “Mpisanes”, at Chartsworth Stadium on Saturday.
