MZANSI’S prominent road runner Thabang Mosiako is setting his sights on the FNB Joburg 10km City Run, taking place on National Heritage Day. The 24-year-old former SA 5 000m champion, who hails from the North West, finished in fourth place at last year’s race clocking 29:59. Filmon Ande of Eritrea won last year’s edition when he stopped the clock in 29:27. The Boxer Running Club athlete has had a tough 2019 as his programme has been disrupted by a spate of injuries. Mosiako says that he has been preparing hard for the race as he hopes for a slice of good luck in the upcoming competition. Well known road runners in Mzansi Elroy Gelant, Gladwin Mzazi, Joel Mmone and Lucky Mohale to mention a few, have indicated that they will also be taking part in the famous race. Mosiako was the highest South Africa finisher in the top 10 in 2018. But he is now looking forward to improving his performance of last season. He won a local 10km competition in Botswana in April running 29:44. But he knows that competition will be fierce at a competition that attracts international runners such as Lebenya Nkoka and Namakoe Nkasi of Lesotho. Mosiako said: “I’ve battled injury for the better part of the year. But I feel that I’m in the best possible condition to run this race. For the first time in weeks I’m gearing up for a race. I want to show people what I’m made off. It’s a tough event to win, but I believe in my ability to run a good race. It’s also an opportunity for me to erase the bad memories of 2019 and achieve better results.” Mosiako is aiming for a top three finish. But for him to achieve his race he knows that he must come up with a strategy to beat a highly competitive field on race day. “It’s important to maintain a good pace I mustn’t just go and run without a proper plan. The route is hilly and that can be challenging. For now, I’m working on my endurance as I eye a great return on the road.”
