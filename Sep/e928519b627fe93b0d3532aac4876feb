The Ndlovu Youth Choir are back on home soil, after a
fantastic run America's Got Talent. The choir unfortunately fell short of the big-win, and
California's Kodi Lee was crowned the season 14 winner. Speaking to Joanne Joseph on radio 702, choir director Ralf
Schmitt revealed on Thursday that the group had been offered a deal with Simon
Cowell. Ndlovu Youth Choir director Ralf Schmitt said they are
"overwhelmed" by the support from South Africans after reaching the
quarterfinals of America's Got Talent. Simon, who is one of the judges on the reality show, has
produced and promoted albums for various singers, as well as signed Westlife,
One Direction and CNCO. "We are very excited that Simon Cowell and his company
have exercised their option to sign the choir and together with Sony Music in
South Africa are working on exciting projects," he said. He added: "It is a wonderful compliment to these young
people because he wouldn't do that if he didn't think there is a future for
them and the work they have done." During the interview, the members spoke about the experience
on the show, their dreams for the future, and delivered a rendition of Higher
Love. It's unclear what exactly the details of the deal are, or if
they have accepted - but we look forward to seeing what the future holds for
the Ndlovu Youth Choir. WATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE:
