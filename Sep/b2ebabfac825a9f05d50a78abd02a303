POLICE Minister Bheki Cele said the killing and abuse of women should be viewed the same way, regardless of the victim’s social status. Cele said this while briefing the portfolio committee on police yesterday. “There was less noise when there was the shooting of six young girls between the ages of 18 and 25 in Philippi. I’m sure it’s because many of us didn’t know them.” Cele said the response from the government and activists was low. He said the government only got involved because one of the women died with her three-year-old child in her arms. But besides that, nobody cared about them. “I would like to get the statistics on how many women died after Uyinene Mrwetyana and how much noise we heard about them. “Let’s make women’s issues women’s issues, not because it is the daughter of Bheki Cele. I’m sure if anything happens to my daughter you will hear more noise, it shouldn’t be that way,” he said. To reduce crime against women, Cele said everyone should get involved. The minister said cops were not where they wanted to be but efforts were being made. Cele said his daughter, who is studying at University of Cape Town, told him she feared both public and private spaces.
