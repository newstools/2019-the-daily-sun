FOR most people, visiting their ancestors means going to a cemetery.But for this family it has become an uphill battle.REMAINS OF LOVED ONES ARE ON A HILL SURROUNDED BY WATER!For years, construction companies in Muldersdrift, Mogale City, have been digging on the plot where the graves are, but they’ve dug around the graves to avoid tampering with them, which has left them very high up. Boy Themba (38) from Video squatter camp near Cosmo City said 12 members of his family lie buried on the man-made hill. “We need help to move our ancestors from the hill so we can give them a decent burial. “One of the bodies fell from the top and human bones were strewn on the ground. My dead family members are not at peace. “I can no longer sleep at night. They visit and tell me to take them somewhere they can find peace.” Boy said his family worked for the previous land owner, and he had asked current owner John Wearne to exhume the remains. He had not received feedback. Boy’s grandfather Bushi Pitso (65) said his parents are buried on the hill, and his biggest fear was that he’d die before finding a proper place to rebury them. “It pains me that I can’t clean the graves or climb to the top to talk to my ancestors. I have to send messages with Boy.” John said he bought the land recently,was willing to help the family move the graves, but was waiting for authorisation from the Heritage Resources Agency. “The two previous owners are the ones who dug up the place and left the graves like that. “When I bought the plot, the graves were there. I already spoke to the family with a view to helping them.” The two previous owners of the land are not alive anymore. The agency promised to send officials to inspect the area. Mogale City spokesman Nkosana Zali said the family needed to apply for an exhumation order.
