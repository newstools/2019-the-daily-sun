THINK twice before you dump rubbish in any open space. This is the warning from Joburg Metro cops. They said they will be getting tough on illegal dumping. A motorist learnt this the hard way on Tuesday when he was fined R10 000. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the man was bust dumping rubble off his bakkie in an open field on the corner of Christiaan de Wet and Hendrik Potgieter roads in Roodepoort. “The 33-year-old’s van was also impounded for being unroadworthy. “He will have to pay the fine before his van can be released,” said Minnaar. Resident Maria Mkhize said: “If we don’t keep the streets clean, we’ll end up with kids eating poison, thinking it’s sweets.” Information pamphlets were handed out in various languages, including Somali, English and Zulu, to teach residents about the importance of waste management. “We’ll definitely keep the streets clean,” said another resident Mike Mulenga. The clean-up formed part of the A Re Sebetseng campaign introduced by mayor Herman Mashaba. It’s aimed at encouraging residents to clean the streets on the third Saturday of every month.
