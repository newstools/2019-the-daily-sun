PHOMOLONG residents are convinced they’ll soon need small boats to reach their front doors. A pipe that burst on Tuesday in the Ekurhuleni kasi has not been fixed. Derrick Mathala (35) didn’t go to work–there was water inside his shack when he woke up. “My bed was wet, all my clothes were wet, and my food was floating in water. “We had to scoop the water out. I was cold but had no choice. “A wardrobe fell apart when I opened it and food was spoiled. “I went outside and found a neighbour digging a trench, but water made its way into the shacks,” he said. He said the street was flooded. Sipho Mgaga (40) said it wasn’t the first time the pipe burst. “This is the third time,” Sipho told the People’s Paper. “The last time the councillor had to organise cement for residents to rebuild their shacks. “We’re lucky we woke up in time to dig trenches. “A water pipe once killed kids here. I don’t know if they want that to happen again. Our lives are in danger.” Councillor Doris Maja said she reported the problem to the municipality and officials had visited the area.
