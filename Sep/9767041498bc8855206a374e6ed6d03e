CAPE Town City received a huge morale boost ahead of their crucial Absa Premiership clash against Golden Arrows at King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday (3pm). The Citizens coach Benni McCarthy will have a full strength side for the first time this season with Taariq Fielies having fully recovered following a stomach surgery. The 27-year-old  is expected to partner Keanu Cupido in central defence, while Edmilson Dove return to his left-back position having played in the heart of defence in their last match. Last weekend, Thabo Nodada made his return to action when he scored a brace in their 3-3 draw against SuperSport United after being inactive since February due to a leg fracture injury. But Roland Putsche will miss the up coming game since he is recovering from a meniscus tear he sustained in a league match against Highlands Park in February. The Citizen captain Thamsanqa Mkhize is optimistic that the return of these key players will create a stiff competition at the club. He said: “The come-back of the core of our team from long term injuries came at a good time when we just started the season. We are happy that they are back because we have been struggling in their absence. “They were regulars when they got injured and we were affected. Now that they are back we hope things will go back to normal. ”The Citizens failed to defend their MTN8 title as they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Polokwane City. City have only gathered three points from one victory after five games. Mkhize feels they could have done better especially in their 3-3 draw against SuperSport at Mbombela Stadium. “We are disappointed in ourselves,” said Mkhize.“But what is positive is that we see where we are lacking. The opponents have been scoring from our mistakes.”
