PROPHET Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng wants to bring peace to Ekurhuleni. He was bothered by the division between Mandela squatter camp residents and those who were forcibly removed from the area last week. He visited the squatter camp yesterday and close to 700 evicted residents at DH Williams Community Centre, opposite his Incredible Happenings Ministries. He donated food and blankets. Mboro told Daily Sun: “What is happening here is sad. We should live in peace. I spoke to the leadership in the area and asked them to calm the attacks.” He said after some evicted residents went back to the squatter camp, Mandela residents wanted to attack those at the hall. “I had to intervene again and convince them to stop,” he said. Mboro prayed for those who said they wanted to go back to their homes but had nothing. “My shack was burnt with everything in it. What I’m wearing is all I have left,” said Emmanuel Ndlovu (36). Mandela squatter camp chairman Zamuxolo Khanyelo told the People’s Paper the evicted residents left the squatter camp and went to Nhlapo section. “The following day, a Mandela squatter camp resident was shot dead. Residents thought Nhlapo residents were protecting the evicted residents.” He said Mandela residents were angry and wanted to attack Nhlapo section, where DH Williams hall is. But Mboro intervened. A meeting will be held today between the residents, community leaders and those who were evicted.
