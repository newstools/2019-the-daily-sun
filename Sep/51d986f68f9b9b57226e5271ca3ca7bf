A PRISON warder facing charges of dealing in drugs, possession of dagga and contravention of the Correctional Services Act has been granted R2 000 bail in the Nelspruit Magistrates Court. Comfort Khoza’s case was postponed to 1 November. He was arrested on 31 August after allegedly trying to smuggle dagga into Nelspruit Prison. The 37-year-old was found in possession of four packets of dagga weighing 1kg and with a street value of R3 000. According to correctional services spokesman Messiah Hlungwani, officials sprung into action after receiving a tip-off about an official trying smuggle drugs into the prison. “The team followed the official from Nelspruit town, where he had collected the dagga, to the correctional services centre. “When he arrived at the main gate, the guards directed him to the search room. He tried to escape but was caught and taken to the search room, where he was found to be in possession of dagga,” said Hlungwani. He was arrested and detained at Nelspruit cop shop. Authorities are also investigating the matter internally. “The department takes rehabilitation of offenders very seriously and will deal with every object that impedes its mandate,” he said.
