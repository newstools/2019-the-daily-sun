FIKILE Gumede’s family is horrified after a close relative was arrested for her murder! The 67-year-old from KwaMashu G section, north of Durban, was stabbed and robbed of her cellphone and TV in June. Gogo’s son, Mvuselelo (35), said the relative was bust at a school and a second suspect in Mtubatuba. Said Mvuselelo: “The investigating officer told us the relative admitted to killing my mum. “She thought my mum ate all her dad’s money after he died in 2017. “On the day my mum was killed, the relative left in the morning and didn’t lock the gate and doors. She phoned a man she had organised to kill my mum. “The man came and demanded my mum’s personal identity numbers and stabbed her to death.” Mvuselelo said the killer then sent a message to the relative, telling her gogo was dead. “They withdrew the money and divided it among themselves. “We don’t know how much it was. I’m still in shock. My mum loved her killer.” Police spokesman Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that two suspects including the victim’s relative were arressted. “They will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court on Monday on murder and robbery charges,” Zwane said.
