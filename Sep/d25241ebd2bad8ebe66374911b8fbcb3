MOTORISTS have of late been giving traffic cops a hard time. Two incidents, in which motorists resisted arrest, have sent shock waves across Mzansi. On Tuesday, a video of a Gauteng traffic cop holding onto the bonnet of a moving car went viral on social media. The video shows a traffic cop clinging to the bonnet as the driver tries to get away. A taxi then blocks the road, forcing the vehicle to stop. Gauteng traffic police said the officer was in the process of issuing the 27-year-old driver with a fine. She was arrested for failing to comply with the instruction of an officer, reckless driving and resisting arrest. The incident took place in Robert Broom Drive, Krugersdorp. Traffic police spokesman Ofentse Morwane said the driver was arrogant. “It’s of utmost importance that our law enforcement agencies should stamp their authority on those who disregard the rules of the road,” he said. In another incident, a motorist was arrested on Allandale Road, near the Mall of Africa, last Friday for showing a Joburg Metro cop the middle finger when he was asked for his driver’s licence. The driver refused to stop for a roadside check and was chased down. He was arrested for crimen injuria, obstructing police in the execution of duty, and resisting arrest. Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “Anyone who disrespects the uniform and badge will be harshly dealt with and arrested.”
