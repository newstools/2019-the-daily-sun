 Two men hit during a
shootout with police were treated in a Durban hospital under police guard after
being caught cruising in a stolen vehicle. The pair face charges
of attempted murder, possession of an unlicenced firearm and ammunition after
exchanging gunfire with the authorities in Umlazi on Thursday. Police spokesperson
Colonel Thembeka Mbele said officers from the provincial task team had been
conducting an operation in P Section when they spotted a hijacked vehicle with
three occupants in Siqunga Road. “They instructed them
to stop but the occupants stopped the vehicle and fled on foot. The driver, 20,
was found inside the vehicle and was immediately arrested.” The man appeared in
the local magistrate’s court on Friday for possession of suspected stolen
property. The vehicle he was driving was hijacked in Merebank in June, police
found. “Police chased the
fleeing suspects who opened fire on them and a shootout ensued on Msingane
Road. Both suspects, aged 29 and 30, sustained gunshot wounds,” Mbele said. A revolver with three
rounds of ammunition was recovered from the suspects. Mbele said all three
would also be linked to the carjacking case opened at Wentworth police station. - Compiled by Tammy
