GREYTOWN magistrate court in KZN midlands was turned into fist fight arena when a rape accused, and victim’s family members exchanged blows. The shocking incident happened on Monday. A minute after the magistrate Jabulani Masuku announced that the case was postponed to 8 October for bail application, two family members allegedly started kicking and assaulted the rape victim's sister while coming out of the courtroom door. There was drama when the other victim's family members joined the fight to protect their sister. There was pushing and shoving and one cop who is a court orderly tried to separate the families. The victim's sister was left with bruises in the body and arm. She told Daily Sun that a brother and sister of the accused had asked why she was looking at the accused and started beating her. She said she has opened a case at the police station. The 31- year-old accused who is Umvoti mayor's cousin was supposed to apply for bail but his lawyer didn't come to court, so the case was postponed to 8 October. He was arrested last week for allegedly raping an ANC volunteer at the mayoral house. Outside court more than 1000 NFP supporters and about 100 ANC members picketed and said they came to oppose bail for the accused. The NFP councillor who also led the march to the municipal offices said apart from opposing bail they want the municipality to take the house back because the mayor has turned it into place where women are being raped. ANC Women’s league regional chairwoman Ntombi Ngubane said they came to support the victim.
