THE recent attacks on foreign nationals worry former African Union chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. She said the acts damaged the country’s reputation and it could end up losing foreign nationals who contributed positively to our institutions and health facilities. Dlamini-Zuma was speaking during her inauguration on Friday as the first woman chancellor of the University of Limpopo, taking over from Reuel Khoza. “We can’t fight any person coming out of this country because our hospitals, schools and financial institutions have many of our brothers and sisters who’re contributing positively,” she said. “These attacks are not in our best interests but badly affect African unity and integration as promoted in Africa’s continental free trade. “Those who’re here to commit crime must be treated as criminals like any other criminal.” Dlamini-Zuma said South Africans must realise that when student activist Onkgopotse Tiro was killed, he was working in Botswana but was not killed by the Batswana. “Tiro was living safely in Botswana but was killed by people from Pretoria,” she said. “People from other African countries never chased us away when we needed them most. They protected us during unrest.” SRC chairman Njabulo Mhlongo said installing Dlamini-Zuma as the first woman chancellor would change the varsity for the pan-Africanist. Mhlongo said Dlamini-Zuma understood health issues and would assist the university’s health faculty.
