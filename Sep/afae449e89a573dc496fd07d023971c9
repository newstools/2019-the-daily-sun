AFTER joining AmaZulu on a three year deal replacing Cavin Johnson who was fired on Monday, new AmaZulu head coach Jozef Vukusic is confident of turning around the situation at the club. The former Polokwane City mentor will be assisted by Mabhuti Khenyeza, who was a member of the previous technical team at Usuhu. "It is a good challenge to work in this league,” Vukusic told the club website. “The target is to play attractive football. I am happy with the squad and players. I know the statistics have not been good and the target is to turn that around." Usuthu have not won a game all season and are bottom of the log, and Vukusic will face a tough ask in the opening weeks, with matches against Kaizer Chiefs, SuperSport United and Cape Town City on the horizon. "I know the team from the outside but it’s important to learn about it from the inside," Vukusic added. "My work starts immediately. My hope is that every day, every session, the players improve and results will surely come." His first will be against Amakhosi on Tuesday at King Zwelithini Stadium at 7:30 pm.
