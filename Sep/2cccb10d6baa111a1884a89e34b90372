LAW
enforcement operations over the weekend in KZN yielded positive results. This comes
after the arrest of 24 drunk drivers that were arrested from Friday to Sunday. KZN
transport Head of Department (HOD), Sibusiso Gumbi said among the arrested were
three drivers arrested in Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, north of KZN. He said
they were part of the reed dance celebration that was held in this palace from
over the weekend. Gumbi commended
the police saying they did a sterling job. “The three
drivers that were arrested in Enyokeni on Sunday were arrested for driving
under the influence while they were transporting maidens from the celebration.
They were travelling to Mpumalanga province. They were detained in Nongoma cop
shop,” said Gumbi. He said his
department had promised last Monday during the state of readiness media
briefing at uMdloti RTI, north of Durban that they were going to keep a
watchful eye on the transport to and from the celebration. “We said
our focus was going to be on the roadworthiness of the buses and taxis
transporting maidens. We promised that we were going to go full force
inspecting if drivers were not overloading, speeding, drinking and driving,
fasten their seatbelts as well as to check if their cars were fit to be on the
road,” Gumbi said. He said
five cars that were stopped and removed from the roads had various faults while
it was discovered that three more cars were stolen vehicles and they were
recovered. “It is
quite relieving that that the province didn’t have major fatal crashes over the
weekend, and this is all thanks to the hard work of our police. It is also
pleasing to know that all those who broke the law were dealt with harshly and
will face the full might of the law,” said Gumbi.
