The South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO) has rubbished claims that they are planning nationwide shutdown. SANTACO says the nationwide strike which is alleged to be targeting foreign nationals is ‘fake news’. Santaco president Philip Taaibosch said the spreading of the fake media statements are attempts by cowards who want to keep the violence in the country ever rising. He said they are wrongly using the taxi industry name to make it happen to promote violence.  Last week, foreign owned shops were looted, and violent protests spread throughout Gauteng. On Sunday, a spate of violent protests resurfaced in the Joburg suburb of Malvern and one person was killed. Earlier in the day another person was stabbed to death with a sharp object at the corner of Bree and Plein Street.
