MISS South Africa Zozibini Tunzi is on her first ever overseas trip in the Big Apple also known as New York. Mzansi’s reigning queen posted on her Instagram a photo of her in the famous Times Square accompanied by a rather sad caption. “This is me in Time Square, New York. It is my first time out of South Africa and I should be overjoyed but I am ridiculously torn. My heart is back home with all the women in this difficult time."  "A month ago on the 9th of August I stood in front of the whole country and spoke from the heart about the plight of South African women and today it stands true more than ever. Something has got to change ??”  This is me in Time Square, New York. It is my first time out of South Africa and I should be overjoyed but I am ridiculously torn. My heart is back home with all the women in this difficult time. A month ago on the 9th of August I stood in front of the whole country and spoke from the heart about the plight of South African women and today it stands true more than ever. Something has got to change ?? A post shared by  Zozibini Tunzi (@zozitunzi) on Sep 3, 2019 at 12:01pm PDT  Zozi also reposted videos of the Q&A which won her the crown last month. Radio personality Anele Mdoda was one of the judges asked Zozi “what reason do South African women to keep smiling?” Zozi responded, “We have absolutely no reason to keep smiling because South African women are dying every day and nothing is being done about it”, to a huge applause and cheers at the Sun Square Arena in Tshwane.   On Monday she tweeted, “Someone asked me in an interview a few days ago if I thought we had a successful women's month this year? And I thought to myself- how? When we're dying for being women. As far as I'm concerned, women in my country are an endangered species. Stop killing us! #UyineneMrwetyana”
