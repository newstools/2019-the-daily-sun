A new study aims to explain what causes sex addiction. One of the study’s theory is that increased levels of the "cuddle
hormone" cause the addiction. People with who have excess oxytocin may be attracted to
many people at the same time. According to the study this may cause people to impulsively
seek sex. Signs you could be a sex addict: 1. Recurrent and intense sexual fantasies According to the Mayo clinic, recurrent and intense sexual
fantasies, urges and behaviours will take up a lot of a sex addict's time. 2. Compulsive masturbation There's no definitive answer for what is too much, but when
it starts to interfere with your daily life, alarm bells should ring. 3. Relationship troubles A lot of sex addicts have trouble establishing or
maintaining healthy relationships. They often attach themselves to people who are emotionally
unavailable and will sometimes avoid physical, sexual and emotional intimacy
for fear of being vulnerable. 4. Using sex to escape other problems Many sex addicts use sex to escape other problems, like
loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress. 5. Inability to stop or control the behaviours A sex addict's intense urges and fantasies may make them
feel like they're completely out of their control. Increased oxytocin It comes after researchers found that men and women with sex
addiction have an increased level of oxtyocin. According to THE SUN, experts, led by the Karolinska
Institute in Sweden, looked at the blood of 60 people, mainly men, who were
being treated for the disorder. And they compared them to samples from 33 healthy
volunteers. They reportedly discovered important differences in their
'microRNA' genetic material. The study's senior author, Professor Jussi Jokinen, told the
publication that: "To our knowledge, our study is the first to implicate
dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms of both DNA methylation and microRNA
activity and the involvement of oxytocin in the brain among patients seeking
treatment for hypersexuality.”
