The family of slain first-year UCT student Mhleli Cebo
Mbatha says he had warned his female relatives to be careful after attending
the funeral of fellow student Uyinene Mrwetyana, three weeks before he was
stabbed to death at Clifton Beach.  "He went to Uyinene's funeral in the Eastern Cape, not
knowing he would be next," his aunt Sbongile Nxumalo told News24 on
Monday, referring to the 19-year-old who was murdered at Clareinch post office
in Claremont a few weeks ago. She was also a UCT student.  "He was telling us how painful it [her death] was. The
last conversation he had with his sisters, he was telling them to be aware of
thugs, and that they must be very cautious."  Nxumalo spoke on behalf of the family, as Mbatha's
devastated mom Nomusa told News24 that she was not in a state to speak.  "He was a very good boy, a very humble person" Mbatha, who was studying law, was stabbed in the chest
during an apparent robbery at Clifton Third Beach in Cape Town on Saturday
night.  He would have turned 19 next month.  His friend was stabbed in the leg and taken to hospital,
while two female students who were with them escaped physical injury.  Nxumalo said they were told that people had wanted to take
their cellphones.  No arrests had yet been made, Western Cape police
spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andr√® Traut said on Monday.  "He was a very good boy, a very humble person," an
emotional Nxumalo said.  "You would always find him laughing and making jokes.
When you were around him, you would feel his warmth." She said they were disappointed and angry.  "It's not right. How can we live like this in our own
country? [To take] the life of a young child? It's bad."  While arresting someone would not bring Mbatha back, they
still hoped for justice.  A date for the funeral has not yet been set.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/clifton-stabbing-he-had-warned-his-sisters-to-be-safe-slain-uct-students-family-20190930
