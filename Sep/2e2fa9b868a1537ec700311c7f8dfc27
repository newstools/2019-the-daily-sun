Ntando Nono (MUTHALAND) THIS album deserves a standing ovation. Before its release, Ntando had somehow been seen as someone who was out of fashion. Now he’s right back in!  You can tell from listening to the album that the Afro pop star has gone out of his way to please. He starts the album with Ixesha, dedicated to his late friends. Ixesha advises people to cherish friendships. Although his style sounds different, he hasn’t lost his original sound. I applaud him for that. His sound is what makes him different. Listeners will dig songs such as Mbali, Ngomso and the popular Nono.– ANDISWA NGENYANE
