PUPILS attended the 25th anniversary of the defence force chaplain-general symposium in Tshwane on Tuesday. The event was attended by 21 military chaplain-generals from the US and Africa and 160 chaplains. Chaplains provide spiritual and moral support to soldiers and their families, as well as to communities living around military bases. Military psychologist Captain Mbusi Gumede made a presentation on suicide at this year’s event. “Chaplains were very enthusiastic about the topic as it’s close to their theological perspective,” said spokesman Colonel Malcolm Pillay. He said psychologists identify early warning signs that someone might want to commit suicide. Pupils from Eersterust High, Vhalliespark Primary and Hoerskool Voortrekkerhoogte schools attended the event. “We wanted to expose them to military culture as they might want to consider a career in the army,” he told Daily Sun. Pillay said the pupils enjoyed the occasion.
