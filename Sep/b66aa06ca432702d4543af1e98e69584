PHUMELELE Ndaba (45) has been struggling to run a creche from a mud hut since 2011. The woman from Manzana Village in Bergville, northern KZN, said she hoped a Good Samaritan would help her build a proper creche. She told Daily Sun yesterday that she started Sibongokuhle Creche because she saw local mums carrying kids on their backs while going to the bush to collect firewood or get water from the river. Others worked at a nearby farm and needed someone to watch their kids during the day. Phumelele said she hoped she’d get financial help from the municipality, but it never happened. She said the hut collapsed when there were strong winds in winter and local women had to rebuild it with mud blocks. Phumelele said her big worry was that the shack would collapse on the kids when it’s raining. “It’s difficult to live in the rural areas. We don’t get help like people in urban areas,” she said. “I hope a Good Samaritan will help me build a proper creche for the kids. Every time the weather is bad, we turn kids away.” Phumelele said she charged R60 a month for each child and had two teachers. Okhahlamba mayor Mlungisi Ndlangisa said he hadn’t received any requests for help from Phumelele, but he’d attend to her problem. He asked her to contact him directly. Social development spokesman Mhlaba Memela asked for Phumelel’s contact details and promised to help.
