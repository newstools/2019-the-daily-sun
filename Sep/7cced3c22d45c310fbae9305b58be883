CRIMES
associated with gangsterism have been prioritized by the Western Cape police. Western Cape
cops clamped down on the drug trade and the illegal possession of firearms over
the weekend and arrested 125 suspects. The police
seized dagga, tik and mandrax tablets were confiscated. “Twelve
people were arrested with unlicensed firearms, four for the possession of
ammunition without a license and sixteen for the possession of dangerous
weapons,” Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said in a statement. Traut said
their wanted suspect list has been reduced after 48 arrests were made and the
illegal liquor trade led to the arrest of 27 people. Meanwhile,
protest actions also resulted in the arrest of 16 people on charges of public
violence, and fines with a monetary value of R172 400 were issued by traffic
officials. “Our
endeavours to create a safer environment for the people of the Western Cape
will continue with the joint deployment of SAPS, SANDF and other law
enforcement agencies,” Traut added.
