A CROSSFIRE gunbattle between taxi association rivals has robbed two families of their loved ones. Rethabile Rapuleng (12), a Mogobeng Primary School pupil, was shot while on her way to meet her friend at Izibuko Primary School in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, on Wednesday.   A man who had gone to pick up his grandchildren was shot and died at the scene, while Rethabile died at the Bertha Gxowa Hospital. Rethabile’s mum Motshidisi Rapuleng (30) told Daily Sun: “I hope those men will be found and dealt with. Rethabile’s aunt Zanele Molefe (41) rushed the child to hospital after she was shot. “She was bleeding heavily. I tried to keep her alive by telling her not to stop breathing,” said Zanele. “The bullet hole in her head will haunt me forever.” READ: PICS: BABSIE IS HOME AFTER YEARS IN THAI JAIL Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the two families yesterday.
