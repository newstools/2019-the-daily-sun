FOUR suspects suspected of being on their way to commit a robbery were bust in Emdeni, Soweto, yesterday during Operation Okae Molao. Major-General Max Masha said police stopped a suspicious vehicle and found unlicensed firearms.  “The stop and search saved someone’s life and business, because these four men were clearly up to no good,” he said. “Their Toyota Avanza was seized. They will be charged with possession of unlicensed firearms while police continue to profile them.” The operation continued to a scrapyard in Midway, opposite Protea Gardens Mall, where parts from stolen cars were found. Masha said some of the parts came from a car reported stolen in Midrand, while others came from cars stolen in Westonaria. Captain Mavela Masondo said police received information about a business robbery at a jewellery shop on Tuesday evening. “The suspects were driving a BMW X5 in Ebony Park and were chased and started shooting at the police. A shoot-out followed, leaving one dead and the rest arrested.” A firearm and jewellery were recovered. Gauteng commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said: “Thugs won’t hide as the space is getting smaller and smaller. We urge people to isolate criminals.”
