But Moja Love spokeswoman Lindiwe Mbonambi told Daily Sun the show wasn’t cancelled but was on hold due to technical issues. “The footage had a problem and data on it was corrupted. The technicians are working on fixing the problem, and it will be aired as soon as everything is fixed,” she said. Daily Sun tried to contact Kgopotso, but his phone was off and cast member Vincent Nobela referred the SunTeam to the channel.
