A BUSINESS class flight from Joburg to Cape Town costs more than R8 500, while economy costs less than R2 000. So when Finance Minister Tito Mboweni flew to Cape Town from Joburg in economy class on Tuesday, he saved at least R6 000. An excited Mboweni posted a photo of himself in the plane and captioned it: “The rule in my office: If the flight is less than two hours, you fly economy class. Today, I was on SA 343 to Cape Town. Seat 14C. Ku rough! The National Breadwinner is serious about cost management.” In the picture, Mboweni is seen seated in economy class. While Mboweni felt what he did was great, many people did not feel the same way. Some users criticised him on Facebook.
