WOMEN visited the mum of the man accused of killing Uyinene Mrwetyana (19) but didn’t find her. EFF councillor Linda Mazwi, who was in Khayelitsha in Cape Town on Thursday, said they believed she didn’t raise a monster. “We were told by her neighbours she’s in hospital,” said Mazwi. “We know no parent wishes for her kid to be a monster. “Maybe she’s in shock. That’s why she’s in hospital. We don’t know.” They wanted to tell her they knew she didn’t send her son to hurt others. On Tuesday, Khayelitsha residents torched and destroyed the house belonging to the man accused of killing Uyinene. Feziwe Mahlubi (45), who lives in the same area as the accused’s mum, said the visit surprised them. “We didn’t know people would come here as no mother would send their child to hurt others,” she said. Feziwe said parents raised their kids to become respectful and successful. “It is hard to be a parent because you end up paying for your kids’ sins. “This is heartbreaking,” she said. Khanyisa Sawutana (48) said the women who visited the accused’s mum said they were just there to talk. “I feel for that woman and I think she needs all the support she can get. “I am sure this is also affecting her badly,” said Khanyisa.
