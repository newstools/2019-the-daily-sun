NEWLY appointed AmaZulu coach Jozef Vukusic faces a tough baptism of fire when they host wounded Kaizer Chiefs in an Absa Premiership showdown at the King Zwelithini Stadium tomorrow (3pm). But the Slovakian born coach said yesterday he knows what he’s getting himself into and he’s aware of the expectation to save one of the oldest clubs in South Africa. Said Vukusic: “I think I have enough experience to deal with that situation.” Vukusic was appointed as Usuthu coach last Monday replacing Cavin Johnson after the club failed to win any of their opening five league fixtures. The former Polokwane City coach, who took Rise and Shine to record fifth place on the log last season, signed a three-year deal. Usuthu are bottom of the table with two points. However, Vukusic took four points from Chiefs last season, something that will give him confidence. But, despite that, Vukusic says that will count for nothing in this game. “That is history. In this league no games are easy, and to collect points is tough,” admitted Vukusic. “You know AmaZulu last won in April and we are now in September. I hope we find a way to get a result before the October Fifa break.” Amakhosi come into this game having lost 1-0 against Vukusic’s former club Polokwane last weekend. Also, Usuthu’s history does not favour them. They have only beaten Chiefs once in their last 24 meetings. That happened in March 2007 in what was current coach Ernst Middendorp’s last game in charge in his first stint at Chiefs. Vukusic realises that the pressure is on him to turn AmaZulu’s fortunes around and a win over Chiefs would be a massive boost. “This pressure must be used in the right way to help us to perform and get a result.”
