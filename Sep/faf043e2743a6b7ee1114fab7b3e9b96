JABU Mtshweni (33) found a parrot wandering outside his shack in Nellmapius, Tshwane, two weeks ago and knew there and then someone was looking for it. “I’ve been feeding it peanuts and maize, and I bought a big cage for it,” he said. Jabu told the SunTeam the bird had a ring on its foot which he thought was what the owners had used to mark it, and it spoke Afrikaans. “When I ask it questions, it responds with a ‘nee’ or ‘ja’, so I’m assuming the owners speak Afrikaans,” he said. Jabu said word of the parrot showing up at his house has spread ekasi. “The community is very supportive and people are helping me search for the owner,” he said. “Many kids come here to look at it and it makes them very happy.” Jabu asked SunReaders to help him get the parrot back home. “I’ve seen people getting help from Daily Sun readers, and I hope to get help in returning this sweet bird home,” said Jabu. He said he wanted a reward, should they came forward. “I’m doing a good deed by keeping the bird, and I’d be happy to get money from the owners for helping,” Jabu told the People’s Paper. “But if I don’t find the owner or owners, I’ll just make it my own because we’ve already connected and bonded.”
