DESPITE being easily mistaken as being brothers, swashbuckling Matsatsantsa a Pitori midfielder Thabo Mnyamane and Moshe Ndiki have a lot in common. Mnyamane plays diski with a lot of swag and pinache - and as a result, he has left many defenders sprawled on the soccer pitch enroute to scoring his top-notch beautiful goals. Ndiki too is chic and goes about his business with acumen and class. His stature is growing and hosts a number of high profile shows both on radio and TV - he was also part of the high profile soapie, The Queen, where he won many hearts. Both are young and have so much going for them. Maybe one day they will sit down together and ponder as to how they could have such a strong resemblance and similarity.
