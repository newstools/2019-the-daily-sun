YESTERDAY marked a year since three firefighters died on duty. Mduduzi Ndlovu, Khathutshello Muedi and Simphiwe Moropana died while putting out the Bank of Lisbon Building fire in the Joburg CBD. In an event organised by the Gauteng provincial government, the firefighters’ families and colleagues gathered at the building in Pixley ka Isaka Seme Street to commemorate the day. Health MEC Bandile Masuku paid tribute to the men who gave their lives to help people. “I wish to once again honour the firefighters who lost their lives in this ordeal. These men went beyond their call of duty. In their last moments, they displayed a sense of high regard for service and others,” he said. Masuku hoped their level of service inspired others to serve with diligence and commitment.  “The responsibility is upon us to grow Gauteng Health together. May we, in remembrance of our fallen brothers, fight the good fight and ensure what happened is never repeated,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the families, Robert Moropana thanked the MEC for the commemoration. “I’d like to thank colleagues and government who were there in our time of mourning. Today I got to talk about these three fallen heroes,” he said. “When I hear fire engine sirens, I think of the three men. I know they would be on top of those trucks if they were still alive, ready to help communities.” Wreaths were laid where the firemen died and a plaque was unveiled.
