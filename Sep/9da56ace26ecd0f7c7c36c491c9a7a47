FLASHY Mpumalanga billionaire Sam Tshabalala was arrested by the Hawks on Friday. Mshengu, as Sam is affectionately known, made headlines when he splashed his expensive cars on social media. His convoy to the Durban July apparently had 72 cars, with at least more than 10 allegedly owned by him. The 23-year-old is reported to have accumulated his wealth through logistics and mining businesses in Emalahleni, Carolina and Middelburg. Even though Mshengu claimed he was born in Makwarela, Limpopo, some reports suggested he was born in Zimbabwe, hence his arrest by the Hawks for allegedly acquiring his South African citizenship fraudulently. In previous interviews, Mshengu said he had a difficult upbringing, especially after his father, who was a soldier, was shot dead in Democratic Republic of the Congo when he was only two days old.Reports revealed his family struggled to a point of lacking food, which resulted in him dropping out of school at the age of 11. Today he was supposed to have made his first appearance in the Emalahleni Magistrates Court, but the case could not be heard due to an electricity outage. The court heard it was not safe for the suspect to walk through the corridors in the dark and the matter was postponed to Friday. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the case against Sam Tshabalala of Sam Holding (23) was postponed to  this Friday She said Tshabalala is facing charges of fraud, corruption, possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition and Contravention of Immigration Act, 13 of 2002. Sekgotodi said Tshabalala’s arrest came after an investigation by the department of Home Affairs on how he acquired ID documentation. Sekgotodi also reaveled that Tshabalala tried to bribe the Hawks with an amount of R40 000 during his arrest.
