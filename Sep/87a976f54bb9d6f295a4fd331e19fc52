SCORES of maidens have started submitting their reed to the Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini. They are attending the annual reed dance celebration in his Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, north of KZN. The celebration aims at encouraging abstance in young girls until they get married. In numerous occasions the king has said the practice helps the nation address the issue of teenage pregnancy and help young people avoid getting sexual transmitted diseases like HIV. They collected reed in an open field about 5km away from the palace and they walk with it all the way to the palace where the king waits for them. He first took reed from her daughter, princess Cebolenkosi Zulu before watching thousands of maidens submitting reed before him. Over 30 000 maidens participated in the celebration. The weather is calm and maidens are wearing colourful traditional attires.
