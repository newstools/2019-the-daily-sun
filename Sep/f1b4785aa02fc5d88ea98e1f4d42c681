THE best of Polokwane City is yet to come! Expect an exciting brand of football from Rise and Shine tonight (7.30pm) when they tackle Highlands Park in the MTN8 Cup semi-final second leg at Tembisa’s Makhulong Stadium. Polokwane coach Zlatko Krmpotic is on a mission to turn the team into a force to be reckoned with this season. The soft-spoken Serbian seems to have settled quicker into his new role, having replaced countryman Josef Vukuzic at the start of the season. Krmpotic led Rise and Shine to a 1-0 win over Kaizer Chiefs in a PSL game at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. City captain Jabulani Maluleke scored the winning goal from the penalty spot to end Amakhosi’s unbeaten run. The win has moved Rise and Shine joint top of the log level with Amakhosi on 10 points from five games. Polokwane are now aiming for Highlands scalp after the teams drew goalless in the Wafa Wafa first leg at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. Krmpotic said he expects his team to play much better than they did against Chiefs. “We have some quality players in the team and I feel that the best of Polokwane City is yet to come,” emphasised Krmpotic. When asked what is it that he has changed since he took over the reins at the beginning of the season, he said he has been following the PSL for a long time while working in Zambia and Congo. City have conceded just one goal in seven matches in all competitions. “I followed the PSL from Zambia and Congo. I noted that many players in SA play as individuals, but I changed that mentality and made this team to play as a unit.” Rise and Shine are going into the cup match high on confidence, and the coach strongly believes that they will score in Tembisa. “We are not going there to play 1-1 or 2-2 draw, but we are going to try win the game. We are getting better with each game and I expect players to be fired up and reach their first cup final.”
