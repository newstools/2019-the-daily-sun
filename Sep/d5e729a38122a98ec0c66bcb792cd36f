SPHIWE Makwakwa said her life is a mess. The sad 49-year-old from Masoyi, outside White River in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun a tokoloshe had brought pain and suffering to her home. She claimed bad luck had been following her since 2015, putting her marriage under severe strain. Sphiwe said fights between her and her husband, Hendry Mokoena (52), had now spiralled out of control. “I need a break. I’ve been fighting with my husband for no apparent reason for far too long. I think all this happens because of the tokoloshe in my home,” she said. She said in the evening she’d hear footsteps on the roof. Their four-year-old son would wake up screaming and terrified. “My husband is a construction worker. When he comes back from work, we always fight for no reason. I blame the tokoloshe. “Sometimes I wake up and find myself wet and very tired as if I had been sleeping with a man. On 23 August I found a dead frog and snake left at my doorstep. “This tokoloshe also makes my neighbours hate me. I’m even contemplating committing suicide. “ I’m sick and have also lost weight. Doctors say there’s nothing wrong with me but when I consult healers, they tell me there’s a tokoloshe that has been sent by evil people who want to see me suffering because my husband and I are building a house,” said Sphiwe. Hendry confirmed he was also haunted by the creature. He said that it made him not to want to get intimate with his wife. “When I’m home from work, I feel there’s another man in our bed and sometimes I hear my wife screaming in her sleep,” he said. Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu advised the family to consult either a powerful healer or prophet to protect them before it is too late.
