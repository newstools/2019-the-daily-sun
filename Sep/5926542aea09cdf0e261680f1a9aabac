Check your ticket - you might just be nearly R22m richer as Tuesday's PowerBall results yielded one winner who hit the jackpot. If you chose the numbers 24, 10, 15, 28, 50 plus PowerBall number 05, your bank balance will soon increase by R21 939 453.20. Thirteen more take homeÂ R15 200 each for getting four numbers correct. National Lottery Operator Ithuba, announced earlier this week that it had paid more than R233m worth of winnings in just two weeks. "This is the largest combined jackpots payout in the history of the National Lottery and was paid out to multiple winners. The payout is another record breaker by the third National Lottery Operator [which] took over lottery operations in 2015," Ithuba said in a statement. The biggest winners came from PowerBall and PowerBall PLUS jackpots, with a R141m win on August 23 and R70m on September 3. The 50-year-old man who won the R141m payout played a ticket wager of just R105 via a Quick Pick selection method at a Spar in Groot Brakrivier, becoming the third richest PowerBall jackpot winner, News24 reported. While he hardly ever played the lottery, the man said something told him it was his lucky day and he should play, Ithuba said. His wife also had a dream a few weeks before in which she "saw gold particles being sprinkled all over her husband". A single mom drowning in debt won R70.8m in the PowerBall PLUS draw of September 5, Ithuba said on Tuesday. The winner was not named by the PowerBall operators, but she is a domestic worker who bought one R7.50 ticket at a Shell petrol station. Instead of letting the machine pick lucky numbers for her, she went "manual" and put in her own lucky numbers. She told Ithuba she had been drowning in debt as the sole breadwinner in her home. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/one-lucky-powerball-winner-takes-home-almost-r22m-20190911
