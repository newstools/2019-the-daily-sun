RAPE LIES catch up with Tinah. After all the love and support from the country following rape allegations against social activist, Tumi Sole, she has now revealed that it was all lies. Yesterday afternoon she decided to share her apology on twitter, admitting that she lied about being raped and that she even created a FAKE account to repeat and share the rape accusations against Tumi. These rape allegations were made on the 3rd of September, under the #tags, #AmINext, #HelpSurvivors and #RapistsAreTrash. The country was sympathetic and some even insulted Tumi and the NPO, Country Duty. In the statement, Tinah Mashiloane states that the allegations followed after several other messages she had sent Sole, making threats against him and his family. “I also created a fake account under Lerato Motsoeneng (@leratoMottsoene8) and repeated these false accusations,” said Tina. She also said she now realizes the pain she caused by her false and defamatory accusations. “I have decided to be honest and face the consequences of my actions,” she said.   “I was never at a Durban hotel or ever been raped. I realised that my actions might have derailed some of the necessary work that Mr Sole and the country,” she added. The "director of Country Duty" told Daily Sun that the founder of Country Duty was unavailable at the moment but said the organisations has acknowledged Tinah’s apology. Social media users are angry and were not shy to express their opinions regarding her apology.
