AFTER almost a decade after it set the bar for compact crossovers through its distinctive personality and emphasis on fun, Nissan has finally unveiled the next-generation Juke. The current Juke made its debut in 2010 with South African sales kicking off in 2011, meaning it’s really about time it was replaced! In its second generation guise, the Juke is back with its unique identity but with even more character, exciting performance and advanced technology. There is no word yet when it will go on sale locally but SunWheels expect it to be sometime next year.  The new design and exciting driving experience should appeal to the growing number of customers opting for compact crossovers. With larger dimensions, an athletic stance, striking 19-inch alloy wheels and a coupé style design, the Juke is quite a head-twister.  Equipped with full LED technology as standard, the latest Juke retains its iconic circular headlamps but with a new Y-shaped signature which complements the Nissan’s V-Motion grille. Dimensions are now 4,210 mm length, 1,595 mm height and a width of 1,800 mm for better roominess while remaining compact and lighter by 23kg. It is transformed on the inside as well with more room and boot capacity of 422 litres, providing 20% more storage room.  The new soft-touch materials on the dashboard, door trim and foot-wells offer a premium feel, while it is loaded with Nissan’s infotainment and driver assistance technology. Thanks to high strength steel, the new model features a more rigid platform that offers better stability, performance and cornering capabilities and new levels of confidence and control. The Juke is powered by an efficient 1,0 litre three-cylinder turbo-charged petrol engine with 86kW while there are two gearbox options, a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.
