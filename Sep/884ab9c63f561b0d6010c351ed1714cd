IT HAS been six years since the bus accident happened, yet they haven’t received the support they claim they were promised. The maidens were on their way from the reed dance in Nongoma to Mzumbe, near Port Shepstone in the KZN South Coast, when their skorokoro bus lost control in 2013. Seven maidens died and several others were injured. Philile Shinga (30) said the maidens had still not received any counselling, six years on. “What hurts me more is that we’ve never received any compensation from the Road Accident Fund,” Philile said. She claimed the Umzumbe Municipality promised to assist with funds and counselling.  “Most of us can’t work because of this. I can’t use my hands. I survive on piece jobs and can only do light work.” Umzumbe municipal spokesman Sabelo Ncwane said: “The municipality didn’t commit to assisting with funds but promised to assist by bringing them the relevant departments to assist them.” Sassa’s Mbizeni Mdlalose said the maidens should approach the agency for assessment. “But it’s no guaranteed they will be given a grant. It will depend on the outcome of the assessment.”  Road Accident Fund spokeswoman Thandeka Ngwenya said the matter would be investigated.
