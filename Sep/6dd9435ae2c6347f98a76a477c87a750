FORMER Black Leopards head coach Dylan Kerr, who is in mourning, is not thinking about possibility of returning to Lidoda Duvha now as his priority is to bury his mother. The Englishman resigned as Leopards coach in June after masterminding their Absa Premiership survival last season. The reason the 52-year-old parted ways with Leopards was to look after his mother who was ill and in hospital. And now sadly, she passed away last week. Speaking to SunSport from his home in England, Kerr says he has never had any contact with a PSL team. “I don’t want talk football now as my priority is to prepare to lay my mom to rest on Friday,” said Kerr. Asked if he would want to return to coach in the PSL, Kerr said: “I will talk about football after Friday.” On Tuesday, Leopards sacked their head coach Lionel Soccoia hardly three months after he replaced Kerr. The relatively unknown Soccoia was only in charge of five league games, winning one, losing three and drawing one. Soccoia was shown the door at the Venda based side together with his assistant Patrick Mabedi and team manager Mlungisi “Professor” Ngubane. Lidoda Duvha have appointed interim coach Morgan Shivambu and Samuel Banda in a bid to turn the corner. However, Leopards have been linked with former Polokwane City and Free State Stars coach Luc Eymael.
