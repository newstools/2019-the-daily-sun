A woman's toenail was 4cms long and at least 1.5cms thick when she arrived at the Florida clinic needing urgent help. The woman had not cut her nails for a year and the nail had an overgrow with an infection. Changes in your toenails may be a sign of an underlying condition like fungal growth know asÂ onychomycosis. If left untreated, thick toenails can become painful and a quicker treatment is key to curing the nail fungus. Fungal infections can be difficult to cure and may require months of treatment. This condition occurs when a fungus or yeast enters your toenail.  This woman's thick, yellow nails took around 20 minutes to hack back and one had grown to a staggering 4cms in length and had trapped the toe next to it. Dr Nguyen, who runs a clinic in Tampa, Florida, use a pair of heavy-duty cutters as to remove the toenails one by one.
