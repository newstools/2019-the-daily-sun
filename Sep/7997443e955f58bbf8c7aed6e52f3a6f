LOCAL jeansmaker Tshepo Mohlala has an A-list new client, one of the most famous women in the world who happens to be royalty.  Today, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, visited the studio of TshepoJeans in Joburg where she fetched her custom made pairs for herself and her baby son Archie.  Tshepo posted a photo of himself with his special client and said:  “About 4 weeks ago I got a call from the British embassy. The Duchess of Sussex placed an order for a pair of jeans and today she came to collect them personally... Surprised her with a pair of dungarees for Archie and the rest is history.”    Last December the SunTeam reported that TshepoJeans dressed Cassper Nyovest for probably the biggest performance of his career at the Global Citizens Festival in Joburg.  Cassper was also wearing TshepoJeans the day before at his Fill Up Moses Mabhida concert in Durban.      Meghan’s official visit of Joburg will start tomorrow and end with a meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria on Wednesday.
