RESIDENTS say they don’t care about the law. Two people accused of robbing residents were caught and killed on Saturday. This happened in an open space next to Phandulwazi High School in Luzuko, Philippi East, Cape Town.  Resident Mthobeli Mavundla (40) told Daily Sun: “We’ll never report these cases to the police because the only response you get from them is that they’re busy with investigations.” He said suspects started robbing people on Friday night and continued on Saturday. “They were stupid for thinking they could rob people in the same area for two days. They’re where they belong,” he said. Another resident, Siyolise Mlonyeni (37), said they were tired of being victims. “These kids rob us every day. We live in fear because of them and they know they won’t get arrested for what they’re doing,” she said. Siyolise said victims were robbed of cellphones, money and wigs. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said Philippi East police were investigating a double murder case. “Police responded to a complainant and found the bodies of two men with multiple injuries,” said Rwexana. The two men were allegedly assaulted by the community. She said suspects were yet to be arrested.
