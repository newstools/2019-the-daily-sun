FRISA needs help to bury her stepdad. Moses Tjhela (64) from Westbury, Joburg, died on 30 July. But Frisa Nage (32) is unemployed and needs help to bury him. “I don’t have money to bury him. I have no one else to assist me. My mother is mentally disturbed, which means I have to figure out a way,” she said. Moses’ body has been at the mortuary for more than a month. “It will be there until I raise enough funds to bury him. That’s why I’m pleading for help.” Frisa told Daily Sun she had also been unable to trace her stepdad’s relatives. “I’ve never seen my father’s family. I only heard they were in the Free State. I tried to get in contact with them. I even wrote emails to them but there are no responses so far,” she said. “If I don’t do it for my father, no one else will. What pains me is that if he stays in the mortuary for more than three months, the government will bury him. All I want is to bury my father in peace.” Anyone who can help is asked to contact Daily Sun on 011 877 6000.
