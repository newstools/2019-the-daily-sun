BUSISIWE “Cici” Twala feels the justice system has failed her after the man she accused of abuse was not found guilty. Cici was speaking at the Soweto Theatre in Jabulani, where she was part of the Stop The Violence Campaign discussions hosted by media personality Masechaba Lekalake. Cici said women did not report abuse as the justice system always failed women. “I spoke out about abuse, opened a case, went to court and gave enough evidence but my perpetrator was found not guilty,” she said. She was speaking about the abuse she allegedly endured at the hands of her then boyfriend, kwaito legend Arthur Mafokate. Youth activist Malaika wa Azania and actress Shoki Sebotsana sat on the panel. Cici stressed that women had done everything to try and deal with gender-based violence, and men must now do something. “Men need to have a dialogue with themselves on how we can change this,” she said.

He said many children were raised by their mothers, but young men from such families could opt for a mentor when there was no father figure in the household.
