BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has named his squad that will play against Mali in the annual Nelson Mandela challenge. The match is scheduled for 13 October at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth with the kick-off set for 3pm. It will be coach Ntseki's first match in-charge of the senior man's national team since he was appointed in August. Ntseki, who previously coached the national under-17 side, replaced Stuart Baxter who shockingly resigned after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament. Ntseki was due to take charge of his first official match during the September International Fifa break against Zambia before they pulled out of the friendly due to the xenophobic attacks that were happening in Gauteng. The South African Football Association (Safa) hastily arranged a replacement match with Cosafa compatriots Madagascar, but they too withdrew from the encounter two days before the match. After the Mali clash, Ntseki faces a big test when the 2021 AFCON qualifiers kick off. Bafana take on African giants Ghana on Monday, November 11 in an away fixture before returning to South Africa to entertain Sudan on Tuesday, November 19.Venues and kick-off times for those matches have not been confirmed.
