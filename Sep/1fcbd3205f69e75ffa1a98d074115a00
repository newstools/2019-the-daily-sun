SINCE winning the Nedbank Cup last season and earning the right to participate in this season’s Caf Confederation Cup, TS Galaxy have been on cloud nine. The Rockets, as Galaxy are affectionately known, took a giant step towards qualification for the group stages of the continental tournament. This after they defeated CNaPS Sport from Madagascar 1-0 in the first-leg of their first round Confed Cup encounter played at Mbombela Stadium yesterday. Their confidence and hunger skyrocketed higher last month when they brushed aside St Louis from the Seychelles 2-0 on aggregate in the preliminary round of the club continental competition. Sanele Barns’ solitary goal ensured that the Rockets take a comfortable lead into the reverse fixture in a fortnight. Galaxy will be expecting another feisty affair after the Malagasy outfit gave them a taste of what is to come in the return leg. The Mpumalanga team will be looking to seal their passage to the second round and ultimately the group stages of the tournament in what is their debut campaign. Unlike some other South African teams, Dan “Dance” Malesela’s side appear to be giving the continental tournament their all. Their determination to go as far as possible in the competition has been evident from the first match they played. They showed their intent once again against the seven-time Malagasy league champions, flying out of the blocks to take an early lead through Barns. The ill-tempered affair would not produce any more goals as Galaxy denied the visitors the crucial away goal. They now turn their attention back to the GladAfrica Championship as they prepare to host Ajax Cape Town at Kameelrivier Stadium on Sunday.
