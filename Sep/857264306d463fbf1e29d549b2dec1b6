Hey MizzB WHEN I was nine years old, my father’s half-brother sexually molested me. Now I’m 23 and still struggle with a lot of anger towards him. When I confronted him about what he did to me, he accused me of being a liar. He later apologised for molesting me. The problem is that I still feel a lot of anger and I’m trapped in the past. Hey Lady It’s unfortunate that the man who abused you denied and played down what he did. Your feelings of anger come from your unresolved past. If you don’t deal with these feelings, wounds of the past will bleed negativity into your life. They will rob you of a chance to be happy. Let us walk this journey of recovery with you.
