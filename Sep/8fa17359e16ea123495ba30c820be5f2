This traffic officer went the extra mile as he tried to stop a motorist from dodging a fine in Krugersdorp on Friday. In a 17-second video that went viral on social media on Tuesday,Â a Gauteng traffic police officer can be seen hanging on to the bonnet of a moving vehicle. To the officer's relief, law enforcement managed to block the vehicle and bring it to a stop.   According to a statement from the Gauteng Department of Community Safety, the officer was in the process of issuing the driver with a traffic fine for using a cellphone while driving. The belligerent driver chose to drive away with the officer desperately clinging to the car's bonnet "The conduct displayed by the driver is not only reckless but also smacks of arrogance," said department spokesperson Ofentse Morwane. The driver was arrested for failing to comply with the traffic officer, reckless driving and resisting arrest. She also received a fine for driving while using a cellphone. "The conduct of the driver in question is punishable at all costs and will never be allowed," Morwane said.  https://www.news24.com/Video/SouthAfrica/News/watch-traffic-cop-literally-goes-the-extra-mile-while-hanging-onto-moving-cars-bonnet-20190917
