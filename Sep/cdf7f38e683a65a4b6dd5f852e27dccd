TRAINEE Rinae Ramabulana (21) from Tshiozwi Village in Makhado, Limpopo, says working at a bar is the same as being an usher in church. “I sold sweets to kids at church, and now it’s food and beverages.” Rinae is a waiter at Kone Village Boutique Lodge in Ha-Ramantsha Village. “I started as a casual until owner Bonolo Sebata took me for training. She’s a caring mum who pushes me to succeed in the hospitality business,” he said. Being a waiter meant learning about people from all over the world. “There are people I never expected to see in my village. They come from all over Mzansi and from as far away as Jamaica,” he said. “This gives me the courage to serve and know humility regardless of the situation.” He checks in and registers guests, and finds out about late arrivals. “This helps me to prepare. It gives me direction for the day, whether serving breakfast, cleaning, setting lunch for parties or conferences.” He makes sure the atmosphere is welcoming. “A waiter must respect time and be presentable since guests like a good looking waiter. “Never come to work without a pen, corkscrew, lighter and a notebook and confirm your order before leaving the table. This makes life easier.”
