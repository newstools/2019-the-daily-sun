THE SABC’s forensic unit is dealing with 186 disciplinary cases. In a statement, the broadcaster said: “Some of the cases date back a number of years but were left unresolved or simply abandoned by the previous management. “The cases being pursued include fraud, mismanagement, sexual harassment, editorial interference, irregular salary increases and irregular appointments.” The statement said the broadcaster was committed to ensuring that due processes were followed. It said the disciplinary processes would be implemented, regardless of rank or tenure. It said some employees were going through disciplinary processes while other had been suspended and dismissed. It said those affected were linked to transactions amounting to R5,2 billion. “Some of the cases point to downright criminal activities,” read the statement. The cases were being pursued as a result of a number of investigations and reports, including from the public protector, parliament and the special investigating unit. The reports uncovered wrongdoing by public officials, leading to a crisis of governance. “It’s the responsibility of the leadership team to stabilise the SABC, strengthen governance and ensure that the integrity of the institution restored,” the report said.
