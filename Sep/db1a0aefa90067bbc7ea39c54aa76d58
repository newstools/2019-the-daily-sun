THE Nedbank Ke Yona Team coach, Khabo Zondo, is optimistic that some of his players will secure contracts with Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs at the end of the term of their placing. Although his charges suffered a 2-1 defeat to Nedbank Cup champions TS Galaxy in the Ke Yona Challenge on Sunday, the former Golden Arrows mentor sees a bright future for his youngsters. The 16 players will have a month-long trial with the top flight teams and will know next month after their placing where they will be heading in a bid to realise their dreams. Said Zondo: “I am confident that Blessing Chauke, Thulani Cele, Aphiwe Maliwa, Nhlanhla Malinga, Sello Mochoeneng and Christopher Maoto will do well during trials, even though the team conceded two goals. “Others will have to work extra hard, even a player like Bongani Sam (2017 graduate now with Orlando Pirates) was not better than others when we identified him. But that shows football is a funny game and can surprise you. Aubrey Modiba (2015 graduate) was not at his best against Orlando Pirates (Nedbank Cup Champions), look where (SuperSport United) he is now.” Although, Ke Yona Team have never beaten a PSL outfit since the talent search program started seven years ago, Zondo was satisfied with his charges’ performance. “I had a moment of happiness and disappointment during the match. Whatever I expected happened. My boys were a bit nervous, but they played with bravery and mental toughness. At the beginning it was an onslaught against a team that don’t give you possession of ball,” said Zondo. “But they got settled and I sorted a few things out in the second half. They changed the complexion of the game. “Tactically, they knew what to do and we scored a beautiful goal. It was a good game and people enjoyed football.”
