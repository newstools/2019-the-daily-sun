Women of Mzansi gathered at Parliament in Cape Town to fight women abuse on Thursday. This is after student Uyinene was murdered by a post office employee who has since been arrested. But on Friday morning, the community of Gugulethu found in NY112 woke up with the sad news after one of their daughters was killed. The young woman’s head was crushed with rocks near Lwazi Primary School. Founder of Ilitha Labantu Mandisa Monakali is calling for the community to take a stand against this scourge. Cops are investigating.
