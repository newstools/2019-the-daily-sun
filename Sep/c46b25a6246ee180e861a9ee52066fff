 MARITZBURG United have given Eric Tinkler the benefit of doubt, even though pressure is mounting on the KZN side. There has been speculation at the weekend that the Team of Choice coach could be on his way out, should he lose their next match against Chippa United at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday. Tinkler, though, will be wise not to rest on his laurels as it would not be the first time club bosses declared their support for a coach, only to show them the door soon after. In his declaration of “full confidence” support, like he did on Fadlu Davids, who is current assistant to Rhulani Mokwena at Orlando Pirates, Maritzburg chairman Farook Kadodia recalled how Tinkler helped his team. Kadodia insists that Tinkler’s job is safe, adding that he has full confidence in the coach’s abilities. “It can be unsettling for the players and for the coach when rumours start circulating in the media, and we would therefore like to reiterate our trust in Tinkler,” said Kadodia on the club’s social media platform. “We all know how he galvanised the team towards the end of last season. “How he helped us win the play-offs to escape relegation – and we have complete faith that he is the right man for the job.” The Team of Choice have struggled in the early stages of the current Absa Premiership campaign, picking up a mere two points from a possible 15.
