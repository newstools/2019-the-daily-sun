BAFANA Bafana could continue to feel the ripple effects of the widely-publicised xenophobic attacks. Already reeling after Zambia and Madagascar backed out of friendly internationals with the national team, Safa could be faced with another tricky situation next month. There are no guarantees the football association will secure Bafana a friendly for the October Fifa international week, as new coach, Molefi Ntseki, builds towards the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. In fact, Bafana may be forced to play teams outside the continent, a scenario which may not be ideal for their Afcon qualifier preparations. “We have two windows, the September and the October one,” said Safa acting CEO Russell Paul. “As much as we were utilising the September window for the coach to settle in, we have to move on to October and do back-to-back qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan in November. Yes, there are plans for October. “We are speaking to opponents to try and finalise for October. It is extremely difficult on the continent but hopefully we will be able to release the fixtures in a couple of days.” Safa have condemned the attacks and have been at pains to explain that the attacks issue was a political and not a football matter. But the challenge to invite teams remains for Bafana and Paul hasn’t ruled out the possibility of playing teams outside the continent, though he admitted that may not be ideal. “You are playing Ghana and Sudan and you’d want to play a team that play in that kind of formation,” added Paul. “If you play a European team they are not necessarily going to give you that expertise and benefit. “The challenge you will face with opposition not from Africa is that you will have to play those fixtures abroad purely because is South America and in the US, they are already playing the World Cup qualifiers. “But then again it’s a technical issue and the coach will have to decide.”
