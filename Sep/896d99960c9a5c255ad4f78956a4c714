CHIPPA United’s Clinton Larsen has become the first coach to bite the dust in the 2019-20 Absa Premiership campaign. Larsen, who joined the Chilli Boys in a spot of bother last season, managed to turn the situation around and save the club from relegation. However, following a disappointing start to the current campaign, Larsen has been given his marching orders. The Port Elizabeth- based side currently occupy 13th spot on the standings with three points from five matches. The Chilli Boys’ operations officer Lukhanyo Mzinzi, confirmed that the club had indeed released Larsen from his duties. “We are still discussing (Larsen’s departure) with his agent and we will release a statement in due course,” told SunSport. In the meantime, former Bay United defender Duran Francis is said to be poised to take over from Larsen on an interim basis while the club searches for a permanent replacement. Chippa's next match is against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (3pm)
