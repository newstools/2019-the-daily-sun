Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng says South Africans are not
xenophobic but that they are starved of economic gain.  Speaking at the University of KwaZulu-Natal's spring
graduation, Mogoeng said there was a link to economic strife and xenophobia.  "South Africans are not xenophobic. If I was
xenophobic, I would be attacking the vice chancellor (a foreign national)
now."  He said that the largest African against African xenophobic
attacks occurred in 2008.  "We must ask, why is it that the large-scale attack of
that nature is happening again in 2019. We tend to prefer naming and labelling
things. In 2008, we had an economic meltdown all over the world. People were
hungry and retrenched on a massive scale."  He added that jobs are scarce and that life is
"expensive".  "So, just like Archbishop [Emeritus Desmond] Tutu
warned the Pretoria Afrikaner chamber of business some 13 years ago, truly
desperate people resort to desperate measures."  Mogoeng said all criminality should be punished.  "Every crime must be punished and be punished
thoroughly because it projects SA in a very bad light and gives a perception
that the African continent of people are incapable of dealing with their
problems properly."  He questioned why South African intellectuals were not
attacking their foreign counterparts.  "They have jobs, food to eat and opportunities. There
may well be xenophobic elements but it is not where the problem ends. If you
think teaching people to love one another, that will be the end of it, you are
joking."  He appealed to researchers to focus on the "true
problems in Africa".  "Let's go deep into our problems. Why is a continent so
rich in minerals, water and fertile soil, yet we are counted among the beggars?
It is nonsensical."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/south-africans-are-not-xenophobic-they-are-hungry-chief-justice-mogoeng-mogoeng-20190912
