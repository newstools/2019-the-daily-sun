Renowned Mzansi radio host and DJ, Fresh has denied allegations made against him in the social media account and campaign #AMINEXT, in which alleged survivors of sexual assault and rape named their alleged attackers. Thato Sikwane, better known as DJ Fresh in statement published across his social media platforms dismissed the allegations, saying as a person, who has been in the entertainment industry for over two decades, he has considered himself as a tool and a voice for the unheard. "The current allegations are false and without basis. They have been made and published, recklessly," the statement reads, in part. He further refers to the ongoing fight against gender based violence, saying  that it saddens  him that the "shift is being shifted from the real issues and perpetrators". As for statements made against me by someone I had a relationship with 18 years ago, they are without merit and denied.
