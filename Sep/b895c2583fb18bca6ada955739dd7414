UNDER fire Orlando Pirates caretaker coach Rhulani Mokwena has decided to put out one fire by quitting social media. SowetanLive reports that the 34-year-old has deactivated his Twitter account” for the sake of his sanity and peace.” The former Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach who is now at the hot seat at Pirates was active on Twitter frequently sharing his sometimes controversial opinions. But ever since he took last month following the surprise resignation of Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic last month, supporters of the Buccaneers have not held back their disappointment at the team’s poor start to the season. The Bucs have been booted out of two competitions, the MTN 8 and the Caf Champions League under Mokwena and have struggled in the league where their arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs are currently at the top. Mokwena will hope for a change of fortunes when their league mission continues on Saturday when they face Chippa United. He continued to tell SowetanLive at the Rand Stadium today, “Look‚ I think it’s more spiritual than anything. “It was not about trying to evade the criticism and the noise. “Criticism will always be there even if we win games. "We will always be criticised and that’s the nature of the beast. “You’ve got to accept it when you work in an environment such as Orlando Pirates. “But like I say‚ it had nothing to do with me closing my account‚ it’s more religious and it’s for my own sanity and my own peace.”
