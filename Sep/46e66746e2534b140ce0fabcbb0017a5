THE community suspected the man raped a 17-year-old girl living with a disability and it cost him his life. Women from Tshakhuma outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo were collecting firewood on Monday when the man allegedly grabbed the girl. While the women ran away, the man took her into the bush. Instead of calling cops, residents searched for the man themselves. When they found the man (39) roaming the streets, he was brutally assaulted, pelted with stones and burnt to death. Resident Jonas Netshituni (52) said people were angry following the escalating incidents of gender-based violence. “That’s why they decided to attack the man and kill him. They don’t want to hear about women being abused,” he said. Limpopo Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the continuous attacks and killing of suspects by residents. “I call on residents to respect the law by cooperating with our police instead of taking the law into their own hands,” he said. “People who still take part in mob justice attacks will be dealt with harshly.” Ledwaba confirmed that Livubu police were searching for the suspects involved in this brutal murder and asked anyone with information that could lead to their arrests to contact Major-General Rosina Mulaudzi on 082 451 7217 or report to the nearest police station.
