NOBUHLE was left shaken when a magosha dumped her three-month-old baby with her. But she raised the child instead of giving him away. The boy is now six. Nobuhle Lumkwana (52) from Everest squatter camp in Springs, Ekurhuleni, said she met the stranger in the street and they started talking. “She said to me: ‘Have this child, I might return for him one day’,” Nobuhle said. But the mogasha never came back. “I became frustrated when she didn’t come back. But I eventually accepted the boy as my own. It was hard looking after him at first, but I soldiered on. “I was not working. I started collecting scrap metal to support him. This child is a blessing and I don’t want anyone to take him away from me.” Nobuhle said Good Samaritans gave her food and clothes to help her look after the boy. She said it made her heart sore when the boy, whom she calls Simphiwe, told her he wanted to go to school. But she doesn’t have proper papers and he doesn’t have a birth certificate. “I was only given his clinic card. I also want to apply for a grant for him, but I can’t,” she said. Social development spokesman Thabiso Hlongwane told Daily Sun a social worker would be assigned to assess Nobuhle and the child. He said Home Affairs would help the child get a birth certificate, while the education department would assist with scholar transport. “He’ll be registered under the school feeding scheme. Nobuhle will also get food parcels to look after the child at home,” he said. Paseka Letsatsi from Sassa said the agency could only help with the child support grant after the adoption process had been completed.
