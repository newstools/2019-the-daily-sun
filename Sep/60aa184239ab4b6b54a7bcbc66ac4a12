TOURISM and parks agency CEO Johannes Nobunga urged communities in Mpumalanga to understand how kasi tourism changes lives. Nobunga was speaking at a tourism awareness day in Barberton on Saturday. The awareness day started with a drive to the Makhonjwa Mountains. Nobunga said: “If you’re in a position to understand this, you’re in a position to understand that when tourists come to your area, it’s your responsibility to protect those tourists.” Nobunga said it was important that tourists be made to leave their hotel rooms and guest houses and go into communities. “If they want to learn about different cultures, let them go and experience it in townships and rural areas,” he told the People’s Paper. “That’s the drive which we as the agency are pushing right now.” Nobunga said locals had to benefit from tourism in many ways, other than showing tourists their cultures. “The aim of tourism awareness day is to create awareness among societies about the importance of tourism and its social, political, financial and cultural worth and value,” said Nobunga.
