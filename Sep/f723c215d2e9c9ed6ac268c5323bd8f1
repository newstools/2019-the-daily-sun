CAPE Town MMC for community safety Jean-Pierre Smith said more cops would be sent to communities. He said over the past three months, a crime intervention strategy had been successful in Bonteheuwel. Between January and June, more than 44 people were killed in the area, mostly due to gang violence, but since municipal cops were sent there, only one person had died. Smith said 100 neighbourhood safety team members were sent to the area, and the municipality wanted to spread the programme to other areas. But it required a huge budget. “We tried the same intervention in Delft, but it didn’t work because the area is too big for the staff we have to handle. “It will need between 160 and 180 staff to get the same kind of impact as in Bonteheuwel.” Smith said four months ago, the police minister issued a certificate that gave officers more powers, which had helped them arrest more thugs. He said mayor Dan Plato had given him the budget to get more officers. Councillor Ricardo McKenzie said: “Our murder rate over the past two months is something we can be proud of.” Langa residents said they felt much safer.
