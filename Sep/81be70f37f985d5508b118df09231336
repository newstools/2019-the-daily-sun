METRORAIL commuters in Mamelodi, Tshwane will have new trains operating during peak hours to avoid delays. The new trains will start operating during peak hours today. The trains had previously operated during off-peak hours only. Commuters were happy with the developments and believed this would improve the quality of train services. Commuter Elizabeth Lebese (55) said they suffered a lot because of the poor services. “Let’s hope the ordeal of getting to work will be easier now with the new trains.” Elizabeth said she hoped the trains would arrive every 20 minutes to avoid overcrowding. Samantha Mahlangu (23) said: “We want better service from Metrorail. “Bringing in new trains is good, but they must operate better.” She said commuters were tired of apologies from Metrorail. “We hope the new trains will reduce our problems during peak hours as we get stuck on railway lines for hours.” Prasa’s new trains have been running during off-peak hours, weekends and holidays. It got permission from the Rail Safety Regulator last Thursday to run morning trains in Mamelodi. Group CEO Nkosinathi Sishi said: “We’re pleased to receive approval to operate the new trains along Pretoria-Pienaarspoort in the Mamelodi corridor.” He urged commuters to continue to value all government assets, not just Prasa infrastructure, as they supported the country’s economy. Spokeswoman Nana Zenani said the new trains would start operating during peak hours in Mamelodi from today.
