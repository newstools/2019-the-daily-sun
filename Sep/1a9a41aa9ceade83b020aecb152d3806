IAAF President Sebastian Coe has confirmed he has not spoken directly to Caster Semenya after the rule was implemented forcing female athletes to regulate their testosterone levels. The IAAF, seeking “to ensure fair competition for all women”, argued that Athletes with Differences of Sex Development (DSD athletes) - like Semenya - who are born with the “46 XY” chromosome rather than the XX chromosome most females have, would have an advantage in all events. The ruling means that Semenya can no longer compete in events between 400m and mile which has ruled her out of defending her 800m title at the IAAF World Championships in Qatar later this month. In an interview with CNN World Sport’s Amanda Davies, Coe shared his opinion on the ruling and revealed that he would love to see the two-time Olympic champion back on the track. “I hope that she does come back onto the track,” said Coe.
