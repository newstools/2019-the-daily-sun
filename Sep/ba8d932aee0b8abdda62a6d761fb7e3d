SUNSPORT understands that Cavin Johnson, Clinton Larsen and Gordon Igesund are in the running for the vacant Swallows FC coaching job. Fani Madida, the Kaizer Chiefs legend, has been put in charge of training this week, before club chairman David Mogashoa appoints a permanent coach this weekend. This follows Zeca Marques’ sacking after a string of poor results that did not take the famous Dube Birds anywhere near the top of the GladAfrica Championship log. Swallows are currently lying in 12th position in the table. The new owners have ambitious plans and want to challenge for promotion to the Premier Soccer League. Speaking to SunSport yesterday, Madida confirmed that he will not be in charge of any match, as the club have a bye this weekend and would be back in action against Real Kings at the Mpumalanga Stadium on 6 October. The change in their weekend schedule was as a result of TS Galaxy’s continental commitment in the Caf Confederation Cup on Saturday where they will visit CNaPS Sport in Madagascar. Madida, who spoke to SunSport from Richards Bay in KwaZulu Natal, said he will only start conducting training tomorrow while waiting for the new man to be announced on Monday. It appears that Mogashoa is looking for an experienced coach and would not be considering applications, but will be head hunting the man to fix the broken nest. “The new coach will be in charge when we continue with the league in our next game against Kings,” explained Madida. Under Marques, Swallows dismally failed to live up to expectations as they could only manage a single win, a draw and lost three times.
