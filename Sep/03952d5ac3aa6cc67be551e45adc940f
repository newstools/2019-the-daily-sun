THE kidnapping of Amy’Leigh de Jager from Vanderbijlpark, Vaal, gave many cops in Gauteng a wake-up call. Amy-Leigh was snatched in front of Laerskool Kollegepark on Monday morning and her kidnappers demanded R2 million. On Wednesday, cops took to schools in the area to teach pupils the dos and don’ts when they felt unsafe. A demonstration was done by cops and various security companies. Following the demonstrations, a number of whistles were given to pupils to alert those close to them in case of an emergency. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Simon Mofokatsane told Daily Sun they would go to more schools to raise awareness. “Kids are no longer safe. We started the initiative to make sure these kids know how to deal with situations comprising their safety,” he said. Mofokatsane said a number of routines were performed, such as how they arrest kidnappers when they rescue kidnapped kids. “We also did whistle routines, showing pupils how and when they need to use their whistles. It is important that kids are safe at times,” he said.
