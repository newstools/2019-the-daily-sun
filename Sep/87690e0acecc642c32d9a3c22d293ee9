THE South African rugbyÂ  national team have never received so much love playing outside the country. Even though they lost their 2019 Rugby World Cup opening match against the All Blacks on Saturday, thousands of their Japanese fans are still hopeful that Rassie Erasmus' team can go all the way to the finals. On Saturday, Japanese of all hues were clad in the green and gold colours of the Springboks. Some also painted their faces while others sang various Bokke songs. Born in Osaka but now working in Tokyo, Takada Okutama is a die hard Bokke fan. "I love Springboks and I have all their jerseys. They are so brave and they do not fear any team. I will attend all their matches here at the World Cup. I hope they get to the final," said Okutama. This kind of support will surely motivate the SA who were tipped as among the top sides going into the tournament. The Boks' next match is against Namibia on Saturday.New Zealand too enjoy a huge following here in the Land of the Rising Sun.
