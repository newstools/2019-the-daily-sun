A SWITCH of roles for comedian Chris Mapane at this year’s Macufe Comedy Festival will be a great experience for him and his fans. The funnyman, who was the host for the comedy show last year, will swop places and be a performer this year. Chris said playing a different role from the one he played last year would help him give a great performance.  “One of the perks of being a performer is that I get to tell my personal stories, unlike when I’m a host. There’s less pressure,” said Chris.Plus the show being in Free State makes things easy, I can share my stories with people who can relate and have almost the same experiences as me. “And because I don’t perform there regularly, I’ll also get a chance to thanks the fans. People from Free State have been supporting me through everything that I’ve been doing.” The Macufe Festival, also known as the Mangaung African Cultural Festival, is an annual event that takes place in Bloemfontein, Free State. This year’s comedy line-up will feature Mashabela Galane, Skhumba Hlophe, Summary, Salesman, Chris Mapane and up-and-coming talent, Tieho Khakhau. Chris said he was excited to see new comedians from Free State also added in the line-up. The event hosts jazz, hip hop, gospel, kwaito, classical, rock and R&B concerts. Over the years, it has also expanded to subsidiaries such as Macufe Comedy and Macufe Gospel fetivals. This year’s comedy festival will be hosted by Aggrey Lonake at the Macufe Dome (Old Grey Sports Ground) in Bloemoftein on 9 October. This year’s line-up will feature Mashabela Galane, Skhumba Hlophe, Summary, Salesman, Chris Mapane and up and coming talent, Tieho Khakhau. The comedian said he is excited about seeing the new comedians from Free State that are also featured in the line-up. “I usually give new comedians a chance to perform when I’m hosting shows, but it’s usually in Joburg. So having to see comedians from home being given a platform is what excites me the most,” insisted the comedian.
