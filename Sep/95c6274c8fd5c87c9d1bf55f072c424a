President Cyril Ramaphosa has launched “khawuleza", the
district development model in a bid to speed up service delivery to the people.   Ramaphosa addressed thousands of villagers in Zalu Sports
ground in Lusikisiki on Tuesday talking them through what the model is.  He said the model is going to help people and will give a
good system of rooting out corruption.   "It’s the real khawuleza. Our people are tired of words
and promises. They want us to act and act now. They want us to implement what
we have said we are going to implement," said Ramaphosa to an applause.  The model will integrate departments together with one aim
of delivering a service. For example when a school is built, human settlements, education
among other departments will work together.  "Government will work as one unit. We are destroying
the silos and ensuring that we work in a coordinated way.  They will be able to evaluate and monitor progress.  "We have told the nation that in this sixth
administration we want to do things differently. We are going to implement our
plans.  "We will focus on certain priorities. We have
identified seven priorities which we believed are going to be real solutions to
what our country is going through.  The priorities including education, health and basic service
delivery.  "With this plan we are going to fix municipality. If
things are not going to plan, we will point one at the exiting door, I count
myself in that too. No more free riding now. We all must be accountable and
dedicated to the services of our people.    Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma described the model as one plan one budget adding that
it will also help to fight corruption.  "We are going to involve communities as we develop the
plan. Want to work with everybody to be part of this district model. We will
deliver services where needed but we are developing," she said.
