“VUTHA ate my house and everything in it.” These were the words of Violet Skhosana, who believes her house was torched by jealous people. The 38-year-old fashion designer from Temba in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said the house, which she recently moved into, was mysteriously burnt on Sunday morning. She said the fire started in the garage and spread to destroy everything in the seven-roomed house. Among the things she lost were two new fridges, a TV, a sofa, clothes, a DStv decoder, a sound system, her ID, bank cards, five sewing machines, four wedding dresses and her son’s birth certificate. “I lost property worth about R150 000. I suspect it was vutha,” she said. Violet said she’s planning to see a sangoma to get to the bottom of the mystery. WOMAN WHO PAID $100K FOR R.
