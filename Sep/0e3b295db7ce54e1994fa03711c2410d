A "recruiter" who sold three young men to
a Cape Town businessman and tavern owner has been fined R10 000 or two years in
prison, suspended for five years. Cosian Hendriks, 74, recruited his three victims
from Colesburg, trafficking them with promises of employment opportunities,
Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said. The men were picked up by a taxi driver at their
homes in the Northern Cape on July 27 last year and driven to Cape Town. "On arrival in Athlone, they were dropped off
with Hendriks, who sold them off to a businessman and the tavern owner in
Athlone. The three victims were forced into hard labour and stayed in a crude
and unhealthy accommodation," Nkwalase said. "Their pleas to be returned home a day after
their arrival were met with resistance, as they were told to first pay back
costs incurred. The matter was reported to the Athlone police, when the father
of one victim heard about their plight." Following the rescue of the three men, all aged in
their early 20s, Hendriks and the tavern owner were arrested on July 30, 2018. Initially charged with human trafficking, this was
converted to a contravention of the Employment Services Act 4 of 2014. "Consequently, the tavern owner was released
as the victims were saved before they could be exploited," Nkwalase said. SOURCE: NEWS24
