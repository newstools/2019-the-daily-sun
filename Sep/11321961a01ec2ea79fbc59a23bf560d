Makeup plays a big role on any fashion runway, and just as
runway shows showcase the new latest fashion, they also showcase for the beauty
world as well. There were a lot of different shows at New York Fashion
Week, and so were the makeup looks. Just like fashion, these makeup looks will become the next
trends and influence the beauty community in a major way. Here are some makeup trends spotted at New York Fashion
week. 1. Natural “bare” face This makeup look is for ladies who love to achieve the ‘no
makeup’ natural makeup look. These models have fresh, glowing, healthy looking skin,
so do make sure to prep your skin very well when achieving this look because
you will be applying little to no makeup. Brush your brow hairs and wear lip
balm and tiny bit of mascara then you’re good to go. This makeup look is a
great look for summer to look fresh and healthy.    2. Green eye liner Colour eye liner has become a huge trend in the makeup
world, but NYFW, green was the dominant colour. Green looks great on all shades
of skin. Do make sure to keep your makeup on the rest of the face minimal so
the green colour liner can stand out.    3. Black & White smoky eye This look is definitely for those on the more daring side.
Applying a makeup shadow across the entire eye area using only one colour.
Below you’ll see the models wearing black and white, but this look would look
nice if you would experiment with other colours as well.   4. Orange blush There are a variety of different shades of pink to wear as blush;
some do include orange but not always until now. This makeup look substitutes
the pink blush to orange and it looks spectacular.
