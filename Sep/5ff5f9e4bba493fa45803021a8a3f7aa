IT seems 'miracle' performing pastors will soon have a serious competition. More and more people are getting the powers to perform 'miracles', even outside church. A video of a man commanding a car to drive itself in the name of Jesus has gone viral on social media.  In the video, the man is seen telling the BMW to drive back and forth in the name of Jesus. A voice in the background, emulating the voices usually done at churches during ‘miracle’ times, could be heard commending the ‘Man of God’ for the great deed and also, speaking repeatedly in tongues. The man first tells the car to start and then to go. The car appeared to have listened to him as it 'started and drove back and forth'. Whether the car drove itself or not, the guys appeared to have had some serious fun. People all over social media are also loving the video.
