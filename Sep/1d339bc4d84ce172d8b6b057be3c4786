DESPITE prayers being held to stop the killing of women in Cape Town, another family is mourning a loved one. Nwabisa Mthumeni (31) was kidnapped from a shack in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, on Friday. Themba Mtshambela (54) told Daily Sun his daughter was with her boyfriend when unknown people entered their shack, shot at him, and kidnapped Nwabisa.  “I’m hurt because I never thought I’d bury my own daughter. She was supposed to bury me,” said Themba. “I wish government punishes the killers because no parent deserves to lose their child in this way.” A neighbour said he heard gunshots at about 2am on the day of the incident, and Nwabisa screaming.  “The poor woman only cried once and it was quiet after that. Maybe they hit her with something to make her quiet. We couldn’t go out because we feared for our lives.” Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said circumstances surrounding the murder and attempted murder were being investigated. A 33-year-old man was shot at his home in Khayelitsha by unknown suspects.  “His 31-year-old girlfriend was kidnapped and dropped off at Wolfgat Nature Reserve with serious injuries,” he said.  They were hospitalised and the woman died of injuries.The motive was yet to be determined and no one had been arrested yet.
