GOSPEL singer Lulama Dindo wanted assistance to patch things up with her producer. The 48-year-old asked Daily Sun to help her apologise to Bheki Ubisi for not listening to him. Bheki owns BHK Studios in Greenfields in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. Lulama is from Nomzamo Park in Soweto. “Bheki and I fought as I didn’t listen to him. He wanted me to do a DVD recording but I wanted to focus on CD sales. I released Wasifela uJesu in 2014 and still haven’t finished selling copies.” Lulama said her life came to a standstill after their dispute. “I’ve tried looking for other studios but I don’t work well with producers. They look down on me. “Bheki’s one of a kind. He fed me and made sure I was fine. I tried calling him many times but his phone rang unanswered. “Last Friday, he finally answered but I didn’t have the courage to ask him to help me again.” Bheki told the SunTeam he’d be happy to work with Lulama again. “She made work fun. People know how bubbly she is. She is a great person. “She can get in contact with me and we can start working again,” he said. “She misread the whole thing. She calls using different numbers I don’t know. That’s why I didn’t call her back.”
