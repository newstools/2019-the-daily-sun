LIZZY Mokoena’s family is devastated following her murder. The 14-year-old from Kgabalatsane Village, North West, was brutally murdered and then raped on Saturday night. Mum, Salamina Morungoa said she had gone to check on Lizzy after hearing a noise and was shocked to find a man jumping out of the bedroom window. Her daughter was lying on the bed naked, her legs wide open. The man managed to flee but dropped his hat. “He was wearing a red top and khaki pants. It looked as if he strangled and raped her when she was already dead. I didn’t hear any screaming,” she said. Salamina said she was deeply hurt and shocked by the man’s cruelty. She swore not to rest until her daughter’s killer had been caught and sentenced.
