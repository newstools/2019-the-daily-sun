Doctors have warned that using your phone while you poop might give you piles. Piles is another term for hemorrhoids and they are collections of inflamed tissue in the anal canal. They contain blood vessels, support tissue, muscle, and elastic fibers. The Sun reported that a recent study revealed 57 per cent of people admit to using their phone on the toilet, with eight per cent saying they "always" do it. This is because if you're on your phone on the loo, you tend to be sat there for longer - meaning pressure increases on the veins of the anus in the lower rectum. "It’s hard to know how many people have piles – mostly because so many people suffer in silence."But they’re certainly common – estimates range from 1 in 20 to 1 in 4 adult Brits." says Dr Sarah Jarvis,  GP and Clinical Director of patient.info "Constipation and straining to poo is a major risk factor for piles – being pregnant, chronic cough and getting older also factor."But so too does prolonged sitting on the loo. And while in the past, some of us took a good book into the toilet with us, these days it’s more likely to be the ever-present mobile phone."So tempting while it may be to scroll through your apps while you’re waiting to perform, doctors don’t recommend it." she added.
