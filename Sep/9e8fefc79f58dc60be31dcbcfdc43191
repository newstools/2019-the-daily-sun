JOMO Cosmos are on the move again. Cosmos owner coach Jomo Sono revealed that venues are expensive in Gauteng. That is why they decided to take their next three GladAfrica Championship home matches to Limpopo. Ezenkosi, as Cosmos are affectionately known, played their recent home game at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday, where they lost 2-1 to Real Kings. For the past five seasons, Cosmos have been changing their home venues at an alarming rate. They have also played at Tsakane Stadium in Brakpan and Olen Park in Potchefstroom. Last season, they used Vosloorus Stadium as their home ground and Tembisa’s Makhulong as their alternative venue. This season, they have already shared Dobsonville with Swallows FC and Sono stressed that they cannot afford it. He said: “We are going to Giyani because we don’t have a venue. It is too expensive to play here.” Makhulong is also the home of Highlands Park, who are campaigning in the PSL. Sono explained: “Makhulong and Vosloorus, we cannot get those two. We don’t know what is the problem there. “We are not permanently moving there. We are going for three games only for now while still trying to find a way. What can you do if you do not have the venue? “We will keep on moving as long as we are playing. But if we get more support there, we will stay.” The change of venue seems to have affected their performance, considering they have yet to win this season after four matches. They have three draws and one defeat, which leaves them in 11th position on the log. But that does not worry Sono, who said it is still too early to panic. Newbies JDR Stars have been having their great time in GladAfrica as they continued with their impressive run, which sees them topping the log with eight points. Swallows also recorded their first victory at the weekend when they came from behind to beat Royal Eagles 3-2.
