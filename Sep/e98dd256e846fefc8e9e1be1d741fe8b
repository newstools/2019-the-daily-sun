A little over a year since rapper Mac Miller died, three people
have already been arrested for his death. On Thursday, a third suspect whose name is Stephen
"Stevie" Walter was arrested in connection with Mac’s death on Monday,
23 September. The rapper whose real name is Malcolm James McCormick was killed by an overdose of drugs and was found
dead at his home in Los Angeles last year, 7 September. Walter is allegedly a drug dealer, who is said to have
provided the drugs that killed Mac. A post-mortem showed that the rapper was
killed by an overdose of cocaine, fentalyn and alcohol. Fentanyl is one of
the most powerful opiate-based painkillers, used to treat chronic pain patients. TMZ showed conversations between Mac and a drug dealer
called Cameron James Pettit. This was two days before Mac’s death, the rapper
was asking for drugs from him. Pettit then contacted Walter, asking for the
drugs that Mac requested. Walter sent a runner called Ryan Reavis to give Pettit
the drugs and that’s how the drugs got to Mac. Pettit was arrested about two weeks ago and Reavis was
arrested earlier this week.
