A manhunt for 13 awaiting trial prisoners, who broke out of
the police holding cells in Seshego, outside Polokwane, continues, two days
after they escaped during a routine visit.  A dedicated task team, comprising detectives, Crime
Intelligence and crime prevention officers, has been established to locate the
escapees, police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said.  The prisoners, who were arrested for businesses robberies
and the contravention of the Illegal Immigration Act, were identified as
Jeffrey Sekunda, 40, Alex Chinengo, 26, Usher Hamadanisa, 27, Edmore Madzudzu,
34, Concelia Musengeni, 35, Jeffrey Duvenegwa, 37, Tenashe Moyo, 24, Elvis
Charo, 26, Ida Jana, 20, Cosia Mabena, 19, Ludwick Dube, 19, Luckson
Manyangadzi, 31, and Mishack Brian, 19.  "The police are appealing to members of the community
to assist them with any information that can lead to the rearrest of these
escapees," Ngoepe said.  "They are advised not to approach or try to arrest them
but, instead, to contact Colonel Simon Mogale at 071 479 2329 or the Crime Stop
number 08600 10111 or the nearest police station."  The incident was subject to an ongoing internal and criminal
investigation, he added.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hunt-on-for-13-prisoners-who-broke-out-of-police-holding-cells-20190908
