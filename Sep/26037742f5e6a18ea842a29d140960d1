A MAN from Nyanga is expected to appear in the Athlone Magistrates Court today. This comes after he and another suspect allegedly shot at cops who wanted to arrest them on Saturday morning. Police bust the man, but the other suspect fled. Nyanga resident Mandla Tukwayo told Daily Sun he heard gunshots but didn’t know what was going on. “It’s normal to hear gunshots here. I didn’t even bother to check, but was later shocked to hear that it was an exchange of gunfire between cops and thugs,” he said. Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the incident happened while cops were patrolling the area. He said cops approached two armed thugs and ordered them to drop and surrender their guns, but they refused. “Instead of surrendering, they shot at the police, who quickly responded by firing at them and injured one, while another one escaped,” said Traut. He said cops confiscated a loaded 9mm pistol from the man. Last week, Police Minister Bheki Cele warned thugs against attacking cops as it amounted to attacking the state.
