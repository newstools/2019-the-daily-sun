A dad has been arrested after a video of him hitting his
baby daughter went viral. The man was arrested after the video of him hitting the
child on the face because she couldn't stand on her own. The dreadful clip also shows him hanging the toddler by her
arms and holding her by her ears before dropping her to the ground in a cruel
attempt to make her stand up. According to TheNewArab, the man has been identified as
Yousif Alqutai, in his 40s has since pleaded for forgiveness and insisted the
video was filmed four years ago. He added: “As you can all see now, she is perfectly fine. I
tried to teach her to walk and now look by the grace of God she walks by
herself.” But he has been condemned after the footage resurfaced on
social media at the weekend, with police arresting him.
