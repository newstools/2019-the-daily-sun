“No man is
born a rapist, a woman-batterer or a murderer.” These were
the words of Presidnt Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday addressing the Joint Sitting
of Parliament on the crisis of violence in South Africa. Ramaphosa
said Cabinet has agreed to make R1.1 billion available to fight gender-based
violence. According
to Ramaphosa the money will not be borrowed but the funds for the programme
will be raised from within the current budget allocation and will not require
additional borrowing. Ramaphosa
said men and boys are exposed to violence at a young age, some becoming victims
of violence themselves. “The
phenomenon of absentee fathers means that boys often grow up without positive
role models and positive expressions of masculinity, leaving them at the mercy
of the streets, and susceptible to involvement in crime and gangs,” he said. The
president added that the perpetrators of these crimes are the products of a
brutalised society, a society still suffering the effects of centuries of
dehumanisation. Ramaphosa
said Mzansi must break the cycle: “As men we must play an active role in the
movement against gender-based violence. We must lead by example in showing
women respect and decency.” He said
there must be positive role models to the sons and our daughters in South
Africa. According
to Ramaphosa, the R1.1 billion is expected to harness the Youth Employment
Service initiative in order to recruit young South Africans to boost staffing
at police stations, shelters and counselling centres. He pleaded
with the private sector come on board to fund and capacitate rape crisis
centres at hospitals and clinics, and victim support centres at police
stations.
