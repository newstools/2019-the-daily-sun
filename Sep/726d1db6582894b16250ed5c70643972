Sentencing proceedings against former police Crime
Intelligence head Richard Mdluli and his co-accused Mthembeni Mthunzi were set
to begin in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Thursday. On July 30, Mdluli and Mthunzi were found guilty of
charges relating to the 1999 kidnapping and assault of Oupa Ramogibe. Ramogibe
was married to Mdluli's former lover Tshidi Buthelezi. Judge Ratha Mokgoatlheng delivered the judgment. Based on the evidence, that Mokgoatlheng listened
to for more than four years, he found Mdluli guilty of four counts of
intimidation, two counts of kidnapping, two counts of common assault and two
counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mthunzi was found guilty of two counts of
kidnapping, two counts of common assault and two counts of assault with intent
to do grievous bodily harm. They were both acquitted of the intimidation of
Buthelezi's friend Alice Manana, and defeating the ends of justice. Mdluli had a long-term relationship with Buthelezi
dating back to his school days. During her relationship with him, she met
Ramogibe and they began a relationship. They eventually got married on July 22,
1998. Between 1997 and 1999, Mdluli allegedly went to
extreme lengths to track down Buthelezi and Ramogibe. Mdluli and Mthunzi
allegedly kidnapped and assaulted Ramogibe. He was shot dead in 1999. No one was ever convicted of Ramogibe's murder.
Mdluli was accused of sabotaging the investigation. SOURCE: NEWS24
