TWO friends who died in mysterious circumstances two weeks ago were buried at the weekend. Bodies of Lungani Hobyane and Phontsho Kwenaite, both of whom lived in Pienaarspoort in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, were found by divers on 4 September. They were retrieved from a small dam in Cullinan in Tshwane, several kilometres from their homes. The 13-year-olds had been missing for four days. The boys were buried in separate funerals on Saturday: Lungani at Mphakati Village, near Malamulele in Limpopo, and Phontsho at Lefiswane, near Hammanskraal north of Tshwane. Their families were still waiting for post mortem results. Lungani’s mum Freedom (41) told Daily Sun: “I’m healing buthave not found closure on how my son died.” She said she dreamt about her son after the funeral on Saturday. “He told me he had found a place next to his grandmother. He told me I must pray hard for the killers to be found,” said Freedom. Lungani’s aunt Nokuthula Mahlangu (31) said the family needed to undergo counselling, and that foul play was suspected. Nokuthula pleaded with police to investigate. “We need help in finding the criminals who killed our child. “The mood is not good. We still can’t believe Lungani is gone.”
