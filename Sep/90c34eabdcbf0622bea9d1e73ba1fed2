THE students of the University of Zululand have mobalised and took to the streets. The students are taking a stand against crimes they are faced with at off campus residences. In the early hours of Sunday morning one of the UNIZULU students was shot at an off-campus residence. Students took to social to voice their concerns saying off campus students are not safe and the university is reportedly not responding to the issue. “We are tired, local members of the community are safe except for students.” “Students at the University of Zululand are dying daily but nobody is helping because it's situated in the rural areas unlike UCT and Wits. Burglars are breaking into the student residences and take the students' belongings. When we deny, they shoot us,” Mlambo who is one of the students said.
