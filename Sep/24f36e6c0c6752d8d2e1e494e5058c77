As the tensions seem to have died down after attacks on foreign nationals in Gauteng, some have decided to leave the country fearing for their lives. Today Migrants from Mozambique and Zimbabwe in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni boarded busses to their respective countries of origin following recent xenophobic violence. Before the busses headed out, victims and faith based organisations leaders and the community members gathered for a short send-off prayer.  Ekurhuleni Speaker Patrica Khumalo was the MC at the prayer service, on behalf of Ekurhuleni conveyed condolences to the Issac’s family and people of Zimbabwe.  During the prayer, the body of Issac Sithole 35, who died during last week’s attacks in Katlehong was also brought to the church. Issac was killed after he was allegedly beaten and set alight by the residents in Mandela, Katlehong, leaving his wife and their newborn baby who’s just six weeks old.  The brother to the deceased, Langton Sithole said, “Since from that day, I still can’t eat, I’m very unhappy. My brother was fit and well, he wasn’t even sick.” Earlier, Mozambique and Zimbabweans nationals boarded busses at two community halls in Katlehong, Tsolo and DH Williams Hall. Mozambicans at DH Williams Hall were seen picking up clothes as they prepared to board into busses. About 150 Mozambicans boarded three busses. While in Tsolo, over 90 Zimbabweans boarded two busses. When the busses left the area, they drove to Mandela kasi for a quick ritual as the family collected the spirit of Issac. There were mix feelings in Mandela as the busses left the area. Some were heard saying they will miss their foreign neighbours, while some were saying they should leave and never come back.
