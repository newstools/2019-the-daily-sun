Maditla was found guilty at a high court sitting in Middelburg, Mpumalanga yesterday for murdering her children in Klarinet, Emalahleni, in December. NPA spokeswoman Monica Nyuswa said the mum was found guilty of the premeditated murder of Minenhle (8), Blessing (7), Shaniqua (4) and Ethen Maditla (11 months). Maditla has been in custody since she handed herself over to police. During her previous court appearance, the court heard Maditla allegedly had an argument with the father of two of her kids after finding him with another woman. She then later bought rat poison on her way home and put it on her kids’ food. On the day of the murders, she had called relatives on 30 December, telling them to go check her house. They reportedly went there and were met by a gruesome scene. They found the children’s bodies wrapped in blankets inside the house. Maditla tried to kill herself by taking the poison she gave her kids when she handed herself over to police. Her lawyer Jabulani Maphethe had told the court in previous hearings that based on the gravity of her crime, it was proper that she got evaluated by mental health experts. After attending several court sessions, Maditla was finally sent for psychiatric evaluation at Sterkfontein Hospital. She was declared fit to stand trial. In June, her uncle Kevin Balance told the media they felt very bad as she had been denied bail for some time. Kevin said they had forgiven her a long time ago and realised she made a mistake because she was not in her right mind when committing the crime. He said she had apologised to the family through a letter and that they would support her all the way during her trial. The case will be heard again today for arguments on sentencing.
