It's throwback Thursday and it looks like this week's throw back of the week award will be taken be Basetsana Khumalo. The media mogul and business woman came ready to outdo everyone with her throwback of more than three decades ago. She proved that even in her school days, beauty was her thing. Her rise to prominence started twenty nine years ago in 1990 when she was crowned Miss Soweto and Miss Black South Africa at the age of 16. Four years later in 1994, she was crowned Miss South Africa and in the same year she was the first runner-up to Miss World. Recalling her hey days, the star wrote on her Instagram:"O reng masebotsana! Let's Throwback to 1985 when I won my first beauty pageant Miss Helio; it was a shoe shop.Back in those days you would win either a combo (two-plate stove and a kettle) or a fridge or lounge suite with a room divider. Don't laugh, that was a big deal!". She also used the platform to promote her upcoming memoir, which will delve more into her life. "How times have changed. These are some of the stories and anecdotes I write about in my Memoir. Bassie: My Journey of Hope will be available at all bookstores nationwide on the 6th of October," she wrote.You can also preorder the book at: www.bassiesbook.com O reng masebotsana!
