CHILD support grant recipients will receive an increase tomorrow. But not everyone is happy with the hike. The increase is only R10! Mothers who spoke to Daily Sun said the increase should be at least between R50 and R100 for it to make a meaningful change. Nomthandazo Maresi, an unemployed mum from Leiden in Delft, Cape Town said: “That amount is too little. “Prices of food, uniform and transport have increased. “Adding only R10 will not help us. We need at least R50, then we can say there’s change.” Nobesuthu Sizani said she had two kids who got grants, but most of it went towards school transport. “I pay R700 for each child for transport and it means there’s no money for food. I’m not saying the overnment must pay for everything, but R10 is not enough for our needs,” said Nobesuthu. Nolubabalo Ben from N2 Gateway, also in Delft, said: “The government is playing games. They can’t increase the money with only R10. At least R100 can change our children’s lives.” Sassa’s Western Cape spokeswoman, Shivani Wahab, said social grant beneficiaries were informed that both the child support grant and grant-in-aid grants would increase to R430 per child per month as from 1 October. “This is in line with the announcement made by Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni in the Budget speech earlier this year,” said Wahab.
