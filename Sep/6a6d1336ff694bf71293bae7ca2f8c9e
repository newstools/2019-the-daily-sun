FORMER North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has opened a case of extortion against two top politicians to protect his children and family. His action came after a Sunday World wrote an article stating he was involved in North West businessman’s Wandile Bozwana’s death. “This is affecting my family. My children are being taunted. People are telling them their father is a thief and a killer,” Mahumapelo said yesterday. Mahumapelo said he decided to open the case as he wanted to clear his name. “I want to give this matter the proper context so that South Africans can understand where this comes from,” he said. North West Hawks spokeswoman Hlangelani Rikhotso confirmed that a case of corrupt intent was opened by Mahumapelo in Klerksdorp on Tuesday. Mahumapelo said during the ANC conference in Cape Town in 2015 North West Public Works MEC Oageng Molapisi, MEC for transport at the time, came with former board chairman of North West Transport Investment Themba Gwabeni to his hotel room. He said they told him there were big bus tenders at North West Transport Investment. “They said because I was the premier they have secured 25% of those tenders. I chased them away and told Molapisi that we took an oath of office when we joined government and that I did not want to be involved,” he said. Mahumapelo said a month later the North West Business Forum was formed, where Bozwana and Gwabeni were members. “People wanted to entangle me in corruption. They were going to hold it against me because they will have evidence against me,” “I then decided I was not going to be part of it,” he said. He said he would give full details in court.
