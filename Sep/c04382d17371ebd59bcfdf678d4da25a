COULD Kaizer Chiefs’ captain Bernard Parker be the difference between Amakhosi and AmaZulu on Tuesday? Judging by his performance, the skipper seems to be reserving his best form for Usuthu, having banged in eight goals for Amakhosi in their last 12 league encounters with the coastal side. The 33-year-old is yet to score in five matches this season but could well add to his goal tally when Amakhosi visit King Zwelithi Stadium on Heritage Day (3pm). “I can be important for the team’s success,” said Parker. “In terms of performance, I need to remain consistent. To add on top of this is to get a goal, which I definitely want. We have shown character in two of our games where we came back from behind and won. “We will go into this match with the same level of energy. We know how important these three points are in keeping us at the top.” Of greater importance is for Ernst Middendorp’s men to bounce back after they suffered their first defeat at the hands of Polokwane City last weekend. Chiefs have been dominating this fixture for some time, having lost just once in their last 24 matches, including a 6-0 thrashing in 2012. However, it would be a tricky encounter as AmaZulu will be under the guidance of new coach Józef Vukusic. Vukusic replaced Cavin Johnson, who was fired this week. And naturally, players will be looking to impress the new steward and earn regular game time. However, Vukusic is not bracing himself for a baptism of fire, as it won’t be his first time facing Chiefs. Just last season, he collected four points from the Soweto giants, as he guided Rise and Shine to an astonishing top-five finish in the league. A win against Amakhosi will certainly ensure him a perfect start to his tenure, as he faces the massive task of resetting Usuthu after their false start to the season.
