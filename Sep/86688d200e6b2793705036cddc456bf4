THE Hawks in Mpumalanga have issued a warrant of arrest for the spokesman of provincial ANC chairmanship candidate, Peter Nyoni. Mohammed Phiri (35), who in the past two years campaigned tirelessly with Nyoni for the Mpumalanga ANC to be disbanded, is being sought for fraud. He allegedly swindled a tenderpreneur of R270 000 in June 2015. According to Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the victim was promised a partnership in a project in Limpopo. Sekgotodi said the money was allegedly paid to Phiri as capital for operating costs of a non-existent multimillion-rand tender to supply water pipes to the Polokwane Municipality. “Phiri reportedly disappeared soon after receiving the money. A warrant for his arrest was issued on Monday,” she said. The suspects later withdrew R5 000 from her account.
