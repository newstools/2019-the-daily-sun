SOPHIATOWN is brought back to life in this 1950s theatre play. This kasi was famous for its high life of shebeens, politics, gangsterism, journalism, the arts and well-known writers. The play, to be staged at The South African State Theatre, will recreate life back in the day. Eight occupants livetogether under one roof in the spawling township. Lead actor, Edward Langa, who plays Jakes Mamabolo,explained: “Jakes, who’s in his early 20s, is a journalistworking on a scoop that’ll make him famous. “He places an advert in a local magazine, looking for a white person who wants to rent a place in Sophiatown. A young white girl named Ruth sees the ad and moves into the house. “Jakes uses journalism as an escape route from a life ofthuggery and gangsterism,” said the actor. According to Edward, the play aims to retell thecosmopolitan story ofSophiatown. “The aim for inviting a white person to live in Sophiatown was so Jakes could write the most exciting story and finally get his major break. “So, he looks at how these eight different individuals live together and how difficult or easy living with Ruth becomes,” he said. “Unfortunately, Jakes falls in love with Ruth and is caughtbetween a rock an a hard place, writing a big story about a white girl living with blacks in the township and choosing love.” Edward said people will have an opportunity to see how lives were destroyed by the forced removals of that era. The play premiered on 13 August and will be on until 15 September.
