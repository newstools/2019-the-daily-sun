VIVIAN Mhlauli (56) loved her Ben 10 – but he wasn’t providing for her. Instead, the Ben 10 told her to go out and hustle for them both. This led to Vivian, from Vusimuzi section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, falling in the arms of 74-year-old Senatla Mmifi. But the Ben 10 didn’t like it one bit. The only way he could think of dealing with his jealousy was to kill the old man! On Saturday, when Senatla threw a birthday party for Vivian, the Ben 10 stormed into the house in Tembisa and stabbed him to death. “He came looking for mkhulu and he stabbed him while we were sitting on the sofa. Mkhulu died in my arms,” she said. Thembi Msimanga, at whose house the birthday was celebrated, claimed the Ben 10 was high. He has been arrested for murder. Angry Vivian said her Ben 10 told her to hustle, which she did. “To hell with him! I will never forgive him. I loved mkhulu. He treated me like his queen.” She met him in February. Apparently the madala was planning to take her to the Eastern Cape to meet his family in December. Senatla’s relative, Keletso Makola, told Daily Sun they wanted justice. Captain Manyadza Ralidzhivha said the suspect made his first appearance in the Tembisa Magistrates Court on Monday.
