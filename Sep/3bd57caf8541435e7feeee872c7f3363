DAVID Molefe’s family have pleaded with him to come home. David (49) has been missing for almost two years. “We can’t stop asking ourselves where he could be,” said Esther (36). Esther from Mandela Village in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane, said David left for work on 15 December 2017. He lived on a plot near the Tshwane CBD. “We called all the people we thought he could have been with, but no one had seen him,” said Esther. They didn’t know where David worked and he left his 14-year-old son behind. “We’re worried about his whereabouts. He’s never called any family members.” Esther said they even know his friends. She told Daily Sunthey feared the worst but prayed he was alive and well. The family appealed to those who might have seen David or know of his whereabouts to contact them. “His disappearance has caused us suffering,” said Esther “This is bad. We hope he comes home alive.” Police spokeswoman Captain Sarah Lesabane said: “A missing person’s case was opened at Hammanskraal Police Station for further investigation.”
