AWARD-WINNING Tswana singer Galaletsang “MmaAusi” Lekoma’s joy at winning a Satma was short lived on Saturday night. Her Toyota Wish, with registration number B 961 BIB, was stolen from the parking lot of the Mmbatho Convention Centre in Mahikeng, North West, while she was attending the awards event. She told Daily Sun: “I sent my child to fetch something in the car but when he got there, it was gone. “We had to leave the awards and go sort out everything. SHIMZA'S LUXURY CAR STOLEN! “I opened a case of theft at Mmbatho Police Station and I’m hoping the car will be found.” She said inside were performance outfits, copies of IDs and the passports of all seven members of her team. “We were earlier performing in Tshidilamolomo Village and drove straight from there to the awards. The security guards said they didn’t see anything.” MmaAusi said she was grateful she didn’t leave her award in the car, or it would also have been stolen. She asked anyone who might have spotted the car to call her on 078 880 9360, 073 139 0726 or 076 396 0384 or to contact their nearest police station. Cop spokeswoman Adele Myburgh said a case of vehicle theft was opened and was being investigated.
