DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane believes fellow party members want him booted out. According to City Press, Maimane has been canvassing provincial leaders for their support before the partyâ€™s federal council next month. The council is the highest decision making body. He told the newspaper there was a move to taint him by leaking information to the media to weaken him. This followed stories that he declared a Cape Town house owned by a businessman, who was alleged to be a party donor, a claim Maimane denied. He said the businessman was no longer a donor, but was before he became the party leader. It has now also emerged that Maimane drove around in a car paid for by former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste. News24 reported that Maimane refused to return the car, despite colleagues warning him about possible reputational damage to both him and the party. DA spokesman Solly Malatsi reportedly said the federal executive discussed the issue of the house and were satisfied with his response. Maimane was yesterday not available for comment on the matter of the car, but he told City Press he was not shaken despite approaching provincial leaders seeking their support.
