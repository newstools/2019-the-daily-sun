ABSA Premiership leaders Polokwane City are a team to watch this season. This is the promise made by their head coach Zlatko Krmpotic after his side beat MTN8 finalist SuperSport United 3-1 in an Absa Premiership match played at the Old Peter Mokaba at the weekend. The victory has put Rise and Shine at the top of the Premiership log with 13 points from six league games. City have won four, drawn one and lost one so far this season. And their form under Krmpotic has been impressive. “We are in a good position and we should play to win our coming games without any pressure,” said the 61-year-old Serbian. “We started the season with 13 or 14 players as we had injuries. But all the players, Walter Musona, Puleng Tlolane and Salulani Phiri are back. These are crucial players to us and we are happy to see them back.” Krmpotic says it was a blessing in disguise for them when United coach Kaitano Tembo started with key players Bradley Grobler and Thamsanqa Gabuza on the bench. “To me Gabuza and Grobler are the best players in the PSL at the moment,” said Krmpotic who joined the Limpopo based side this season after he replaced Jozef Vukusic. “We knew we had a chance when we saw those two players are on the bench. United are not the same without these players. We had confidence from the beginning of the game. All we have to do now is to work on our mistakes.” City’s goals was scored by Nicholas Motloung, Tlolane and Phiri while Aubrey Modiba netted the only goal for the three time PSL champions.
