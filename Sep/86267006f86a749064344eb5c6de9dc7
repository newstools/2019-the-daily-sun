A woman, who paid for R. Kelly's bail money to secure his release  in February wants her money back, but the judge presiding over the case is refusing. Valencia Love paid $100 000 for the star's bail, who was facing multiple sexual assault charges. Now it seems the woman has changed her tune and wants her moola but - but she is not getting it. According  judge Lawrence Food, Valencia signed papers that indicate she could lose it. Love’s lawyer John Collins said in court Tuesday that she didn’t know when she paid 10% of a $1 million bail that Kelly would be charged federally and land in federal jail. Collins said Love now fears losing all the money as charges against Kelly stack up.But Judge Lawrence Flood read sections of papers Love signed warning the bond money could be used for Kelly’s legal fees and that she may never see it again.
