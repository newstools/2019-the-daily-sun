Eskom is not planning load shedding in September and
October, the power utility said in a statement on Thursday.  It issued the statement in response to allegations by
opposition party the Democratic Alliance that municipalities had been warned
about the possibility of imminent rolling blackouts. In a statement, the party
claimed to have received "reliable information". DA spokesperson on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone had
said the party wrote to Eskom chairperson Jabu Mabuza asking for clarification
on the matter.  In its statement on Thursday, Eskom said it "would like
to assure its customers that there is no planned load shedding expected in
September or October as indicated by the Democratic Alliance".  "We have not communicated to any stakeholder that there
will be load shedding," it added.  "The risk, however, remains, as the system is still
tight and vulnerable as we ramp up plant maintenance."  Early this month, Eskom said it will attempt to avoid load
shedding in the coming summer months, but warned that plant maintenance which
often takes place during the summer time may trigger outages. The company late
last year implemented load shedding, as it battled low coal stockpiles and
systems breakdown. Interruptions were again experienced at the beginning of
this year.  Government has announced that the debt-ridden power supplier
would be split into three entities, in a bid to improve efficiency. Eskom
supplies about 95% of the country's electricity, and is struggling with a
R440bn debt.  https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/eskom-da-is-mistaken-we-are-not-planning-load-shedding-20190919
