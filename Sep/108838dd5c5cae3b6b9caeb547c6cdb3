GOING five games in a row without a win can bring immense pressure to any football coach, especially when in charge of Chippa United. Siviwe Mpengesi, Chippa’s ill-famed chairman is known for his lack of patience when the results are not coming, could strike at any time and shoot without any warning. But their current coach Clinton Larsen is unfazed by the threat of losing his job, this is despite having not won a match in the 2019-20 Absa Premiership season. Their latest setback was a 2-1 bruising by Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium where Tshegofatso Mabasa scored a brace to pin the Chilli Boys outside of the top eight. In reality, there’s no doubt that Larsen must start panicking as pressure mounts on the coach who is running around on a two-year contract extension, which was signed in June. However, Larsen says he is feeling under no pressure: “There’s no pressure at all… none at all. None whatsoever.” “Nobody thought I would last for a month,” he added. “I’ve been here for eight months now. I remember when I arrived, one month into my tenure, I was told not to unpack my bags. “We will see how it goes but so far, I am happy with the support I have been getting from the chairman.” When quizzed about his secret to having survived this long, he stated: “It is just the way I work with people. There’s transparency in everything. How I deal with my players, technical team and backroom staff.” The 48-year-old Larsen now shifts his focus to their next two league fixtures against Bloemfontein Celtic at home on Saturday and Maritzburg United on Friday 27 September, which he feels they need to get six points. “We need to make sure that we get the business done against them,” he said
