KGOSHI Swaartland Tau from Sakhelwe in Dullstroom, Mpumalanga, together with Kgoshi Ndabezitha Mahlangu held an imbizo yesterday for the youth about heritage and culture. Tau raised his concern over nyaope taking over the kasi streets. He said if today’s generation understood their heritage and traditions, they wouldn’t be facing the challenge of nyaope. “It’s time we start preaching the importance of following tradition to the younger generation, so they can move away from the streets and refrain from using drugs and alcohol,” he said. He said respect among young people has lost its meaning, simply because children no longer were taught about their roots. “We should strive to raise them the way we were, where kids had respect for any adult they came across. Such values, if instilled early, can shape their future.” Mahlangu said they were worried nyaope was now spreading to farms. “We need to act now. Our kids are messing up their lives and we can’t do nothing.” Constable Romeo Mashego said they’re willing to work with the chiefs to get rid of nyaope. William Makoa and Dinah Mohlahlo were grateful the elders wanted to help young people stay away from drugs and said they were ready to be taught more about tradition.
