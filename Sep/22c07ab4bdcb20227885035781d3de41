PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa, once a hero of the workers, has turned on them to work with capitalists. These were the words of general secretary of the SA Federation of Trade Unions, Zwelinzima Vavi. Vavi was addressing Amcu delegates at the union’s elective conference in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, yesterday. TAXI BOSS KILLED LIKE HER HUSBAND! He said the coming law, which would require unions to have a vote by secret ballot to take strike action, would make it tougher for workers to fight for their rights. “We’re now under attack, comrades, as the working people of this country. We’re under a tremendous attack from the capitalist class and their captured state, now led by our former hero Ramaphosa.” Vavi said so many jobs were being lost and shop stewards were turning into full-time retrenchment negotiators. CHILD TO POLITICIANS: YOUR BEST ISN’T GOOD ENOUGH! “Even when we try to score some victories in the Constitutional Court against labour brokers, they bring them through the back door and call them independent contractors,” he said. Vavi claimed the Labour Department was leading the attack on unions. “They have now passed a law, comrades. They’re telling us we have six months from January to amend our Constitution to say before you strike, you must have a secret ballot. ANC PRAISES ‘HERO’ MUGABE “Where have you seen this type of arrogance, a capitalist system, the bosses aided by the capitalist state, led by ANC bourgeoisie telling us, the workers, how we should run our affairs as unions? “So before we go on strike, we’re supposed to erect ballot boxes as if we are the IEC? They are killing us,” he said. Vavi urged unions to come together to fight these kinds of laws.
