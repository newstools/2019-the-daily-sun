Kaizer Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic is enjoying life in the Absa Premiership and believes he has adapted well to the South African league, predicting there is more to come from him in the attacking third. The Serbian forward had spent much of his career in the Slovakian second-tier, and was a left-field signing by Chiefs in the last transfer window. But their investment already looks a good one as he has been a stand-out performer in the early weeks of the campaign, providing assists and looking threatening in front of goal himself. He believes he has combined well with his new teammates as well and says the understanding is coming naturally. “I am enjoying every moment with them, on and off the field. All of them are talented players, Lebogang [Manyama], [Bernard] Parker, [Lazarous] Kambole and everybody,” Nurkovic said at the Chiefs media open day on Wednesday. “I am here for just two months and we have played four games but it is getting better and better with each game. “Obviously as a striker my job is to score goals and I will be happy to score as many as I can. We will see, but I am trying my best and I know how to do it. But it doesn’t matter who scores as long as we have three points because we put the team first. “The goals will come, I am just focusing on doing my best and doing what the coach is asking of me. And as long as I am creating for teammates and playing well, all is good.” Nurkovic says he has been impressed with the quality of the Absa Premiership. “It is a quality league with a lot of quality players. I am enjoying it, I enjoy playing with them,” he said. “We are already used to each other but of course it is a new environment for me coming from another continent, but it is getting better and better.” -SuperSport
