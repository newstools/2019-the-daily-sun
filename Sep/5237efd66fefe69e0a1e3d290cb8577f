THERE has been moments of celebration, madness, disappointment and those of expectation in South Africa. But so far, in sport, we are still hoping to lift a world title, unlike the regional cup trophies that we have won, this country has been through a lot and a trophy will do a trick in bringing about unity. And from today, as the 2019 IRB World Cup kicks off in Japan, our expectation is that the Springboks will tear those irritating All Blacks into small pieces on Saturday. The past 12 months, okay say a year, have been daunting between the two warring rugby giants, and tomorrow another date has been set as they open their World Cup account. Threats of injuries and warnings to referee Jerome Garces have also come into the mix, with All Blacks coach Steve Hansen yesterday warning South Africa’s Rassie Erasmus to lay off the referee as the cold war escalated. This crunch World Cup Pool B clash will certainly determine whether Boks will take this Webb Ellis trophy for the third time, and the All Blacks will also have an indication whether they will retain it or not. We as South Africans must hold hands together and rally behind our Bokke, and say: Slaan Hulle! Since 1921, South Africa has won a reasonable number of matches against the All Blacks, with the latest last year at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington. Their last encounter at Loftus Stadium was separated by two points with Hansen’s charges winning it. But as we say in South Africa: Niyabasaba na? (Are you scared of them), Hhayi asibasabi siyabafuna (no, bring it on). Siyo Shosholoza.
