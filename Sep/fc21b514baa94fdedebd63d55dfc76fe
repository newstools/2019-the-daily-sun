 At least
one in every 10 South Africans believe men have the right to physically attack
their partners or wives. This is
according to an Ipsos poll, following face-to-face interviews with 3 600 people
across the country earlier this year. Ipsos
examined opinions surrounding a woman's place in marital relations and violence
toward women. More than
six in 10 people believed a woman should obey her husband or partner, which
Ipsos remarked illustrated a "deep-seated paternalism and conservative
view in our society, seeing a woman as a possession rather than an individual
in her own right". Slightly
more women than men agreed with the statement, according to the findings. Younger
people were slightly less likely to agree. In the 15 to 17 age group, 51%
agreed. While the
majority - 78% - did not agree that a husband had the right to physically
attack his partner, levels of agreement that physical abuse was acceptable was
still "alarmingly high", Ipsos said. Levels of
disagreement were highest when subjects thought about themselves as
individuals, but decreased when it came to their opinion of what the community
thought. The
information was gathered between March 22 and April 17 following 3 600
interviews with randomly selected respondents. - Compiled
