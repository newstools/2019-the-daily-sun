HER boyfriend called on Wednesday and said she was going to regret it. An hour later, one of her two children lay dead while the other was in a critical condition after the man stabbed them. The mum revealed this to Daily Sun at her parental home in Signal Hill Village in Mahikeng, North West, yesterday. She said her boyfriend, popular jazz DJ Tuelo Kgorosi, did this as he believed she was cheating on him. “He was very jealous and always accused me of cheating on him. He told me I’d never find a man who will love me the way he loved me,” she said. She slept at her aunt’s place on Tuesday night after they had a heated argument. The kids’ gogo said the DJ stormed her home and took the kids without saying a word. Yesterday morning, Tuelo’s body was found by cops in his girlfriend’s car in Modimongwe Village, outside Mahikeng. The kids’ gogo said she was angry that Tuelo, who was not the kids’ dad, took the easy way out. “I understand he might have poisoned himself. He could have just taken the same knife and felt the pain he made those kids go through,” she said. His family were called to the scene yesterday, but they did not want to comment, saying the matter was traumatic. The kids’ mum’s car was found parked under a tree with all its windows open. North West police spokesman Colonel Adele Myburgh said police were investigating cases of murder and attempted murder.
