The family of a South Africa woman is currently receiving
consular services after she was arrested in Mauritius on September 17 for
allegedly smuggling heroin into the country.  Department of International Relations and Cooperation
spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele confirmed the incident but would not disclose
details surrounding the arrest, saying it would be up to the family to speak
about what happened.   Lexpress.mu identified the South African national as
Nokuphila Mtshali who had arrived on the island on September 17 from Reunion
Island. She was allegedly caught with 528g of heroin worth 8m rupees (around
R3.3m).  According to the website, a body search of Mtshali revealed
the drugs were allegedly hidden in her private parts.  After being caught, she reportedly co-operated with the
police, setting up an operation to deliver the drugs that resulted in the
arrest of two more suspects, Nigerian nationals Endubuisi Samuel Ebielonwu and
Eze Collins.  Mthsali was allegedly promised R40 000 for the delivery.  The three accused have already appeared in court on charges
of drug dealing and trafficking.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sa-women-arrested-in-mauritius-for-alleged-drug-smuggling-20190930
