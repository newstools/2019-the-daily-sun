GOLDEN Arrow commuters were happy when cops arrived to monitor buses yesterday. This came after a spike in robberies in areas of Cape Town such as Khayelitsha, Nyanga, Philippi and Mitchells Plain. Nozibele Notywanya from site B in Khayelitsha said: “Even young boys who are learning to rob target buses because they know nothing will happen to them. “I’m glad something is finally being done to protect commuters. People had to hide their phones on the bus, knowing thugs could pounce at any time.” Khanyisa Madolo from Nyanga said thugs targeted buses which operated late. “They know it will be an easy task from them as there won’t be many people on the bus. Most of the time the drivers can’t do anything because they also fear for their lives,” said Khanyisa. Safety and Security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith said 20 cops were sent to the buses. “Golden Arrow approached. The company said attacks on buses had become worse and affected the confidence of their commuters,” he said. The bus company’s general manager Derick Meyer said he hoped the initiative would help commuters. “We appeal to commuters to give these officers their full support as we remain committed in our fight against crime,” he said.
