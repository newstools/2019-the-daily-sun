FASHION designer Nkateko Khoza was left with a small table and chair after looters attacked her shop on Sunday. Nkateko is Yvonne Chaka Chaka's daughter in law. Her shop in Maboneng, Joburg, was one of the businesses looted by a marching mob. Ntateko, known as Lufi-D, told Daily Sun she was doing a photoshoot in the CBD when she received a call.  “I was told to rush to the store as people had broken into my shop and were helping themselves to my stock.  Nkateko said: “I’m looking at a loss of more than R250 000 this month, and I’m still expected to pay my employees a salary at the end of the month.  “I’m a small business owner. These people don’t understand what they have put us through.” Nkateko has dressed a number of celebrities, including Yvonne Chaka-Chaka. She specialises in tailored suits and tuxedos, using vibrant African prints.
