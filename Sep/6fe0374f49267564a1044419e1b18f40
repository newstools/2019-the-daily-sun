Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania ~ THE country is refusing to provide detailed information on suspected Ebola cases, the World Health Organisation said in a rare public rebuke as the region struggles with an outbreak already declared a global health emergency. Transparency and speed are key to fighting the deadly haemorrhagic fever because it can spread rapidly. Contacts of potentially infected people must be quarantined and the public warned to step up precautions like hand washing. The organisation said on Saturday that it was made aware on 10 September of the death of a patient in Dar es Salaam, and unofficially told the next day that the person tested positive for Ebola. The woman had died on 8 September. “Identified contacts of the dead were unofficially reported to be quarantined in various sites in the country,” said the organisation. It said it was unofficially told that Tanzania had two other possible Ebola cases. One had tested negative and there was no information on the other. Officially, the Tanzanian government said last weekend it had no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola. The government did not address the death of the woman directly, and did not provide further information. Officials in Tanzania’s health ministry could not be reached for comment. – REUTERS
