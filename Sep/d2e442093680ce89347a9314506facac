RECENTLY retired Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo says he needed to quickly accept that he was not going to play and failure to do so, would have resulted in him living in pain. Khuzwayo was forced into an early retirement at the age of 29 after he suffered an ankle injury during the off season with Pirates in 2018. This injury just occurred few months after he left Chiefs and it ruled him out without playing a single match for Pirates in the PSL. “The moment I accepted this, I knew I’ll live freely,” said Khuzwayo. “I need to accept anything that comes my way so that I can have a better understanding. With this I know that I’m inspiring someone if I keep going, be strong and show resilient.” The former Thanda Royal Zulu keeper is no stranger to tragedy. He was involved in a car accident with his wife, which resulted in her losing an arm. He added: “If I crumble down, what about my kids and they will look at their father as weak. In life, everyone has problems. How you fix them, makes you a better person.” Khuzwayo, who was born in Umlazi, joined Chiefs from Usuthu in 2012. He only played 37 games for the Amakhosi before deciding to part ways after six seasons as he was tired of playing second fiddle to Itumeleng Khune. In his PSL career, Khuzwayo won two league titles, one Nedbank Cup and also one MTN8 trophy. While he earned only four caps for Bafana, he was part of Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba’s side that participated in the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) in 2015 in which they failed to win any of their matches in the group stages.
