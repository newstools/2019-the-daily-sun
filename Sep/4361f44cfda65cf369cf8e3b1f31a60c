RESIDENTS of Philippi Browns Farm, Cape Town, joined the family of Yonela Ndzantsi (20) at her funeral on Saturday. Yonela, an EFF member, and her friend were found murdered in an open space in Samora Machel two weeks ago. Her heartbroken mum Ntombekaya Xawuka (46) said her daughter’s body was found with bullet wounds. “It’s comforting to me that I managed to give her a decent burial,” said Ntombekaya. “My daughter was not a violent person. She wasn’t involved in any bad activities. I want justice for her so that her soul can rest in peace.” Seleka Baka of the EFF said party members marched to the place where Yonela was murdered. “We’ve lost a dedicated member. We’re calling for the killing of women to end. “We plan to go to schools and teach young boys to protect women instead of abusing them,” she said. Michael Twani, an EFF organiser in ward 34, said it was time residents dealt with women killers. “The EFF will do anything to protect women.”
