It’s a difficult position to be the head coach of a country. “We’ll give him all the support he needs.” Mokwena added: “Not because he is a friend of mine but somebody, I have known for more than 15-years. He is the student of the game, he loves football, he is technocrat and because of that, I am sure he will succeed. “He has been with Bafana and the Under-20, he’s got an extensive experience on international football that will give him a good foundation to be able to lead Lesotho and help them with the Chan.” Senong will lead his new team against Zimbabwe in the African Nations Championship (Chan) qualifiers on 20 September.
