CHAOS broke out at the Nebo Magistrates Court outside Jane Furse in Limpopo yesterday. As a 35-year-old suspect was being escorted out after his first court appearance, an angry crowd got into a struggle with police escorting the suspect. Cops had to use force to prevent the crowd from getting their hands on the suspect. The suspect was appearing in connection with the rape and murder of Thandi Mampane (11). He was also facing an additional charge of kidnapping. The crowd, which picketed outside court, screamed at cops to hand the suspect over to them. “The suspect doesn’t deserve the friendly treatment police gave him,” said one of the people in the crowd.  Thandi was found buried in a shallow grave near a stream in Ga-Marishane Village, outside Jane Furse. She was buried on Saturday. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said there was a strong case against the suspect. “That’s why we have the additional charge of kidnapping,” said Ngoepe. “We are confident the chances of the suspect getting bail are slim.” The suspect will appear again in court on 1 October for a bail application.
