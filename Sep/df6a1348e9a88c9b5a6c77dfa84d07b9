SHE didn’t deserve to die like this. These were the words of Sinenhlanhla Ndlovu (28), speaking about the murder of her sister Sinethemba (22). Sinethemba, a fourth-year University of KZN student, was stabbed to death at the annual uMsinga Drift Khana in northern KZN at the weekend. Sinenhlanhla (28) from Encuncwini, Inanda, said she had a missed call from her sister in the early hours of Sunday morning while she was sleeping. “I returned her call, but because of poor signal in uMsinga I didn’t get through,” said Sinenhlanhla. She said she got a call at about 7am from a nurse at the hospital in uMsinga, who said Sinethemba had succumbed to stab wounds.” She said they heard that Sinethemba and 15 other girls, who were hosts at the event, were walking to their accommodation far from the event venue after they couldn’t get hold of the driver who was supposed to take them there. “While walking, they were approached by a group of men who demanded to speak to one of the girls. “The girl refused and Sinethemba intervened. That’s when the man took out a knife and stabbed her before fleeing. “It’s sad that women get killed like this. I was viewing gender-based violence from a distance, not knowing that soon it would be on my doorstep.” Spokesman for uMsinga Drift Khana Arthur Mbhele said they were planning to visit Sinethemba’s family. Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened. “A 22-year-old woman was stabbed by an unknown suspect at Sidakeni Reserve in uMsinga. “She sustained two stab wounds below the left armpit and stomach. “She was taken to hospital, where she died. No arrests have been made.”
