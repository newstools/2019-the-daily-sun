OVERCROWDING at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital has led to a lot of people not receiving treatment. The hospital in Phoenix, north of Durban, which serviced residents from as far away as Inanda, KwaMashu and Bester, was apparently also struggling with a shortage of doctors and nurses. On top of this, the decomposed body of a patient was discovered on the hospital’s roof in May. Ntombizodwa Mchunu (48) from Inanda said she got medication from the hospital. “It’s always full and when you need to see a doctor, you sometimes go home without receiving help,” she said. On Tuesday, DA leaders in KZN visited the hospital. But they claimed they were prevented from entering. Provincial party spokesman for health Rishigen Viranna said: “Despite following all the correct steps for an oversight inspection, we were denied access. “After talks with the office of the head of department, we were told we wouldn’t be allowed in as Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu hadn’t approved the visit.” Viranna said, according to sources, the hospital was experiencing problems as five doctors had left the family medicine department. MEC Simelane-Zulu said: “There are six permanent medical officers and five temporary medical officers responsible for the hospital’s casualty and medical out-patient department. Vacant posts have been advertised and interview processes have begun. “The imminent opening of the Dr Prixley Ka Isake Seme Hospital will alleviate pressure on the hospital.”
