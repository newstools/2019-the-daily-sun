MEMBER of the South African National Defence Force, Moses Plhabyane, uses his two-wheel ride to get to work almost everyday. The rider from Malamulele, in Limpopo, says so far his longest ride was from Malamulele to KZN – a distance most bikers would find difficult to do. Q: What model is your bike? A: The Honda Blackbird 1100 cc. Q: When did you buy it? A: In February. Q: Is it your first bike? A: No, it’s my fourth one. Q: Do you have a licence? A: Yes, I got it in 2015. Q: Why did you choose this colour? A: It is an eye-catching colour. Q: What do you like about your bike? A: It has a cruise control and enough space. Q: Do you have a safety outfit? A: Yes. A helmet, safety suit and boots. Q: How far have you ridden? A: I rode as far as Durban from Malamulele on a rainy day. Q: Does your bike have a nickname? A: Yes. His name is General Taliban. Q: Do you plan to pimp your ride? A: No, I like it as it is. Q: Is it your dream ride? A: No. My dream bike is the BMW K1600. Q: What do you think of other road users? In most cases, motorists don’t take bike riders seriously. But our bikes’ loud noise helps get recognition. My plea to other motorists is simple: Let’s all please share the road wisely. Bullying it is not going to help us solve some of the challenges we have on our roads.  Let’s also reduce speed and check our blind spots at all times.
