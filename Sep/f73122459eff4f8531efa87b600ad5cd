FORMER Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) coach, Moma Medic, is not taking his sacking lying down! The aggrieved Medic is taking legal action against the club. He was fired on Friday, following the club’s internal disciplinary hearing which found him guilty of gross misconduct. This stemmed from his transgression of the contentious Under-23 rule when TTM played against TS Sporting in their National First Division fixture last season. According to the statement released by the club, Medic made a substitution, by taking an Under-23 player, leaving the club with one player for the remainder of the game, which is a transgression of the NSL Handbook, which requires a club to have two U-23 players during the match. “I was not paid my salary (during the play-offs) but I have instructed my lawyers to take the legal route,” said Medic. “I’m aware that the club released the statement to the media but from my side, our side, with my lawyer, will give you the story tomorrow. “I know this came as a shock to everybody, but my statement will be available after Monday. “But for now I’m quiet. I’m still disappointed. I don’t want to talk much but will do in the coming days.” The Serbian-born coach was appointed in February when he replaced Sello Chokoe, who is now the club’s CEO. He immediately made his presence felt when he took the then rookies to the promotional play-offs. Under Medic, they had a good start to the season in the GladAfrica Championship. And his sacking has somewhat come as a shock. Phuti Mohafe, who was Medic’s assistant when the transgression occurred, has since been appointed the team’s caretaker coach.
