CELEBRITIES have come out in support of alleged rape victim Cheryl Zondi. This comes after after Christians of South Africa accused Cheryl of being a slay queen and an opportunist. The association called on the courts to speed up the case of rape and human trafficking accused Reverend Timothy Omotoso of Jesus Dominion International Church. In a briefing held in Arcadia in Tshwane on Thursday, the organisation said it supported Omotoso. The association’s president, Pastor Derick Mosoana, said Cheryl was after the money of pastors. “Cheryl Zondi is a talented actor of a slay queen. We don’t hate her but pray for her eminent deliverance,” he said. Mosoana said almost R2 million remains unaccounted for by the Cheryl Zondi Foundation. Deputy chairwoman of the foundation, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, told Daily Sun on Saturday the foundation had never received any outside funding. “It has been supported by myself and Cheryl’s family from our own pockets. We’ve partnered with Izimvo, Ubuhle Bengcuce and many other organisations.” She said the Omotoso case is before a competent judge. “Cheryl Zondi and the Cheryl Zondi Foundation reserve every right to lay appropriate and relevant charges against Mosoana and his organisation,” said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva. Radio presenter Criselda Dudumashe said: “I support Cheryl. As a mother and sister, I believe in her story, although I acknowledge that everyone is innocent until proven guilty.”
