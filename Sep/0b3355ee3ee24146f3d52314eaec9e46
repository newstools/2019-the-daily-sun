VETERAN actress Xolile Tshabalala is back on the soapie scene after taking a hiatus from the small screen. This time the star will play Dr Senamile Maseko in SABC2’s flagship soapie, Muvhango. Xolile became a household name back in the day when she starred in Generations as the wicked Julia Motene. Now she’s back to shake things up in Muvhango. Speaking about her new character, Xolile said: “Dr Maseko is coming in to shake things up.  “She’s the true definition of never trusting a book by its cover.” She looks professional and put together on the outside, and comes in as the chief’s son, Vhutshilo’s, psychiatrist, but she hides a very dark side to her. “She becomes obsessed with chief Azwindini to the point of kidnapping him. “So she is here to rattle the royal family’s cage.” Xolile told Sunday Sun that her decision to take the role was because, in her words, it sounded juicy. “Dr Maseko is crazy, a psychopath of note who people love to hate, and that is what attracted me to that role – that it was not safe.” The star said being back in the soapie scene felt good because she loves playing interesting and challenging roles. Said Xolile: “I never like taking on roles that will play out for a long period though, so I sometimes like to come back to take on a juicy role, like I did this time”. She said working at Henley Studios certainly felt nostalgic. “It was certainly nice to see all the crew members I had worked with before at Generations.”
