SIX ANC ward councillors and a senior municipal official were left homeless after their houses were torched on Tuesday. Angry residents waiting for Premier Job Mokgoro in Khuma near Klerksdorp, North West, burnt seven houses to the ground. The six Matlosana councillors are Ben Ntaopane, Pogisho Mabedi, Mpapa Qankase, Selina Sithole, Kuna Ponisi and Sebenzile Daemane. The senior official is Hunter Morebudi. Residents blocked roads in the kasi, demanding better services, jobs and the allocation of stands. Community leader Thembile Botman said:  He said it seemed residents became angry after being shot. Botman said burning houses and looting were criminal and barbaric acts. “We were with the premier in a meeting when we got a phone call to say houses were burning. Those who burnt the houses weren’t part of our group,” he said. The premier, who was coming to address residents, was with community safety MEC Gordon Kegakilwe and transport Management MEC Sello Lehari. They were all under heavy police guard.  Residents told Mokgoro they had not had a reply on the memorandum they had submitted to the Matlosana Municipality last month. Mokgoro condemned the torching of houses but committed to attending to their demands.
