People of all ages wear flip-flops, but this type of footwear can cause pain and injury when worn for long periods of time, while walking on concrete or when playing sports, experts warn. That's because flip-flops offer limited arch support and coverage for the feet, orthopedic doctors at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City said.   How flip-flops damage the feet  Because the flat and flimsy shoe bed in flip-flops does not provide adequate foot support for all-day wear, people may be at risk for arch pain, plantar fasciitis and nerve problems. The lack of shock absorption in flip-flops also can lead to pain in the feet, legs, hips and back. Other problems associated with flip-flops include broken toes and toe nails, cuts and germs, the Mount Sinai experts said. Sun damage is another potential issue with flip-flops and other sandals. Anyone wearing this type of footwear should apply sunscreen to their feet in order to reduce their risk for skin cancer. SOURCE: HEALTH24
