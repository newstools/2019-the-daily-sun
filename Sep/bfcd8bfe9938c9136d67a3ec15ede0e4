FAGRIE Lakay has found a new home in Cape Town. The South Africa junior international joins Cape Town City as a free agent after he was released by Bidvest Wits alongside Robyn Johannes and Prince Nxumalo early this week. The former Amajita and Amajimbos star has been sent from pillar to post on various loan spells after being snapped up by SuperSport United in 2015, when he showed plenty of promise while he was still playing for Santos in the National First Division..However, Lakay has fallen somewhat short of expectations, having managed just 26 Absa Premiership starts over the past four seasons at Wits, SuperSport and Ajax, leading to him being omitted from the recent national under-23 squads.
