A second
person had been confirmed dead following a spate of violence that spilled over
to the Johannesburg suburb of Malvern on Sunday. According
to EWN, Joburg Metro Police Department chief David Tembe has confirmed that a
second person has been killed during clashes in the city. Tembe
reportedly said the latest victim was shot in Malvern on Sunday night. Earlier on
Sunday, one person was killed in violence in the Johannesburg city centre, with
police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele confirming that the victim had been
stabbed with a sharp object at the corner of Bree and Plein Streets. Five others
had been injured. A group of
men, some of them wielding sticks, pangas and tree branches, marched through
the city centre after disrupting a meeting in which IFP President Emeritus
Mangosuthu Buthelezi spoke to hostel residents following a week of deadly
xenophobic violence. Makhubele
said 16 people were arrested for public violence and possession of stolen
property before the situation in the CBD, Jeppestown and Hillbrow was
reportedly "under control".  - Compiled
