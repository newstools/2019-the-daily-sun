One of the hitmen allegedly hired by the Mpumalanga tycoon, Sam Chabalala to kill Nkosinathi Ngcogco will spend another weekend in jail after his bail hearing was postponed. The 23-year-old made a brief appearance at the Bethal Magistrates Court today.  The man is accused of killing Sam Holdings general manager, Nkosinathi Ngcogco (30) last Thursday on 12 September.  The incident happened at night at one of Chabalalaâ€™s truck depot in Bethal. Nkosi was arrested by the police while he was hiding in Gauteng after he was paid R100 000 together with his co-accused who is still on the run.  According to sources known to Daily Sun, Nkosi and his partner, were allegedly seen with Sam Chabalala and a female suspect on the hospital's CCTV before Ngcogco's death where Chabalala was admitted allegedly for food poisoning.  Earlier this week the sources revealed the Hawks are still working on linking Sam Chabalala with the murder of Ngcogco.  Ngcogco was allegedly shot eight times while he was on duty. His murder comes days after he gave the Hawks an affidavit relating to an investigation about Chabalala. Another information has surfaced about eye witnesses who saw the murder incident not being reachable.  The source further said the accused is not kept in jail but in a secret place as he is important in this murder case.  Chabalala was arrested on 6 September by the Hawks at the Highveld mall. He is currently out on R200 000 bail facing fraud, corruption, contravention of immigration act, unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Chabalala might also be charged with another case of corruption after a complainant opened a case of missing documents against him.  Mshengu as he is popularly known made headlines when he led a convoy of 72 luxurious cars to the Durban July event this year.  Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman said they are still busy with the investigations and that the other suspect has not being arrested yet. The case will be heard again on Monday.
