HITTING a cow can completely ruin a car and kill everyone inside. But a drunk driver cheated death on Saturday after hitting 15 cows on a road between Clocolan and Ladybrand in the Free State on Saturday. The driver, who was travelling alone on the R26 in an Iveco minibus, was bust after he was allegedly drunk while driving. Witness Lucky Milo said there was blood everywhere on the road. “I just saw meat flying in every direction as the minibus driver tried to avoid hitting more cars, until the vehicle stopped on the side of the road,” he said. “I was sure the driver was dead. “After seeing a cows flying in the air and the minibus swerving, I went to investigate. “The driver had passed out behind the steering wheel with a bottle of beer between his thighs,” he said. The SunTeam tried to speak to the owner of the cows, but with no success. After the incident, residents came out in their numbers to collect meat. Tshidi Mosweu said: “The meat is going to last us until the rest of the year. It felt like Christmas came early this year.” Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said a 36-year-old was arrested for reckless and negligent driving. “The driver hit 15 cows and sustained minor injuries. A police vehicle was also involved but members didn’t sustain any injuries,” he said.
