THOSE who thought Shawn Mpisane is out of professional football administration forever better think twice. The Durban business tycoon is back in the game following some family problems that saw ex-hubby Sbu Mpisane hold on to rights to the Royal Eagles brand, and subsequently a place in the GladAfrica Championship. As previously reported in SunSport, it has come to our attention that Shawn, the owner of the new club Royal AM FC, is in the process of buying a GladAfrica Championship status, and all could be revealed this week. SunSport understands that Joel Masutha, who was initially with Eagles but replaced by Morena Ramorebodi, has continued as Royal AM FC coach and has been in consultation with the chair-lady with regards to the way forward of the club. It was initially reported that Shawn was due to buy the Uthongathi FC status but political tensions destructed the move from taking place. "Shawn has told her players that she is 90-95% sure that she has purchased a new NFD status," our mole said. "The team that played in the play-offs has been retained and most of them are under the pay-roll of Shawn. For now the players and Masutha are just keeping fit at training while waiting to hear from the chair-lady on which direction they will take next." Initial Eagles were keen on appointing Duncan Lechesa, but since he was contracted to Free State State in the NFD they couldnâ€™t get him. Ramorebodi is assisted by Dada Sibiya. Ramorebodi was previously the head coach of Maluti FET. He made his name in that club by shocking Orlando Pirates 4-1 in February 2013 to dump them out in the Nedbank Cup last 32.
