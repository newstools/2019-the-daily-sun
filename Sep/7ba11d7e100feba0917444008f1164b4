THREE Joburg Metro cops have been found not guilty of murdering a journalist. On Friday, the South Gauteng High Court found the state had failed to provide evidence and the three constables were acquitted on all charges including the murder of Godknows Nare (40), who was shot a few blocks from his home in April 2017. 3 METRO COPS BUST FOR MURDER OF JOURNALIST! It is understood that the cops – Lincoln Moloyi, Nhlanhla Vilakazi and Thozamile Mhlanga – were responding to a hijacking at the time of the incident in Florida, west of Joburg. They were all arrested and Ipid investigated the case. At the time, Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said the crime scene was staged to cover the tracks of the police. He said the version of the officers that they were shot at did not make sense. Nare worked at a number of media houses, including eNCA and SABC.
