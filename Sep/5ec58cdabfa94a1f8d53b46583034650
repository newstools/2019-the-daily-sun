THE ANC in KZN yesterday expressed shock at the death of two officials from Umzumbe on Sunday. Branch chairman and councillor Thabani Luthuli (38) and branch spokesman Lindo Mzimela (28) died in a head-on collision on Old Saint Faith’s Road in Port Shepstone. It wasn’t clear where they were heading, but the SUV they were travelling in apparently crashed into a minibus taxi. The taxi driver also died on the scene. Netcare 911 spokesman Shawn Herbst said paramedics declared all three dead on the scene. ANC sub-regional secretary in Umzumbe Howard Msomi said he received a call about the accident while attending an SACP meeting in Joburg. “The party is devastated and shocked by the deaths of the two comrades. “The municipality and local regional leaders visited the families yesterday, and I will visit the family today,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cops responded to the scene of the accident and several passengers in the taxi were seriously injured and taken to hospital. “The driver of the minibus, who was officially identified as Lindelani Mchunu (39), died on the scene. Two other people in the SUV vehicle also died. A case of culpable homicide was opened,” he said.
