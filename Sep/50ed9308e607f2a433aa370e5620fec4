HUNDREDS of people gathered at the University of Western Cape’s main hall yesterday to pay tribute to former Springbok player Chester Williams. Minister of Public Works Patricia de Lille, who’s a close family friend, said she was still trying to come to terms with the reality that Chester was gone. Sharing how she heard about his death, De Lille said she got a call on Friday from Chester’s wife telling her he was in hospital. “I rushed to Panorama Hospital but he just died 15 minutes before,” she said. Jerome Paarwater, FNB Varsity Cup technical advisor and Chester’s friend, said he was humble and disciplined. He said Chester valued his time and managed to take the university’s players to the next level as a coach. Mandla Gagayi, the university’s head of sport, said: “Chester was a simple guy with a big heart. He took interest in seeing everyone achieve.” Chester’s wife Maria said they were heartbroken. She urged student rugby players to focus and win trophies in his honour, as he valued them and they were close to his heart. Maria, flanked by their kids Chloe and Matthew, thanked Gagayi for giving her husband a chance to head the university’s team. Chester was loved by the community and a squatter camp in Paarl was named after him. He used to go there and work with the residents through his foundation. Chester died on Friday after it was suspected he suffered a heart attack. President Cyril Ramaphosa said Chester would receive an official funeral, which will be held at Athlone Stadium on Saturday.
