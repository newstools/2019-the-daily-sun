Natasha Conabeer‚the young Durban woman who died in ICU just
a day after being dumped outside her home may have been poisoned. Her family told TimesLive earlier today that they suspect
their 23 year-old daughter may have been poisoned during the almost three weeks
she was missing. A delegation including KZN premier Sihle Zikalala and
Ethekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda visited the family home in Inanda. Nosipho Goba, Natasha’s aunt, said: “The doctors suspected
poisoning. She also had a large quantity of paracetamol in her body. That is
what they said‚ and they said it affected her organs.” She added that her niece had no visible injuries‚ except for
bruises on her knee and arm. According to reports, Natasha was her mum’s only child. She was last seen
leaving her flat in Morningside to visit her family in Inanda.
