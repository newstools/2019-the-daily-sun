CHESTER Williams, the 1995 Rugby World Cup star who died of a heart attack about a week ago, was buried on Saturday. Thousands of mourners gathered at Newlands Stadium in Cape Town to say goodbye to the former Springboks winger. Politicians who attended the funeral included Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa and Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille, a family friend. Mthethwa said Williams, the first black man to play for the Boks, didn’t let obstacles stand in his way. Former Boks manager Morne du Plessis described Williams as a role model. “He was small in stature but had a lion’s heart,” said Morne. His widow Maria said:  “We’ll continue to do what you and I spoke about. I’m committing in front of all of you to continue the awesome work that Chester started five years ago with the Chester Williams Foundation.” Maria and her husband often visited the Chester Williams squatter camp in Paarl to help with community projects.
