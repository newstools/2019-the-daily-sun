The ANC has launched an investigation after receiving an
invoice for over R100m from a company for 35 000 elections posters, which the
ruling party allegedly didn’t authorise. According to a statement published on Wednesday, the ANC’s
treasurer general, Paul Mashatile, was not aware of this transaction until the
invoice was brought to his attention. "Neither does the treasurer general have any
information about the printed consignment at this stage," said ANC
spokesperson Pule Mabe. "Given the fact the treasurer general, who is the
custodian of procurement matters within the ANC, had not authorized the
procurement of the goods in question, he has instituted an urgent investigation
to establish facts and circumstances surrounding this transaction." Mabe added that in the interest of transparency and
accountability, the ANC has established processes and procedures for
procurement which are communicated to all their service providers for
compliance purposes. "The ANC is determined to ensure that this matter is
resolved. Once the investigation is concluded, a full report will be
released." https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ancs-r100m-bill-for-election-posters-under-investigation-mabe-20190918
