THE terrified 56-year-old woman told Daily Sun she was unable to sleep following the death of her son and son-in-law. The woman from KwaDukuza, on the KZN North Coast, was sleeping with her three grandkids aged six to 10 on Sunday night when she heard a loud knock on the door. “I was frightened. The attackers asked if there were boys in the house,” she said. “I told them I had small children in the house, but they started breaking the windows and kicked the door down. “They were carrying axes and knives and some had guns.” She told the grandkids to hide. “They told me to open the windows because they couldn’t break the burglar bars,” she said.
