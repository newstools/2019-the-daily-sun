 TWO people have lost their lives and two others
critically injured. The incident occurred this morning at Empire road, opposite the BP garage.  The Hillbrow SAPS spokesman, captain Musa Shihambe told
Daily Sun that the Rea Vaya bus driver lost control of the bus, hit the traffic
lights and collided with two other vehicles. “The bus driver was alone in the bus and he was travelling
on the bus lane,” said Shihambe.  He said the father was taking the son to school and the bus
driver had just started his shift.  “It is with great sadness that we keep losing people on the
roads. We send our condolences to the family who’ve just lost their loved ones. Police will keep working and find a solution on how to deal
with these road fatalities,” he added.
