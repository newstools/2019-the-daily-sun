THE Springboks have probably never been as ready as they are for a battle with the All Blacks in a long while. It could be the confidence and self-belief that Rassie Erasmus has instilled into his team since he took over as the Boks coach nearly a year-and-half ago. The Boks have come a long way in that period, moving from losing to lowly teams such as Italy to being genuine World Cup contenders. It may well be down to the winning culture that the three coaches have inculcated in the Boks. It is always refreshing to hear a coach speak like Erasmus about the All Blacks ahead of South Africa’s keenly-awaited Rugby World Cup opener against New Zealand in Yokohama on Saturday (11:45am, SA time) “Our last three matches have ended in a stalemate, one win each and a draw, for an aggregate score of 82-82,” said Erasmus. “You couldn’t say there is a favourite. I think we have a healthy respect for each other’s capabilities. But it will come down to a small moment to decide a big game in the end, I suppose. “Our job is to focus on executing our plan and our skills to the best of our ability and hope that is enough to overcome a New Zealand team that will be doing exactly the same.” Erasmus has named an unchanged team, led by captain Siya Kolisi, to the one that recently beat Japan in a warm-up match, for the Kiwis powder-keg. “We’ve found some consistency and some momentum in a number of ways this season and one of them is in selection,” Erasmus added. “We have 31 players in the squad, any of whom I would be happy to select – as well as standby players back home – but this is a line-up that has worked well as a starting combination and one with real momentum to come from the bench. “They have emerged together over the past 18 months as our game has developed and matured. “We’re continuing to develop and new players are always pushing a claim but we’ve prepared well and we’re looking forward to what will be another extremely close match.”
