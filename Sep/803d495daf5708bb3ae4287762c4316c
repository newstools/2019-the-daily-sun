Almost 400 people were arrested in joint law
enforcement operations which included the SA National Defence Force (SANDF)
around the Cape metropole since Thursday, police said on Sunday. Spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said that 191
wanted suspects were among the 395 arrests made between Thursday and Sunday as
the forces descended around the metropole. Their evidence list includes 391.25 grams of cannabis,
237.30 grams of tik, known internationally as crystal meth, 163 Mandrax
tablets, one firearm, two zip guns, ammunition, and a whopping 75 366 litres of
booze. Working under the codename "Operation
Lockdown", the initiatives began in July as a response to a plea for
intervention regarding serious and violent crime. The SANDF arrived on July 18 amid howls of outrage and
anguish over gang shootings, to provide support to the police and other law
enforcement agencies carrying out arrests and searches. Up to 1 320 soldiers provided support to the police at
a cost of R23.3m, but there is uncertainty over how much longer they will stay. In the meantime, Western Cape Safety MEC Albert Fritz
expressed concern over the Western Cape's apparent lack of facilities to
destroy seized illegal firearms. He said that the weapons are taken to Gauteng to be
destroyed in an operation twice a year. "SAPS recovered 1 037 illegal firearms between
November 2018 and August 2019 in the Western Cape," Fritz said in a
statement on Sunday. "Given the number of firearms and ammunition that
are frequently seized, it is problematic and a threat to the province's safety
that these are only destroyed twice a year." He feared a backlog in destruction could lead to the
firearms going back into circulation. He called on Police Minister Bheki Cele to urgently
develop suitable premises in the Western Cape to fast track the destruction of
illegal firearms in the Western Cape. SOURCE: NEWS24
