Presenter, actress and businesswoman Relebogile Mabotja was driving her family in a Quantum on Sunday when she got the fright of her life. She was stopped by the Faraday Taxi Association’s patrolling squad and threatened! Relebogile and her family were on their way to Rustenburg, North West, when the incident happened. Videos of the incident were recorded by a family member. Relebogile wrote on Twitter that she felt intimidated and threatened. She said she called the cops for help, but they weren’t helpful. She wrote on Twitter: “Do taxis own national roads? Are they the only ones allowed to use Quantums? “Do we have to stop when private vehicles pull us over? I need clarity. “I was in the driver’s seat! My family was not safe! Your people threatened my family. This is completely unacceptable. I’ll never pull over for people forcing me, who are not law enforcement. Never!” Faraday Taxi Association spokesman Linda Makhanya said the patrollers were just doing their job. “All she had to do was stop the car and explain. But what she did was continue driving. We apologise if she felt threatened.” When the SunTeam called Relebogile, she sent an SMS saying she was in a meeting and couldn’t talk.
