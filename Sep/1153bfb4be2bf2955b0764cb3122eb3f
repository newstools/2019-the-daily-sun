BILLIONAIRE businessman bust by the Hawks, Sam Tshabalala,
has apparently fallen ill in custody. According to SowetanLive, the 23 year-old controversial
businessman from Mpumalanga, popularly known as ‘Mshengu’ was admitted at
private hospital in Emalahleni last night allegedly after complaining of
stomach complications. The SunTeam had reported that he was supposed to have made
his first appearance in the Emalahleni Magistrates Court earlier yesterday but
the case could not be heard due to an electricity outage. The court heard it was not safe for the suspect to walk
through the corridors in the dark and the matter was postponed to Friday. He was bust last Friday by the Hawks for allegedly acquiring
his South African citizenship fraudulently and also allegedly tried to
bribe the Hawks with an amount of R40 000 during his arrest.  Dubbed “Mr Sam Holdings”, he attracted attention with his 72-car
convoy to the Durban July. The publication said according to a source close to the
situation, the flamboyant businessman was rushed to hospital in what is
suspected to be a case of food poisoning. “Sam started complaining about stomach ache and an ambulance
had to be called to fetch him from the Witbank police holding cell. He was
rushed to the local private hospital where he spent a night receiving
treatment,” said the source to Sowetan. Another close friend of his said the businessman was still
receiving treatment at the hospital and was recovering.
