GOING to sleep not knowing where his brother is has been difficult for Ningi Madulini. He has been worried since his brother Siphelele Madulini (26) was kidnapped from his rented house. Ningi (24) from Clermont in Durban told Daily Sun Siphelele was sleeping alone in his house on 25 August after a night of boozing. A group of men allegedly arrived and took him. He said he was informed by Siphelele’s neighbours that the men drove a white van and were heavily armed. “The neighbours said they heard them break the door. They then got into the house, took Siphelele from his bed, threw him into their van and drove away,” he said. Ningi said he was called by neighbours.

Ningi said he was with Siphelele earlier on the previous night. “He didn’t tell me there was anyone looking for him. He was not a troublesome person. I’m confused as to why he was kidnapped,” he said. He said they had searched for him everywhere, but couldn’t find him.
