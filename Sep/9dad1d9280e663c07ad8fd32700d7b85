THE Springboks will carry the image of 1995 hero Chester Williams on their jerseys when they open their Rugby World Cup campaign against the All Blacks in Yokohama on Saturday at 11:45 SA time. Williams, who was a star of the victorious Springbok team that won the 1995 World Cup on home soil, passed away of a suspected heart attack earlier this month.According to the Springboks' official website, Williams' image has been embedded into the playing number on the team's jerseys. Current Springbok squad members' faces will also appear in the numbers, as well as those of fans who sent in selfies.Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus commented: "Chester didn't like being the centre of attention. He never bragged about his role or expected anything for it but he would have enjoyed being part of a Springbok/All Black Test match once more, I think."Williams represented both Western Province and the Golden Lions provincially and played for the Cats in the Super Rugby competition.He played 27 Tests for the Boks between 1993 and 2000, scoring 14 tries in that time and was named the SA Rugby Player of the Year in 1994.Following his retirement, Williams was active on the coaching circuit including stints with the Springbok Sevens team, the Cats and Pumas. -Sport24
