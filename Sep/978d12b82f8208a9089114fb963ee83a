THE Phalaphala FM Royal Heritage Festival aims to change the way Mzansi gets down and party. The organisers have set up a fitness gig this week ahead of the main spectacle. Organiser Shandu Nesengani said the fitness test would be staged at the Northern Farm in Jozi. He said the aim of the fitness test was to get concertgoers ready for the two-day festivities. This because it required a lot of stamina, as fans would be partying non-stop. Said Shandu: “The fun health and fitness event has been set up for fans to take part in various physical activities. “These activities will start early in the morning and continue till midday.” According to Shandu, the activities include hiking, walking, cycling, running and horse riding. “We’ve been inundated with calls to have the fitness test in Gauteng, as many people wanted to participate in the activities,” said Shandu. “Through this event we also want to encourage people to live a healthy lifestyle, while getting them ready for the event.” Shandu said the main event would take place at the Nandoni Dam on 13 and 14 September. “Wednesday will be for the Vhembe Royal Sports, hosted by Vhembe Tvet College. “This along with the Vhembe Royal Entrepreneurial workshop in Khoroni Hotel. “Thursday is the day for the Royal Comedy Show.” The Friday line-up includes Dr Tumi, Dr Rebecca Malope, Khaya Mthethwa, Takie Ndou, Rofhiwa Manyanga, Worship House and Lufuno Dagada, among others.
