The presenter who is known for helping people around Mzansi communities through social media was shocked to discover that the person she was helping with money was using it for drugs. Boity who hails all the way from Potchefstroom, North West, said she was left feeling helpless after finding this out. The 29-year-old star said she loves giving back and this makes her feel good but after this incident she has no words. The musician said she has been helping a young man in Alexandra, Joburg, for the past year and he called her yesterday to apologize. Boity said he told her that he has been using the money to buy drugs. She said he now wants her to take him to rehab. “I am so gutted and conflicted,” said the musician. Some of her followers encouraged her to hear him out while some were against it as he will use her to nurse his drug addiction. She said she will take him to rehab and he has to follow certain procedures.
