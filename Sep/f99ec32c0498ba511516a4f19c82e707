The trial of Nicholas Ninow, who is accused of raping a 7-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in Tshwane, is expected to kick off in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Monday. The 22-year-old was found fit to stand trial after being evaluated by a team of four experts, including psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist, in line with a 2018 court order. He spent a month at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital. His trial is expected to run from September 9 to 20. His legal team had submitted that the alleged rapist had a history of mental illness and had been using drugs since he was 14 years old. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2013. The court also heard that Ninow had attempted to commit suicide on several occasions due to depression caused by the disorder.
