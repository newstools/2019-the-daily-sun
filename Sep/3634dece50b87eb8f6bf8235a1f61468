SIYANDA Mankanku’s mum wants justice for his death. The 20-year-old from Shayamoya in Kokstad, southern KZN, succumbed to stab wounds in hospital on Tuesday. He and his friends Siviwe Mbatha (18) and Somi Miya (18) were allegedly attacked by Somi’s relative. Siviwe and Somi were allegedly in a relationship. Siyanda’s mum, Nontuthuzelo (47), said they heard the three were walking in the streets when Somi’s relative stumbled on them. “We were told the suspect asked who, between my son and Siviwe, was dating his relative. He then pulled out a knife and stabbed all of them,” said Nontuthuzelo. She said her son was seriously hurt when he tried o stop the suspect from stabbing his friends. “I’m sad my son was killed for nothing.” Siviwe’s brother Sonwabile Jumbo (19) said the suspect came to his home before allegedly stabbing the three. “He asked where Siviwe was. I told him to look for them at the home of one of their friends. He left and I decided to follow him as I was worried about why he was asking for Siviwe as they were not friends. “I was still on the road when I noticed he had found them and was attacking them,” said Sonwabile. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the incident. “A case of murder and two counts of assault were opened at Kokstad cop shop. “A suspect (19) was arrested. He’s expected to appear in court today,” said Mbele.
