Hey MizzB I’M 22 years old and have been dating this guy for seven years. He cheated on me several times and I forgave him. He made me quit school in grade 11 after our second child.  He claimed that my schoolmates were a bad influence. When I raised the issue of marriage, he said he couldn’t marry me because I wasn’t educated. He said he couldn’t build a future with a woman like me. I have nothing to live for.  Please help! ) Lady Hey Lady When you undervalue yourself, you give your partner and the world the power to devalue who you truly are.
