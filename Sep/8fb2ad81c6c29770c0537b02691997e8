GALLO Record Company has finally responded to allegations that it didn’t treat the late Idols runner-up Thami Shodebe well after no one from the label attended his funeral at the weekend. Thami died two weeks ago at Kalafong Hospital in Tshwane. According to his close friends, he suffered from depression as he was not getting gigs and therefore couldn’t take care of his family as he was the sole breadwinner.  ALSO READ:THAMI'S TOUGH LAST DAYS! Last week, Daily Sun reported that one of Thami’s friends, Themba Hamana, made shocking claims at his memorial service. He spoke about how Gallo allegedly refused to let him out of his contract and didn’t visit him in hospital but was the first to announce news of his death. The label has now released another statement to address these rumours. “It seems that sadly no matter what Gallo does to support Thami and his family, there are a group of individuals who will serve to ensure this unfounded attack on the record label carries on,” reads part of the statement. Gallo further claimed it elected not to attend the late singer’s funeral after last week’s “unexpected onslaught” at his memorial. “Predominantly, we did not want our presence at the funeral to spark any further unnecessary outbursts but preferred to respect the space of his family and his community in their time of mourning,” read the statement. Philly Kubheka, head of public relations and publicity for local entertainment channels for M-Net, said Mzansi Magic and the Idols SA team were in contact with the family to support them with the memorial service requirements in celebrating Thami’s life.
