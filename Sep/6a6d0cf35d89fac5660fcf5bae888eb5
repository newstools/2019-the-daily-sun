THE Legal Aid attorney acting on behalf of Nicholas Ninow in his rape trial will lay a charge of defamation against EFF Gauteng chairwoman, Mandisa Mashego. This after she allegedly accused him of being drunk in court on Thursday. The case against Ninow was postponed in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria yesterday, after the State and defence attorney Herman Alberts made their closing arguments. Alberts said as he was returning from the cells, he overheard a woman, identified as Mashego, saying he was drunk. “I deny it. I advised the lady I’m prepared to go for a sobriety test now if she wants to persist or publish that allegation,” Alberts told News24. He said he would sue Mashego for defamation of character and had already informed Legal Aid’s regional office of what had allegedly happened. – NEWS24
