Puff sleeves are all the range for summer 2019/20. This girly quirky trend is for any lady who doesn't mind being vintage and bold. Puff sleeves are seen on dresses and tops with a light weight fabric creating a puff. This trend dates back to the early 1900's, when women wore blouses with a puff sleeve edge.
