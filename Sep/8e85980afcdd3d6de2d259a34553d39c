MAMELODI Sundowns winger Anthony Laffor said he’s not the type of player who goes out on loan. The Liberian star has vowed to stay with the star-studded Brazilians and fight for his way back into the starting line-up. The 34-year-old, who is mostly used as an impact player by coach Pitso Mosimane, underwent surgery to repair a broken knee last season. Jeremy Brockie forced a loan move to join Maritzburg United, while George Lebese terminated his contract with the nine-times league champions. Stars such as Aubrey Ngoma, Oupa Manyisa, Emilliano Tade and Andile Jali, are struggling to break into the line-up. But Laffor has stressed that he was going nowhere. “I’m Anthony Laffor. I don’t entertain loans!” he exclaimed. “Why should I leave Sundowns? I’m not a reject. I don’t pay attention to loans. I prefer to stay and fight for my place. “It’s either the club releases me if they no longer want me. But going on loan is not an option. “When I left SuperSport to join Sundowns, people said I would stay for just one season and leave. But I’m now in my eighth year at Sundowns. I just need to work hard and remain humble.” Mosimane’s team is teeming with an abundance of talent. Laffor has won everything there is to win with the Tshwane giants and he insists he’s still hungry for more. The doctors have given him the thumbs up to return to the field. But he doesn’t want to rush his return as he wants to make sure he’s 100% fit. He said: “I’m not comfortable to play yet but the doctor says that I’m ready to start playing. Let’s give it a few weeks and take it from there. I want to come back with a bang to help the team to defend the league title.”
