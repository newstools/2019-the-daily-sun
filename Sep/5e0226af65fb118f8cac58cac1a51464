MAMELODI Sundowns winger Aubrey Ngoma has taken some time out of his schedule to share some words of advice with young aspiring footballers. Ngoma, who started his career at the University of Pretoria, knows just how difficult the road to becoming a professional player is and has decided to share a few tips with youngsters travelling down the same path. Speaking as guest at the ongoing COPA Coca-Cola Future Stars camp at the High Performance Centre in Pretoria, Ngoma stressed to the youngsters the importance of education, handling fame and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. At the weeklong camp, some of the best young footballers who played at the recently concluded National Finals in Durban will be given another opportunity to impress and hopefully be scouted by top development teams. “I was here to inspire the youngsters and give them a bit of perspective from a professional footballer so they know what is ahead of them. “Some of the important things that we discussed were about how to handle fame as they turn professional. And also, the type of lifestyle they need to sustain, looking after their bodies well. “I was very impressed when they showed keen interest on how to handle fame because it’s one of the things that players struggle with. They know that you need to remain humble even when your name is up in lights. The 30-year-old from Hammanskraal said the new generation of footballers need to prioritise education just as much as their football careers to avoid falling on hard times when they retire from playing. “It’s important to find the balance between football and education. At the end of the day, we can’t all make it in the same field,” insisted Ngoma.
