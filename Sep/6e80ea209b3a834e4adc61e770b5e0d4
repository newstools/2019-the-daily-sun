Two Soweto
Flying Squad cops were arrested for corruption and extortion. A victim
from Soweto was allegedly driving along Klip Valley Road over the weekend when
he was approached by two police officers who were driving a police vehicle. They reportedly
told him that the vehicle he was travelling in was stolen and demanded to take
it to a police pound. Police
spokesperson Captain Masondo said the cops then allegedly demanded an amount of
R10 000 and the victim arranged R5 000 of which the remaining amount would
be arranged at a later stage. The
following day, the officers called the victim demanding the balance. According
to Masondo, the victim then reported the matter to the SAPS Provincial
Anti-Corruption Unit, who immediately operationalised the information and put
together a sum of money to be handed over to the suspects. “The duo
was arrested during the hand-over and have subsequently been detained for
corruption and extortion,” Masondo said. Masondo advised
members of the public that the police would never ask for a payment in return
for an impounded or a stolen vehicle. The police
officers are expected to appear in the Protea Magistrate's Court in due course.
