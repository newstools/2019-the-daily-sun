INGA Mfono’s star continues to shine. The 17-year-old from Mthatha is in the running in two categories in the Eastern Cape Music Awards. He released his debut album, Inyaniso, in September last year.  He single-handedly composed, arranged and recorded all the songs in a makeshift studio inside a backroom flat in his home in Mandela Park in November 2017. He’s also a selftaught guitarist, drummer and marimba player. Inga started singing in church at the age of four. In June this year, he was signed by Joburg-based Wisdom Entertainment. He’s in the running for the Best Newcomer and Best Afro Pop awards. “I didn’t expect to be nominated. This is good for my profile,” said the matric pupil. School and music are equally important to him. He has applied for admission to universities around the country, and has been accepted at some. He urged young people who want to go into the entertainment industry to prioritise education.
