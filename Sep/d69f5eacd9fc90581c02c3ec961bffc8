NEW eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda yesterday issued a stern warning to business forums that disrupt construction in the city. Speaking at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, he said he won’t tolerate their demands that they be given a 30% stake in tenders. “I must make this clear as I begin to focus on my job as mayor,” said the mayor. “We’ve seen lot of work stoppages in the city by people who demand a 30% slice of tenders. “As much as we support small business, I won’t tolerate anarchists in this city.” He also announced new heads of departments, who he said would speed up service delivery. He named Councillor Ntokozo Sibiya as community services committee head, and deputy mayor Belinda Scott as head of security and emergency services. The infrastructure and human settlements committee, dealing with the allocation of RDPs, water, electricity supply, solid waste removal, transport and sanitation, would be headed by KZN ANC Youth League secretary Thanduxolo Sabelo. The portfolio was previously headed by Councillor Mondli Mthembu, who was recently charged with corruption along with former mayor Zandile Gumede over a R208 million solid waste tender. Sabelo said he was committed to fixing problems in his department, especially refuse collection. He said it was a shame a big city such as Durban had problems collecting rubbish. “I promise the people of eThekwini I’ll make sure no politicians get involved in influencing tenders through through the back door,” said Sabelo.
