KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp was not impressed by the behaviour of some of the club’s supporters during their match against Baroka on Saturday. Amakhosi regained top spot in the Absa Premiership standings following a narrow 1-0 win over Bakgaga at the FNB Stadium. But despite having secured all three points in the encounter, Middendorp was left disappointed when some fans booed his decision to substitute star midfielder Kearyn Baccus. Baccus, who has been a key figure for Amakhosi so far this season, was subbed off with ten minutes remaining in the second stanza, leaving a number of Chiefs fans rather displeased. After the match, Middendorp explained his reasons behind the decision to take the 28-year-old off and urged fans to have more trust in the technical team. “You guys know more than I know and you are all right,” Middendorp sarcastically remarked. “Twenty thousand are booing around, it’s unbelievable. In half time Baccus was already doubting if he can continue. We should have more trust in the communication between the players and the technical team. “It’s a bit of a disappointment but supporters are always right. But I also have responsibilities, I can’t let him risk further injury, we already have enough injuries.“Again, supporters are great, media is great, and everything is fine for me. I’ll have a nice glass of wine and be happy.”
