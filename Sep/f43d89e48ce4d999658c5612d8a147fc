When TV star Phumeza Mdabe's son Mpilo was diagnosed with eye cancer in 2014, she and her husband Shota didn't know how to deal with the situation. The celebrity couple were guests this morning on Mo Flava's show, The Morning Flava and shared how they dealt with their ordeal. "God has been our strength through our difficult time when we found out that our son had eye cancer. Our son is a fighter, who despite what he has been through continues to show emotional strength. He is stronger than both of us," Phumeza said ofÂ  their now 6-year-old son. She said initially they thought he would have squint eyes and because they didn't want him to be bullied at school, they sought help from doctors to help fix his eyes, but instead they got bad news that they didn't expect. "We were both very shocked, the news turned both our worlds upside down," Shota said. He said friends disappeared in their dark time, but they found strength in each other. "People, who would usually call me suddenly didn't, my phone that used to be busy was silent, that's when I realised that they saying that when days are dark friends are few is true," he said. Mpilo's ordeal has propelled the couple to establish the Impilo foundation, which will help children like Mpilo.
