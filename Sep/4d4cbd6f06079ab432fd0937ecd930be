Arsenal are reportedly looking to tie down star forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to a new contract extension beyond summer 2021. The 30-year-old Gabon international penned a three-and-a-half-year deal at the Emirates Stadium when he was signed by former boss Arsene Wenger in January 2018. Arsenal paid in the region of £56million to German Bundesliga outfit Borussia Dortmund for the signature of Aubamenyang. However, it could be argued that it has been money well spent given that he has scored 44 goals in 69 appearances in all competitions. Aubameyang shared the Premier League Golden Boot title with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, on 22 goals, while he is already on three goals this term. One of those efforts came in last Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham at the Emirates when he scored the equaliser in the 2-2 draw. Aubameyang is a huge part of boss Unai Emery’s plans as the Spanish tactician looks to deliver some success to the Gunners, while also securing a return to the Champions League. And with less than two years remaining on the contract he penned on arrival, reports have emerged claiming a new deal is now one of the club’s top priorities. Meanwhile, it has emerged that £72m record signing Nicolas Pepe’s return to Arsenal from international duty with the Ivory Coast is not injury-related. An update on the Ivorian Football Federation ahead of the friendly matches against Benin and Tunisia suggested that Pepe returned to Arsenal early because of an injury he was carrying on arrival. However, it now seems that the Gunners agreed for Pepe to spend the two-week break working on his fitness with them instead of playing for his country. An agreement was struck up between club and country when the former Lille man didn’t link up with the Gunners until late in the summer because of his involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations. https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/EnglishPremiership/gunners-eager-to-extend-aubameyangs-stay-20190907
