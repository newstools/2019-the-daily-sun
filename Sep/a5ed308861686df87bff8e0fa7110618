GLOBAL Citizen has hosted several celebrity guests at a gala dinner in Jozi onThursday. This as they launched their six-part docu-series, Activate: The Global Citizen Movement, in partnership with National Geographic and P&G. The show set to air on National Geographic (DStv channel 181), is about theGlobal Citizen movement to end extreme poverty by 2030. It features the likes of Hugh Jackman, Usher and our own Bonang “Queen B” Matheba. The fourth episode in the series will focus on Bonang and the work she’s done withGlobal Citizen in Mzansi to raise awareness around period poverty. Period poverty affects women and girls as far as access to sanitary products, safe, hygienic spaces in which to use them, and the right to manage menstruation without shame or stigma. On the red carpet at the event, Bonang spoke about the Always Keeping Girls in School campaign, in which sheparticipates. Said Bonang: “The gist of the programme is to educate young girls around puberty [and] menstruation. “What people don’t know is a lot of Mzansi girls miss school because they can’t afford something as simple as sanitary towels, or they’re not educated around menstruation and puberty. “There’s a lot of stigma around that.” The TV and radio personality said it was important for her to use her platform to help those in need. – Channel24
