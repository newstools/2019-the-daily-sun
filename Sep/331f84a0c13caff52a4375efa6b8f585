THE South African Football Association (SAFA) has sent a message of 'best wishes' to the Springboks for the 2019 Rugby World Cup currently under way in Japan. Springboks will kick-off their world Cup with a blockbuster against New Zealand on Saturday, 11:45 am. Acting SAFA CEO Russell Paul addressed the message to SA Rugby President Mark Alexander, Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus and national skipper Siya Kolisi. Paul wrote: On behalf of SAFA President Danny Jordaan, the SAFA NEC, the entire SAFA Membership and staff, Bafana Bafana, Banyana Banyana and all other SAFA national teams, I would like to extend our best wishes to all of you - including the players and technical support staff - as you commence the journey in the Rugby World Cup 2019. Your first World Cup title was won back in 1995, on the back of a euphoric time for our Rainbow Nation. Twelve years later in 2007, you won your second title, and 2019 heralds another 12 years later - and we see another title “loading” on the horizon. As a team, we know you will go out onto the field with pride, you will wear the badge with honour, and carry your hearts on your sleeves and above all, you will play with determination right to the end. We are all proud of you, and we will join the nation in carrying you on our shoulders, to lighten your burden on the pitch, and just know that every footballer will also be signing the national anthem in unison with you before each and every match. Walk tall our warriors, as you prepare to take on the world! Yours faithfully Russell Paul Acting Chief Executive Officer
