 ACCORDING to a report, EFF leader Julius Malema personally benefitted from the VBS heist.  The Daily Maverick reported that at least R5,3 million of the R16,1 million Floyd Shivambu’s brother Brian received from the bank went to Mahuna Investments, owned by Malema’s cousin Matsobane Phaleng. The publication analysed Mahuna’s bank statements and Malema’s movements and found it was likely that Malema used a bank card belonging to the company to buy things for himself. In July last year, Malema allegedly used the card to buy luxury clothing worth R27 094 at Sandton City in Joburg. In the same month, the account was used to pay R416 900 to Polokwane party venue Mekete Lodge. According to the report, the business was linked to Malema, EFF member Hebert Matlaila and at least relatives of Malema, including Phaleng. The investigation uncovered at least 35 internet payments over the course of 2017 and last year to Mekete Lodge, totally R2,07 million.  When asked about the venue, Phaleng said: “We run our hospitality business at Mekete and we also host public events and bring famous local and national artists and DJs to Mekete. We charge for entrance and sell food and beverages.” The report said Malema and EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi didn’t reply to questions sent over email last week.  The Daily Maverick’s detailed investigation traced and matched Malema’s movements around the country – from social media accounts and the EFF’s events diary – to the Mahuna Investments-linked bank card, which was used to make a number of point-of-sale payments. – Compiled by Denver Keytle/NEWS24
