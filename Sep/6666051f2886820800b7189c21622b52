ERNST Middendorp is not desperate to have Itumeleng Khune back in the Kaizer Chiefs starting lineup. Not for the first time this season, Khune watched from the bench, this time as Amakhosi sunk 1-0 to Polokwane City in their league encounter at FNB Stadium on Saturday. But it appears the captain will continue to twiddle his thumbs on the bench, seeing as the Amakhosi coach keeps faith with Daniel Akpeyi. "I'm not desperate to have him (Khune) back," said Middendorp. "He is back, he is influential within the team. There's a massive role he is playing as part of the captaincy." At the moment, there is a clear understanding of the assessment that we are going into. "We communicate with him every day. We will find the right moment to include him." We have qualified players who have taken over. At the moment we are not on a 100 percent level with him. "Khune last featured for the Glamour Boys in their league clash against Golden Arrows in December, before he was ruled out with a long shoulder injury lay-off. "You must understand when someone has been out for so long with an injury," Middendorp explained. "The shoulder is probably not the biggest problem. It's not broken bones. But it's normal procedure. Somebody has to recover fully after being injured for about four, five or six months. "He is fully into it at training. But you have to maintain and look into bringing him to a 100 percent level." Chiefs are still top of the log with 10 points, despite losing their first league match.They next visit AmaZulu on 24 September.
