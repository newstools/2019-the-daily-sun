TS Galaxy have been crowned 2019 Nedbank Ke Yona Challenge Champions. The Rockets edged the Nedbank Ke Yona Team 2-1 at Kameelrivier Stadium in KwaNdebele, Mpumalanga on Sunday. Samukelo Shangase and Sanele Barns were on target for the Rockets while Thulani Cele scored for the Ke Yona Team. Galaxy upset Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in last season’s Nedbank Cup final to earn a place in this year’s challenge. The 2019 Ke Yona Team on the other hand were also looking to create some history of their own by becoming the first Ke Yona side to bag the annual Nedbank Ke Yona Challenge trophy. As expected, the Rockets dominated possession in the game with the Ke Yona Team chasing shadows for the better part of the match. It did not take them long to make their dominance in the match count with Shangase netting the opener in the 9th minute. Two minutes later, Barns doubled the Rockets’ lead with the Ke Yona Team looking like they were going to be in for a long day. However, to their credit, they managed to contain the GladAfrica Championship outfit in the second half. And for all their efforts in trying to ensure they compete, the Ke Yona Team were duly rewarded when fullback Cele pounced on some poor defending from Galaxy to slot past Ludwe Mpakumpaku. They almost became the first Ke Yona Team to score more than one goal as they gave Galaxy a scare in the final stages of the match, however, it wasn’t to be with the game ending in the hosts favour. The Rockets will now turn their attention to the first-round of the Caf Confederation Cup where they will face CaPS Sport from Madagascar at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday.
