 New numbers
released by Statistics SA show a bloodbath in construction jobs over the past
months, while the mining sector is steadily employing more people - for now. The
Quarterly Employment Statistics survey for the second quarter of the year
showed that almost 10.2m people were employed in the second quarter, 2 000
fewer than in the first quarter of the year – but 141 000 more than a year ago. In the past
quarter to end-June alone, 16 000 jobs were lost in the construction sector –
there are now 30 000 fewer workers in the construction industry than a year
ago. But community services (including civil servants, health workers as well
as part-time workers for the elections this year) and the mining industry
reported increases of 44 000 and 3 000 jobs respectively over the past quarter. Parts of
the mining industry have benefited from stronger resource prices, particularly
platinum and gold. But job cuts are looming: Sibanye-Stillwater, the biggest SA
gold producer and the largest platinum miner in the world, may retrench almost
6 000 workers, while steel producer ArcelorMittal SA is also planning 2 000
retrenchments. Mining
employment The
manufacturing industry saw a sharp 15 000 drop in jobs in the past quarter
compared to the first quarter of the year. It employed 1 000 fewer people in
June 2019 compared to June 2018. Manufacturing

collects information on businesses registered for VAT with an annual turnover
greater than R300 000, as well as government employers. SOURCE:
