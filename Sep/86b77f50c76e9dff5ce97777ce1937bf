 The Isuzu bakkie nicknamed “Roadrunner” has been friends with Mzansi roads for the past 15 years. According to Gerhard du Toit from Oudtshoorn in the Western Cape, his bakkie KB bakkie has done more than 1,7 million kilometres. Speaking to CarMag, the 74-year-old madala said he’s been using the bakkie for his courier business. Gerhard says his brother bought the vehicle in 1997 as a secondhand car with 7 000 km on the clock. “You have to understand that I treat my bakkie very well and talk to my bakkie every day. I ask the bakkie to drive nicely and tell the bakkie that I rely on it, to get me where I need to be,” said Du Toit. Du Toit uses the vehicle to travel between Oudtshoorn and George twice a day. He told the publication that he stops and starts the bakkie between 80 to 100 times per day. “This is as I drop off the parcels or pick up parcels at my various clients in the two towns. I have had to replace my front seat covers twice already, but I think Roadrunner may still outlive me one day,” he said. According to Du Toit he has never missed a service. He previously told Wheels24 when his bakkie was still at 1.5 million kilometers that despite the dry, harsh conditions of the Karoo, the key to the longevity of his bakkie is to make sure that it is fully serviced every 10 000km and to maintain it with genuine parts. Du Toit said: "I might not be able to take on the Dakar Rally but when I get into my Isuzu I have complete faith that it will take me where I need to be and back without any problems." He says whenever he takes the KB bakkie for service, there is never any major problems when he takes the bakkie for its service.
