CRAZY Entertainers are planning a massive comeback. The comedians, known for their skit videos, last released a DVD called Crazy Entertainers Reloaded in 2012. The group was made up of Thato “Ntate Modiri” Maphanga, Phillip “Pastor A” Hlatshwayo and Patrick “Senzeni” Khoba. They rose to fame in 2003. Ntate Modiri told Daily Sun: “We managed to make enough money to survive but we started suffering as we had to spend a lot of cash on production.” He said piracy had also hit their profits, but this time they were planning to release material on YouTube and working on doing live shows. “We didn’t do well with our last DVDs as people made copies,” he said.  Ntate Modiri said he hoped the movie would be a boost for their brand. “We want to show people we didn’t forget about them,” he said. Senzeni said he was performing solo in Burgersfort, Limpopo, and working on a movie. But the funny man said he would return to the group in the coming months.  “We’re still a team and we are just busy with our own shows,” he said. “We’ve been working on building our individual brands as comedians because this is what we know best.” Senzeni said he was happy he’d be working with the group again. “We want to bring back the crazy shows people love. We’re here to give the masses what they want,” said Senzeni. He said they were also passionate about helping young talent in Limpopo.
