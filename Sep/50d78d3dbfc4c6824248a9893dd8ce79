RESIDENTS were woken up by the shocking news of gogo’s murder. They couldn’t believe she was allegedly killed by a relative, who accused her of being evil. It was reported that gogo (95) from Matenteng Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, was hacked to death with a shovel on Monday. That was after the gogo and her relative (39) got into an argument. Neighbours were shocked that the relative didn’t run away after the incident, but waited for cops. One of the neighbours said they didn’t understand why the relative killed gogo in such a brutal manner as they had lived together for a long time.  According to cops, the gogo’s son told them he was in his home, which is not far from gogo’s house, when he heard people shouting. He told cops he rushed there and was shocked to find his mum lying in a pool of blood outside the house. She had a terrible cut on her head, and there was a shovel next to her.  Police spokeswoman Constable Marilyne Mmonwa said the relative didn’t run away from the scene, but was found sitting on a chair in the house. Mmonwa said the 39-year-old suspect handed himself over to cops. “Police recovered the shovel used in the killing and the body was taken to the government mortuary,” said Mmonwa. Mmonwa said the suspect was charged with murder and will appear in the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court soon.
