A MEMBER of the Limpopo provincial legislature is in trouble after she was caught on video using the “K” word. Marcelle Maritz, the only representative of the Freedom Front Plus in the legislature, referred to the APK Church as a “church without ka***s”. The DA in Limpopo said would lay criminal charges against her today, while the ANC wants the legislature’s ethics committee to investigate. The EFF wants her removed from the legislature. Maritz is heard in the video singing “I believe I can fly,” and saying she wants to be “free of k****s” Beyers Smit, the DA’s National Council of Provinces member, said the party found Maritz’s utterances abhorrent an unacceptable. “We will not tolerate this behaviour,” he said. “We believe there is no place for racists in our society.” ANC chief whip Jerry Maseko said the video clip revealed the true character of Maritz. “Her stance has confirmed our long-held suspicion that the Freedom Front Plus’s electoral base largely comprises a racist white minority. They cannot stomach being led by a black person.” The EFF’s Jossey Buthane said Maritz was trying to reverse the gains of democracy. “We are calling upon the Freedom Front Plus to release her from her duties and the Human Rights Commission to investigate her conducts,” he said. “She was once accused of whipping a man in Mokopane after he was allegedly using a whip on his donkeys,” he said. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo advised the DA to approach the Human Rights Commission. Freedom Front Plus national spokesman Wouter Wessers said the party viewed the allegations in a very serious light. “In the past we acted against those who were found to be racists and if she is admitting to have said those racism words we will act as well,” Wessels said. “It is, however, difficult when the case is before court. But we are investigating those allegations.”
