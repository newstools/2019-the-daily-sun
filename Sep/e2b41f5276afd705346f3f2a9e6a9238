TWO men who pretended to be Eskom workers told the magistrate they needed medical attention for their injuries after they were hurt while running away from the cops. Mokete Mulutsi (38) and Motlogelwa Merai (25) appeared in the Itsoseng Magistrates Court near Lichtenburg yesterday. Theyâ€™re facing a charge of theft under false pretences. They were bust last Thursday when the car they were travelling in rolled over while they were fleeing from the cops. The men are originally from the Free State. They allegedly walked around several villages in Itsoseng asking for bribes from residents who bridged electricity. A villager who suspected something was wrong called the real Eskom official to the scene. After realising they were caught, they fled and ended up crashing their car. The case was postponed to next Wednesday for their legal representative to verify their addresses and to organise medical attention for them.
