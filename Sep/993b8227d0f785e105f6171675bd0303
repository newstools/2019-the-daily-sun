TAXI owners and drivers belonging to the Refilwe Cullinan Taxi Association marched to the Cullinan cop shop in Tshwane on Wednesday. Taxi rank chairman Vusi Matlala (38) said they were disappointed because cops wouldn’t listen to their grievances. He said taxi owners and drivers were angered that sedans, known as amaphela, operated on their route and stole customers. “Enough is enough. These small taxis are taking bread out of our mouths and no one is ready to stop them. “The local station commander has avoided addressing us on several occasions. This is not good. We’re losing business.” Matlala said most of the smaller taxis operated without permits. “We suspect some cops own these taxis, seeing they’re not doing anything against them,” said Matlala. “We were disappointed when the station commander didn’t come to address us.” Taxi owner Stanley Aphane said he wanted the sedans to be removed from the routes. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said cops don’t issue taxi permits. He said the taximen should contact the transport department. “The police enforce the law. They don’t control who uses which road,” said Makhubele.
