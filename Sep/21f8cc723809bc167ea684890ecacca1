THE City of Joburg recently unveiled its new emergency services fleet. Mayor Herman Mashaba was joined by public safety MMC and acting group corporate and shared services MMC Leah Knott. They inspected the first batch of fire and rescue vehicles, numbering 10 in total. Five more were expected by the end of the week. Said Mashaba: “These vehicles are a critical resource within emergency services since firefighters are able to use them for first response. “Rapid intervention vehicles often arrive first on the scene, where firefighters assess the situation and call for appropriate firefighting resources. “These vehicles carry rescue equipment that emergency services use in responding to motor vehicle accidents.” Mashaba said emergency services received 42 new ambulances in June.
