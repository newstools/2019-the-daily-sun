 BUSINESSES in Mzansi have taken a strain due to the recent
violent attacks.  This was revealed during a stakeholder summit hosted by the
South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SACCI).  Yesterday, Police Minister Bheki Cele met with stakeholders
whose businesses were affected by the attacks.  Cele was accompanied by executives from MTN, Vodacom and
MultiChoice.  He said the police made a breakthrough on how to deal with
the perpetrators.  “We are working tirelessly to ensure we restore peace and
order in the affected areas,” he said.  Cele said more than 639 people were arrested.  “The total number of dead people linked to the xenophobic
attacks is 12. Two are foreign nationals and the rest are South Africans,” he
said.  He said the number may be reviewed later as investigations
continue.  Cele further clarified the state visit by Nigerian President
Muhammadu Buhari had nothing to do with the ongoing violence.  “I want to correct the narrative that is on some TV channels
to say the president of Nigeria is coming here because there’s a problem of
xenophobia,” he said.  “So that he is coming here because of the problems in the
country that is a wrong narrative. Whoever pushes that must stop it.”  MTN CEO Rob Shuter said the unrest affected their
stakeholder operations with other countries.  “We are concerned with the long-term negative investor
sentiment that this violence is causing for South Africa,” he said.  Shuter said four MTN outlets were attacked in Nigeria,
forcing them to close their retail stores.  Meanwhile, Multichoice CEO, Calvin Mawela said the company
had to close down its offices in Nigeria for four days last week, affecting the
company’s ability to connect customers.
