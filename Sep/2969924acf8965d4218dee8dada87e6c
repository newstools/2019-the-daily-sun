A 60-year-old madala died in a sex shop. The madala from Britain was reportedly watching porn at a sex shop in Italy when he died. He reportedly suffered a heart attack in a private booth in Marghera near Venice on Friday afternoon. The mkhulu had allegedly paid five euros which is about R85 for a 15-minute video. According to the DailyMail the owner of the shop got worried when the madala did not reappear. When the shop owner went in, he found him collapsed on the floor. The shop owner said the mkhulu appeared 'quiet' and perhaps 'tired' when he arrived. Following that the owner called emergency services and when doctors arrived they tried to resuscitate the man but it was too late.
