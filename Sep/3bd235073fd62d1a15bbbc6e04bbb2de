TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula has highlighted problems posed by illegal migrants. He was speaking at the Langlaagte Licensing and Testing Department in Joburg on Friday. Said Mbalula: “My department is working with other departments to intensify operations controlling access to the borders to prevent illegal trucks from entering the country.” He said incompetence and indecision had made society feel helpless. As a result, people had decided to take the law into their own hands. Mbalula slammed the recent attacks on foreigners. He said government was in discussions with the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and other lobby bodies, business, as well as trade unions regarding scrapping e-tolls. He vowed to clamp down on misconduct at licensing and testing centres after concerns over corruption were raised. He said he was working with the Road Traffic Management Corporation, the Hawks and other law-enforcement agencies to catch crooked officials.
