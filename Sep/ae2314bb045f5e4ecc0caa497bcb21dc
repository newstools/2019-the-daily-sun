A DISTRAUGHT witness told the court how her colleagues were brutally attacked at Ngcobo Police Station on 21 February last year. Data typist Vuyelwa Memani was on night duty on the day of the incident when five cops were killed. She took the stand in the Mthatha High Court yesterday. She testified in the trial of five accused – Andani Monco, Kwanele Ndlwana, Siphosethu Tshefu, Siphosomzi Tatsi and Phumzile Mhlatywa. She said she got to the charge office at 11.12pm from her office, in the same building. She was with the late cops Warrant Officer Zuko Mbini and Constables Zuko Ntsheku, Nkosiphendule Pongco, Sibongiseni Sandlana and Kuhle Mateta. “I had my back to the visitor’s entrance. Mbini said ‘there they are, they have arrived’,” said Memani. She said this was something they normally joked about and she thought officer Mbini was joking. “I turned to look at the door. I saw people wearing face masks pointing at us with firearms.” Memani said there were about eight men standing at the entrance. “One pointed directly at me with an R5 rifle. I heard a gunshot. The door opened and shots were fired countless times. I hid under the counter,” said Memani. She said she saw Mbini fall and the gunshots stopped afterwards. “I heard footsteps on top of the counter. Two people jumped in front of me and shouted ‘voetsek, get out you’,” she said. Memani said the man demanded she show them the safe where the firearms were kept. The trial continues.
