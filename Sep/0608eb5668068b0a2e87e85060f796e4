Reckless driving continues to be a problem in Gauteng. This afternoon, 13 people were injured in an accident that happened at Parkview in Jan Smuts Ave and Westcliff Dr involving two vehicles. The JMPD spokesman, superintendent, Wayne Minnaar said a minibus taxi driver has been arrested for Reckless and Negligent Driving, Driving an unroadworthy and unlicensed motor vehicle.  “We keep having these accidents and September and August has been two of the worst months of us dealing with accidents. People still don’t obey the law but we’ll continue doing our job till motorist understand that we will work till we decrease these injuries and fatalities,” said Minnaar. “Those who have witnessed bad driving can send all images and videos to 081 410 6338, operation Buya Mthetho’s WhatsApp hotline. Few people take road traffic laws nearly as seriously as they should and one of the biggest problems with this is that many have come to accept traffic fines as a “fact of life” or regard them as bending of the rules instead of as the commission of a crime, This will end,” Minnaar added
