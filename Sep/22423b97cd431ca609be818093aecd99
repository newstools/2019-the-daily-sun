WELL-KNOWN Limpopo comedian and actor Tambudzeni, “Mr Bundu” Rasendedza, could find himself behind bars. Bundu, who played the lead in the films Tshovhilingana and Bundutshikondoni, allegedly assaulted his wife Tshifhiwa Nedididi with burning plastic and burnt her all over her body. He allegedly attacked her two weeks ago but it was kept a secret, with only his close family members knowing about it. The badly injured Tshifhiwa was not even taken to hospital. She was taken home by her parents after the incident. Yesterday, she was taken to Tshiludzini Hospital’s trauma centre by Thohoyandou cops after her parents wanted to open a case. Tshifhiwa (25) said she endured a lot of pain as a result of being beaten during their three years of marriage. “I kept it between us as he threatened to kill and bury me in the house if I tell people or report him. I decided to speak out because I wanted people to know what I am going through.” She said she did it to encourage women going through abuse to speak out. “If it were not for my mother. I would have died in the house without people knowing.” Bundu denied the claims. He said they were aimed at destroying his name and career. He denied ever beating her. “We have differences as a couple, but what she’s telling are pure lies. She wanted us to sign in community of property. I refused. She said she’d punish me.” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Tshifhiwa has been taken to the hospital for medical attention. “I can’t confirm what case the police will be opening against the suspect because we haven’t registered it yet or spoken to the victim as she’s still being seen by the doctor.”
