THEMBINKOSI Lorch’s quite personality belies his talent on the pitch. Getting a word out of him is like pulling teeth. But as ever, the twinkle-toed midfielder is ready to do the talking on the field and help deliver the trophies for the success-starved Orlando Pirates. Lorch admits he has set himself a tougher act to follow as the reigning PSL Footballer of the Season. “Pressure is the name of the game. If you don’t have pressure you tend to relax and that means one would not replicate the past form,” said Lorch. “I know a lot is expected of me. We came close in the league last season. This season we are going for the Premiership title. We also have the Telkom Knockout and the Nedbank Cup to compete for. So, it’s a matter of focusing and achieving our goals.” Lorch, however, has been wary not to place too much responsibility on his tiny shoulders. He hasn’t scored in three matches and hasn’t provided any assist, watching as the Buccaneers stuttered out the starting blocks this season. “I have had some coaches telling me that I need to score more goals and things like that, but I feel I have done my part,” he said. “I don’t have to prove (anything) to anyone. I just have to play my football and help the team to win games. “It’s not about me only, but about the team. We have quality players. We have to work as a team and produce results for the team.” Like his teammates, Lorch has been working to adjust to the new tactical strategy, following the recent departure of erstwhile coach, Milutin Sredojevic. “We were disappointed because he is a coach who we got along with and had been working with for the past two seasons,” Lorch opened up. “But we have to move on. I believe the past two weeks have been good for us as a team to work on a few things. Yes, there are slight changes but we have adapted. “We built the foundation last season. This time we have to produce results and win trophies.”
