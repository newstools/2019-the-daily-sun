According to Stats SA, 1,287 births were registered to girls between the ages of 10 and 14 last year. In the 14 months between January 2018 and February 2019, the agency said, 1,287 births were recorded to mothers between the ages of 10 and 14, based on data drawn from the department of home affairs' National Population Register (NPR). The ages of fathers can not be tracked with great reliability, because their details remain missing on most birth registrations. In 2018 details of fathers were missing in 62.7% of births, StatsSA said. The mean age for mothers dropped to a low of 26.2 years in 2006, and only breached 27 years again in 2016. It has been climbing steadily ever since, by 1.1% between 2016 and 2017, and by 1.5% between 2017 and 2018.
