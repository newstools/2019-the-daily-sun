THE thugs’ plan backfired when they tried to hijack an Uber driver and rob him of his cellphone on Friday. The driver allegedly responded to a request from a client going from Mount Edgecombe to Avoca Hills in Durban. But there was no client. Instead, he was approached by two armed suspects who allegedly stole his cellphone and hijacked his car. The driver was left stranded, but he managed to get help and call the cops.  Later that day, the tracking company traced the stolen car to Dumisani Makhaye Drive near the Siyanda area. The suspects were apparently still using it. Cops were then called and they acted quickly. The car was spotted in K section in KwaMashu, where a chase ensued. Cops eventually managed to stop the car, but two suspects escaped, while one was bust. UBER AND BOLT DRIVERS IN DANGER The arrested suspect is expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon. During the arrest, cops recovered two stolen cellphones and a gas pistol. Another Uber driver (38) said such incidents were terrifying. He said they didn’t feel safe anymore and it was going to be hard to trust anyone when they got requests. “I’m glad cops managed to arrest one of the suspects. He should be denied bail and get a harsh sentence. The court should make an example of him,” he said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of carjacking was opened at Phoenix Police Station and the suspect was expected to appear in Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon.
