POLICE are investigating circumstances that led a 14-year-old girl to take her own life hours after her school uniform was stained with menstrual blood. Her mum said she was humiliated by a teacher at Kabiangek Primary School on Friday for soiling her uniform. “She had nothing to use as a pad. When the blood stained her clothes, she was told to leave the classroom and stand outside,” the mum told the Standard newspaper. The mum protested outside the school, 270km west of the capital Nairobi, with about 200 other parents on Tuesday. They demanded the arrest of the teacher. According to the Daily Nation, police used tear gas to disperse the protesters. Twitter users shared a video of the protest. Rift Valley police chief Alex Shikondi said investigations were ongoing. He urged parents to forge a close relationship with their children. A law passed in June 2017 compels the government to provide free sanitary towels to all girls who need them at primary school level. – BBC
