VIRGINITY testers say the practice is still relevant even
in this day and age. They were speaking during the reed dance celebration
in Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, north of KZN today. Virginity tester, Khululiwe Nzuza (47) from Mandeni,
north of KZN said the practice is advantageous in many ways. "It protests them again diseases. It also
protects them from falling pregnant while they are still young. Falling
pregnant at a young age cripples their future," said Nzuza. She said there are other several important things
that are being taught in the virginity testing classes. Making examples, she said maidens are taught
respect, priding themselves in being African women and how they should carry
themselves all the way to women hood. She said she has been testing maidens for the past
15 years. She said they are not forcing anyone to come for
virginity testing. "They come voluntarily. All we do is encourage
them not to look back once they have started until they get married," said
Nzuza. She said there are challenges they come across like
being bashed by people who believe that the practice is abusive or no longer
relevant. "We also have a problem of our maidens who fall
along the way by falling pregnant or engaging in sexual activity and their
action will see them being kicked out of the practice because it encourages
abstanance," said Nzuza.
