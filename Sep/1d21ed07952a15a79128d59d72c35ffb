SAM “Mshengu” Chabalala was expected to apply for bail today. The 23-year-old Mpumalanga businessman was arrested in Emalahleni last Friday by the Hawks on charges of fraud, corruption, going against the immigration act and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. He allegedly used the address of a scrapyard in Bethal to get a fraudulent ID. Chabalala made headlines two months ago when he led a convoy of 72 cars to the Durban July. The trucker millionaire claimed he was born in Venda, Limpopo, but when Home Affairs questioned him, he changed his story and said he was born at Bethal Hospital. However, the hospital had no record of his birth. Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said Chabalala’s nationality was being investigated. Mshengu was supposed to appear in court on Monday but there was no electricity at the Witbank Magistrates Court and the case was postponed. He was admitted to hospital this week after apparently getting food poisoning.
