THEY were on their way to a church service but never got there. Four people died at the scene when they were run over by a speeding Nissan Micra on Tuesday evening. Two of the dead, siblings Corny (41) and Pontsho Kadiaka (30), had broken legs while the bodies of neighbours Veronica Mphahlele (55) and Koketso Ntswane were found some distance away. They were certified dead on the scene by emergency services. It’s alleged the speeding motorist was coming from his girlfriend’s house when he lost control and crashed into the group of church people. He fled on foot when residents arrived at the scene in Maralaneng Village, Ga-Mphahlele, in Limpopo. Lethabo Mphahlele (31) said they got a call at about 7pm, telling them there had been an accident and her mum was involved. “When I went there I saw they were all gone,” said Lethabo. “My mother was a pillar in our family. Moving forward is going to be difficult for us.” Mahlatse Kadiaka (33) said the sudden death of both his sisters was difficult to accept. “They loved the church. It’s sad that they couldn’t even make it to church,” he said. “Both my sisters have young children. How are we going to tell them they won’t see them again?” Gogo Segopotse Ntswane (63) said having Koketso around was wonderful. “She always interpreted the news for me.” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that cops were investigating cases of culpable homicide.
