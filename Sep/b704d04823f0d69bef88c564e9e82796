CAPE Town City coach Benni McCarthy feels that he has been too nice on his players recently and that has led to them taking the foot off the pedal in their games. McCarthy is considering going back to his hairdryer treatment, ala former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, to ensure his players improve their performance. The hairdryer treatment was introduced by Ferguson, who used to deliver verbal volleys at his players in an effort to get the better out of them. City were a shadow of their former self against Kaizer Chiefs at Newlands Stadium last week, and ended up going down 2-1 on the day. Previously, the former Bafana Bafana striker used to let his feeling known to his players by shouting and even swearing at them. But of late he has toned it down, something he now rues. “Maybe I must go back and watch last season’s videos of me at half time. Now I’ve taken a more calmer approach to coaching because I’m going to get a heart attack if I continue at this rate,” said McCarthy. “I have allowed the players to be free, not to be on their case all the time. “But with footballers, you need to be on their case all the time because it is such a shame.” In the first half, City were on top of Amakhosi. They deservedly took the lead through Kermit Erasmus. But they lost an encounter to succumb to their first league loss of the season. With an international break in full swing in the next two weeks, McCarthy is set to blow the heads of the players to remain focused in the 90 minutes of their games. McCarthy is currently out of the country, in Scotland, to see his recently born baby boy – his fifth child and second to his second wife. His side will have 17 days of rest before their next PSL game against SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium on 14 September. He will expect a better performance compared to the one against Chiefs.
