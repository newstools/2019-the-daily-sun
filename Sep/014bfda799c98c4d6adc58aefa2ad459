People including politicians, church and traditional leaders came in their numbers to bid her farewell. University of Cape Town vice-chancellor Professor Mamokgethi Phakeng said hearing about Uyinene’s disappearance was hard. “But it was more painful to hear she was no more, and had died at the hands of a stranger. Throughout the week, we gathered to mourn and honour the beautiful promising young life cut short. It’s very difficult to lose a child in this way. “Just five weeks ago we launched the ‘I am’ campaign, asking people to know what it means to be a woman,” Phakeng said. Deputy Higher Education Minister Buti Manamela said he wished to have been a speaker at Uyinene’s graduation. MUM OF UYINENE'S 'KILLER' NOT WELL! “This week we’ve seen an unprecedented outpouring of national grief for the death of Uyinene and justified anger at the man who killed her. It’s understandable as she was a brilliant young person in the prime of her life, with her whole future ahead of her.” Police Minister Bheki Cele said he’d create a special team to focus on violence and student cases. He told cops to stop asking women what they wore during incidents. “You’re not fashion designers,” he said. The university has set up the Uyinene Mrwetyana Scholarship for women in humanities in her honour.
