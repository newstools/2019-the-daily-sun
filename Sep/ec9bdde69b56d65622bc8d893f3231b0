ALL she ever wanted was a bright future for her three children. But the mum now has two graves to fill. Her three kids ate biscuits last Sunday that were allegedly laced with poison. Two died and one is in hospital. Speaking to Daily Sun at the family home in Bophelong outside Vanderbijlpark, south of Joburg, Matshidiso Mosikidi (29) said she had planned an outing for her kids and her mum. “Moments before we prepared to leave, I gave the kids money to buy snacks. They came back asking for more,” said Matshidiso. She said when the kids went to buy more snacks, they were allegedly given biscuits smeared with powder by an unknown man. She said the kids started acting strangely when they eventually got to town. “Paballo had bubbles coming out of her mouth and she vomited blood. We rushed her to hospital. But she died when we arrived.” She said she called her mum, who was in town with the other kids, but a stranger picked up her phone. “They told me to come back. When I got back I found my mother crying, and when I looked at Karabo he was lying on the floor, dead.” Days later a plastic, filled with what the family suspect was poison, was found on top of a shack in the yard. “I don’t know who poisoned my children. All I want is for them to be arrested,” said Matshidiso. Vanderbijlpark police spokeswoman Sergeant Gertrude Makhale said an inquest docket was opened for investigation. The police received post- mortem results, which indicated both kids died from poisoning. “The kids’ stomach contents were taken to the lab for toxicology testing to find out what type of poison it was and from which food it came from,” she said. The funeral would be held in Bophelong on Saturday.
