A Western Cape teen has been sentenced to a hefty 12 years
in prison for stealing almost 2km of copper cable in Robertson, police said on
Sunday.  Spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the 18-year-old
had made off with 1 800m of copper cable belonging to Eskom last year.  It's removal had caused electricity interruptions in the
area.  Rwexana said Rethabile Mxolisi was sentenced to 12 years in
prison by the Robertson Magistrate's Court a week ago, in terms of the Criminal
Amendment Act, for tampering with, damage to, and theft of essential
infrastructure.  Acting Western Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General
Sindile Mfazi said he considered the conviction and sentencing a deterrent to
would-be cable thieves.  "Tampering, damage and theft of copper cable is a
serious offence that impacts on essential services such as rail, telephone and
electricity services. The economy of the country also suffers as a result of
these offences," Mfazi was quoted as saying. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/western-cape-teen-gets-12-years-for-stealing-2km-of-copper-cable-20190915
