DEPUTY President David Mabuza visited the Vaal yesterday to assess progress at the Sedibeng Regional Sanitation Scheme project. But he was immediately greeted by angry residents, who demanded jobs. The residents said they were gatvol because government had not kept its promise to give them jobs. Dieketseng Motaung (24) said they had been lied to on so many occasions. “Water and Sanitation Minister Gugile Nkwinti promised people jobs but we still have not seen anything. We’ve been protesting outside these premises since last week, demanding jobs,” she said. Mabuza urged residents not to interrupt the project. “We’re working on your grievances. We’ll be back in the next two weeks to give feedback on your demands,” he said. “I was told 2 000 people will be trained and employed. “There’s plenty of work that needs to be done here and we will do that work with you. “Don’t protest here and stop the work being done.” The visit followed the appointment last year of the defence force by President Cyril Ramaphosa to help stop the pollution of the Vaal River system. The project is a multibillion-rand and multi-year initiative to upgrade waste water treatment plants in Sebokeng, Leeuwkuil and Rietspruit. During the visit, Mabuza and his entourage were shown around and briefed on the project’s progress.
