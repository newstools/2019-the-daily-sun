THE situation is tense at Durban University of Technology after a security guard (27) was allegedly assaulted by students. They allegedly poured petrol over him and tried to set him alight. The guard sustained severe injuries and was taken to hospital after being rescued by his colleagues. EFF Student Command chairman Jimmy Nkambule said they started raising concerns after an attack on a student on 9 September at the Steve Biko campus. “Students raised their concerns again that their safety was at risk in the presence of Excellence Security guards,” he said. “They stressed there was no need for guards to be kept if they were attacked while they were on duty.”  Nkambule said lectures were suspended on Friday and were expected to resume yesterday if a solution was found. “The institution announced the programme would start, while no solution was reached. That’s when students got angry,” said Nkambule. Captain Nqobile Gwala said nine students were bust for the attack.  “They will be charged with attempted murder, malicious damage to property and public violence, and they will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon,” Gwala told Daily Sun. “The situation is under control. Berea police, as well as public order police, are at the scene to monitor the situation.”  Spokesman Alan Khan said: “Officials are assessing the damage. The university advises the SRC and protesting students to act within the law and respect the rights of students and staff who want to keep campuses and residences operational.”
