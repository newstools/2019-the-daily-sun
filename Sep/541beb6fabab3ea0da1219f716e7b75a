HIGHLANDS Park are a team on a mission this season. They continued their impressive start to their campaign after a 2-0 win over Polokwane City at their Makhulong Stadium fortress yesterday. Mothobi Mvala and Peter Shalulile were on target to earn Highlands their third Absa Premiership win of the campaign. Since the beginning of the season, Owen Da Gama’s outfit have tasted defeat just once – that was a 3-2 loss to Kaizer Chiefs on the opening day. Since then, the Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba have gone on a five match unbeaten run in the league – eight in all competitions. They also have the MTN8 final against SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (6pm) to look forward to. Ironically, they defeated Rise and Shine in the semi-finals. The Limpopo side were out for revenge when the two sides, who must be sick of the sight of each other, resumed their battle – this time with three points up for grabs. It was Highlands who found their rhythm first in the first half, giving George Chigova a lot of work to do in the Polokwane goal. Their early dominance paid off when Mothobi Mvala opened the scoring in the 22nd minute. The powerful midfielder ghosted into the penalty area to stab home from close range to register his first goal of the season. The second half was a much tighter and more even affair with both sides trading blows, however, it was Highlands who landed the killer blow through Shalulile on the counter. This meant the three points remained in Tembisa with Highlands turning their attention to their first ever cup final in the PSL era at the weekend.
