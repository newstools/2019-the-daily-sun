DESPITE lack of firepower upfront in their opening four games of the Absa Premiership season, Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker is not losing any sleep. The Premiership rookies were given a rude awakening in top flight football as they scored one goal in four league matches, collecting just two points. The Western Cape-based outfit have been tipped as early season relegation candidates. They are second from bottom, with two points. The Fifa international break gave Barker time to work on his team’s goal-scoring abilities. They played to goalless draws against Chippa United and Maritzburg United and lost the local derby 1-0 to Cape Town City and suffered a 2-1 defeat against Bidvest Wits. Their only goal in the PSL came from an own goal by Bafana Bafana and Wits skipper Thulani Hlatshwayo. Barker is happy with the likes of Morgan Gould, a vastly experienced defender, who represented Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United in the big league. Barker had stints at AmaTuks, and AmaZulu in the Premiership and he is hoping to use the break away from football to fine tune his new comers. Barker said: “So far, we’ve been given a two-and-a-half week break and that has given us enough time to regroup so that we can comeback stronger. But there is progress in the team. We have competitive in the league. We pushed Cape Town City and Wits, two competitive teams in the league.” He believes the only thing missing at the newly promoted outfit is winning games. “We must improve our attack. We’re giving the ball away too much. We lack experience upfront.” “The players must grow up quickly and our front players must grow up quickly.” Barker’s charges visit Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium next Sunday afternoon (3pm). The coach is counting on Ryan Moon from Chiefs did not have pre-season with the Cape based side, but the coach is counting on him to bang in the goals upfront. “There’s lots to work on. We’ll work with Moon to get him sharp upfront,” he said.
