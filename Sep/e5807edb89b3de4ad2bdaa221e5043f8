KHAMA Billiat heroics saved his national team Zimbabwe from being eliminated in the World Cup qualifiers. Billiat scored two minutes into stoppage to hand Zimbabwe a 3-1 win over minnows Somalia, whose solitary-goal first leg win proved insufficient to survive. A dramatic finish to the return match saw Marshall Munetsi give Zimbabwe a second leg lead 13 minutes from time only for Omar Abdullah Mohamed to equalise. Zimbabwe had to score at least twice to avoid a shock exit and Knox Mutizwa, direct from a free kick, and Billiat with a hard close-range shot netted for a dramatic victory. Now Zimbabweans around the world will wait to see who they will be pitted against in the group stages of qualification as they continue their quest to reach a WC finals for the first time ever.
