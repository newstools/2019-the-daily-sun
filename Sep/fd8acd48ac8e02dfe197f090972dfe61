ACTING Orlando Pirates coach, Rhulani Mokwena, has showered Tshegofatso Mabasa with praise after he led the Soweto giants to an important 2-1 win against Chippa United at Orlando Stadium on Saturday. The former Bloemfontein Celtic striker broke the ice 10 minutes into the second half before completing his brace in the 61st minute of this interesting duel, which was Mokwena’s first win since he was left to hold the fort after the shock resignation of Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic. These were, ironically, Mabasa’s first goals since he joined the club from Celtic during pre-season and ended Pirates’ run of six matches without a win. “Apart from the goals that he scored, we asked him to do a lot of work to assist us with pressing and he was outstanding with that,” Mokwena said about Mabasa. “But there is still a lot of work to be done on his off the ball movements, but over and above that, things that the media and supporters do not see is what a great human being the boy is. Extremely intelligent and understands tactics of the game. “He gives us a different profile to the other strikers who are also important. He comes to the team where he knows how important (Justin) Shonga, (Gabadinho) Mhango,(Zakhele) Lepasa are in the team, but he needs to compete for the role. Everybody else has to work for their positions at the club.” However, Mokwena said they will put celebrations on ice as they dig deep for their next three points against Bidvest Wits at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday night (8.15pm). And Mokwena said they will continue to be humble while carrying on with their hard work. “Credit to players... they were exceptional, they did what was expected. You know the future is bright when you have a group of talented players who are prepared to leave a piece of their skin on the pitch – not only sweat and blood. “It is just a matter of time and going through the process, we need to remain humble and continue to work hard, and that’s it.”
