Said Mosimane: “It is important to come together to address problems that affect our players because the players are human beings, to be honest.”Mosimane and Sundowns' next fixture is the Caf Champions League after the Fifa break. “It also a challenge to our teams to address xenophobia and gender violence. Sadly, we don’t have programs to address such things but there’s always a first time for everything," Mosimane added.
