Major
general Norman Sekhukhune told Parliament that the number of children assaulting
each other is concerning. He said
this while briefing the portfolio committee on Police on the crime statistics. Sekhukhune
said murders of children that were reported in the 2018/19 crime statistics is
1040 and that it is 29 cases more than the previous financial year. Sexual
offences against children have also increased by 899. On the
murders Sekhukhune said: “One thing that we need to mention in terms of the
murders that are committed against children, when we looked at the number of
crimes, or children in conflict with the law, we have observed that some of
these murders committed against children are committed by other children. The number
of murders committed by children is 736, that is instances where the children
are the perpetrators and not the victims of the murder.” Cops said
they decided to clarify the matter on murders by children. “There is a
perception that these murders maybe committed by adults but in some instances,
it is the very same children who are killing their peers. A recent
case in Evaton a 14-year-old stabbed a 17-year-old in school for a cell phone.
These are both children and one killed another,“ Sekhakhane said. The Eastern
Cape topped on provinces with highest murders by children as it stands at 231
followed by Western Cape with 170. Cele said
these killings between minors cannot exclude that they are gang related. “We
have not gone into detail to determine that actually it was during gang related
violence,” said Police minister Bheki Cele. Sekhukhune
said 4196 cases of common assault that have been committed by children were
recorded.
