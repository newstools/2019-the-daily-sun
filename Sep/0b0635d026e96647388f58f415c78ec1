 SOWETO is probably the last place bird-lovers would expect to flash their expensive binoculars and appreciate rare African birds. But Raymond Rampolokeng has put a twist at the face of kasi leisure by running nature appreciation tours, including bird viewing, bicycle tours and nature conservation programmes for young people in the area. Through Bay of Grace Tours, which he founded in 2008, the former Birdlife South Africa employee takes local and international guests to key bird sites ekasi. These include the Moroka Dam, wetlands of Orlando Towers, and the cliff in Pimville – a stone’s throw from the University of Joburg’s Soweto campus. He took the SunTeam on a typical tour exploring the wetlands and other bird habitats in his radius. Said Raymond: “Most birds come to the lake as the sun is about to set, but the ducks are the only constant feature throughout the seasons. “Other species found here include the white-breasted cormorant, reed warbler and the traditional herons.” He said tours were done in accordance to the needs of the guests depending on what they know about Soweto. “For instance, I prefer taking a walk when guiding people from overseas, so they have a true Soweto experience.” In a bid to combat pollution, Raymond also works with local schools educating the young ones about the importance of nature conservation. “Reaching out to schools to promote nature appreciation and conservation is a big step toward making Soweto greener.” – www.gauteng.net
