THE family of the late Thuli Khumalo (35) and neighbours protested yesterday. The people from Malukazi, south of Durban, staged a minor protest outside the Durban Magistrates Court. They wanted to voice their anger about the death of Khumalo, who was allegedly murdered by her baby daddy on Sunday. The suspect whom she apparently dumped months ago allegedly set her car on fire and attacked her when she went outside to see what was happening. The suspect (41) was in court for bail application which he decided to abandon. Resident Smangele Mbambo (48) said what he allegedly did to the Khumalo family was very cruel. “Thuli leaves behind three under-aged kids including his child,” said Smangele. “The sight of Thuli’s lifeless body and her mum collecting body parts won’t leave my mind.” Khumalo’s mum, Sizakele Khumalo (53), said the pain she felt was impossible to explain. “I will now have to raise these kids by myself. “I’m unemployed and only God knows where I’m going to get money to look after them,” said Sizakele. She said she didn’t want the suspect to return to the area. “He has caused me so much pain. I don’t want to see him get released. “He must remain behind bars, that’s where he belongs.” Magistrate Bonie Ngcobo postponed the case to 2 October for the postmortem results to be submitted.
