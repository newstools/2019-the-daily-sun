Patients and staff at the Mitchells Plain Day Hospital were
evacuated on Friday morning after a fire broke out, the City of Cape Town's
fire and rescue services said. Spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said they were still on the
scene and had contained the fire to the theatre section. He said he would provide more information once the fire had
been extinguished and the area was deemed safe.  Photos showed that a section of roof had been destroyed and
many rooms were gutted.
