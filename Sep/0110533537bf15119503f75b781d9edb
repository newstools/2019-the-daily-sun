DANCER Bontle Modiselle and long-term boyfriend rapper Priddy Ugly tied a knot in a traditional ceremony. The small private ceremony was held yesterday in Kempton Park. The traditional wedding was strictly for close friends and family. The couple who has a baby on the way have been together for ten years. Priddy paid lobola for Bontle last year, whereas he proposed to his lover in 2015. Sunday Sun sources said the couple waited to get their finances right for their big day. According to the source who is close to Priddy, the two met while they were in grade 10 and were both dancers. “Their relationship has always been magical and we knew that it will get here one day. Priddy adores Bontle and worships the ground she walks on, it is only right that they make it official because it has been a beautiful union. The ceremony was beautiful and meaningful because there were people who have witnessed them grow to be what they are today,” said the source. Another source said there will be another ceremonies after the one in Kempton Park at Priddy Ugly’s home and the other one will be held at Sun City. “Priddy Ugly’s mum is very fond of Bontle and ensured that the ceremony was respectful. Priddy Ugly was only allowed to invite five friends on his big day and his mother made sure that only five friends attended the wedding.”
