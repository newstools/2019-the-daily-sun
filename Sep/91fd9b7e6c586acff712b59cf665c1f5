The king told residents this year’s visit was different as it came at a time when the country was facing a crisis of violence against women. “We need to teach our boys how to behave as we do with girls,” said Madzikane. “We need to go back to our traditions. Men are protectors of women, but that isn’t happening. “It’s important to know where we come from. Girls used to walk around bare-breasted and were not raped.” Princess Sigudu (77) from Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape encouraged girls to go to school.

Athandiwe Ngalonkulu (25) said: “As soon as people hear you’re a virgin, they ask you a lot of questions.” Noluthando Marhasha (27) said people were always very curious about her love life. “I won’t have sex until I get married,” she said.
