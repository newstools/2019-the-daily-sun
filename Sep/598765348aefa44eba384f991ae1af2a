A “tariff” means a service charge payable by residents and businesses to recover the actual costs associated with delivering a service. Taking the main services into account, ratepayers will have to pay 10% more for water while electricity has gone up by 13,07%, as approved by the National Energy Regulator (NERSA). The property rates tariff increased by 6% from 1 July 2019 for all property categories. All residential properties are not charged any property rates on the first R150 000 of the property value. Pensioners, as well as persons with physical and mental disabilities, are granted rebates under policy conditions, while registered indigent residents are exempted from paying property rates. Sanitation charges are calculated in relation to the percentage of water discharged into the sewer system and a 10% tariff increase has been applied. Refuse removal charges are based on the container size of waste removed per week and has increased with 6%. Tariffs for city cleaning are levied on all premises, irrespective of who removes the refuse generated at the premises. The City of Tshwane reserves the right to determine the type of service, the minimum number of containers and the frequency of services per area. The basic social package helps to partly eliminate the potential financial burden of tariffs on poor households.
