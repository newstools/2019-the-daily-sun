ACTIVISTS at the weekend accused Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba of fuelling attacks on foreign nationals. Members of several organisations and unions marched in the city on Saturday to condemn xenophobia. They said foreigners were being denied healthcare, blamed for the country’s problems and murdered. They also called on Premier David Makhura to step in. ALSO READ:ANC JOBURG WANTS MASHABA GONE! Treatment Action Campaign youth leader Tebogo Tenyane said: “We are tired of politicians reading speeches that have been written for them. It’s time they deal with the problem of xenophobia head-on. “We’ve seen a number of cases where pregnant immigrants are sent from one healthcare centre to another. Some even give birth in the street. Access to healthcare is a basic human right.” The marchers handed over a memorandum to Joburg council speaker Vasco da Gama and Dan Bovu, an official in the premier’s office. Both were booed by the crowds. Da Gama said the council condemned the recent violence. He said the looting was criminal and assured marchers their demands would be addressed. The memorandum calls on Mashaba to stop making xenophobic comments and publicly apologise to the rest of Africa. General Industrial Workers Union president Mametlwe Sebei said: “We demand the premier to provide emergency relief for those who have been displaced because of the violence. We demand action be taken against people committing xenophobic acts.”
