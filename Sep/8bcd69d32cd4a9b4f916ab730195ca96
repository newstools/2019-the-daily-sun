SABELO Mbele and another student allegedly fought over a girlfriend last year and made peace in March. But Sabelo was allegedly stabbed by the other student on Thursday. He’s recovering at Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane. The 23-year-old Tshwane University of Technology student was apparently stabbed eight times on the Soshanguve campus. His mum Nozipho (48) said she suspected the attacker wanted to kill her son. “My son was stabbed in both knee caps, close to his lung, throat, buttocks and in the back.” Nozipho said they didn’t know what the cause of the stabbing was. She claimed her son was stabbed after the SRC elections. University spokeswoman Willa de Ruyter said: “A personal argument led to the stabbing. Three students sustained injuries when they were stabbed in what is alleged to be a personal argument. We harshly condemn the altercation.” She said the incident was not related to SRC elections. “The university is investigating and will work closely with the police to bring the perpetrators to book.” Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said: “Cops are investigating a case of attempted murder.”
