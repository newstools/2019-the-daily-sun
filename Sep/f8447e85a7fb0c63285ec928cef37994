While the entertainment industry is synonymous with the use of drugs, TV and radio star Pearl Modiadie claims to have never been exposed or offered drugs. Some stars, like  Uzalo's Simphiwe Majozi recently told Sunday Sun that he often n gets offed drugs by promoters at gigs he is booked at, Pearl on the other hand claims that she has never been offered drugs in the thirteen years she has been in showbiz. The Metro FM star shared this on her Twitter account, and wrote: "So often parents warn their kids about the entertainment industry being drug-infested. Never have I ever, in the 13 years I’ve been in this industry been offered drugs or even seen anybody take them. Or is it because I live in my own bubble?". In the comment section, singer and TV personality Khaya Mthethwa replied and said unlike Pearl's claims, he has been offered drugs by "our peers". "I’ve been offered a couple of years ago by our peers," Tweeted Khaya
