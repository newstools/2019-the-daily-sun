Nicholas Ninow has
pleaded guilty in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on Monday. The 22 year-old has
pleaded guilty to raping a seven-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant
in Pretoria in September last year. His trial started on
Monday and he was asked to plead to the charges of rape, assault, kidnapping,
defeating the ends of justice and possession of an illegal substance. He pleaded guilty to
all charges except for the kidnapping charge, which was withdrawn by the state. The 22-year-old was
found fit to stand trial after being evaluated by a team of four experts,
including psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist, in line with a 2018 court
order. He spent a month at
the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital. His trial is expected
to run from September 9 to 20. His legal team had
submitted that the alleged rapist had a history of mental illness and had been
using drugs since he was 14 years old.
