IF HE gets his way, Filipino senator and boxing champion Manny Pacquiao would have drug criminals executed by firing squad. That’s getting closer to becoming a reality in the Philippines, where in the past seven weeks, 21 bills have been filed before the lower house and Senate to reinstate the death penalty, covering crimes such as drug trafficking, rape and murder. It comes at the instructions of President Rodrigo Duterte, the self-styled “punisher” who’s know for his crackdowns on crime and war on drugs. Pacquiao, a staunch Duterte loyalist and the only boxer to win world titles in eight divisions, believes executions are the best deterrent for big drug syndicates. “We need it. In Asia, we’re one of the few countries without a death penalty, so a lot of drug lords and pushers came in. It’s alarming,” he said. “If you ask me, firing squad. But it depends on what the people want, as long as the death penalty is imposed.” But it isn’t clear if Filipinos really want capital punishment. Though opinion polls put Duterte’s approval rating at over 80%, the same surveys reflect mixed views on his policies, including a poll 11 months ago that showed less than a third of Filipinos agreed with reviving the death penalty. – REUTERS
