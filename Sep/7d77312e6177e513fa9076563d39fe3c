GCOBANI can’t believe he’s still alive after being stabbed eight times. Gcobani Mpondo (25) from Qandu-qandu in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, said three girls came to his shack on 14 September and demanded that he play their favourite track. “I asked who they were. When I told them to leave, they picked a fight with my girlfriend,” he said. As he was telling them to leave, one of them accidentally scratched her face. The girls eventually left but came back with three guys who broke the windows. “Luckily, I saw them at a distance and my girlfriend and I ran to my neighbour’s shack, but they saw where we hid,” said Mpondo. His neighbour didn’t want Gcobani to face the men but was worried about her sleeping baby. “I didn’t want the baby to get harmed and decided to go outside,” he told Daily Sun. “They started attacking me and I woke up in hospital with multiple stab wounds. “When we talk about ancestors working overtime, we’re talking about mine because the people wanted to kill me.” Gcobani said residents looked for the guy who stabbed him while he was in hospital and cops bust him. “I was told they dropped him off somewhere else,” he said. Gcobani said he was concerned about his safety as the people who attacked him were walking freely in the street. Captain Lowellan West from Khayelitsha site B said the suspect had not been arrested and was on the run. “I can get a special tracking team and they will arrest him with the help of the complainant,” West said.
