WILLIAM Mbatha’s granddaughter has been lying in the mortuary for eight months. And her spirit has started haunting the 75-year-old and other family members. William, from Wattville in Ekurhuleni, said bad luck had been following him.  Thugs recently tried to break into his house but he managed to scare them away. He said money was disappearing from his house and his business wasn’t doing well. “We can’t do any rituals because we need to bury my granddaughter first,” he said. His 21-year-old granddaughter Zandile’s body has been with the police forensics unit in Mpumalanga since she was found buried in a shallow grave in Agincourt Village, near Bushbuckridge. MY DAUGHTER'S BODY IS ROTTING IN FUNERAL PARLOUR “We don’t understand why they haven’t released the body to us because the suspect is the one who pointed out where it was. He told us he killed her in February after an argument. We’ve been waiting to bury her for eight months now,” said William. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said they were waiting for the postmortem results. “We ask the family to be patient. The court needs to be certain the remains belong to their granddaughter,” he said. Hlathi said the suspect would appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court tomorrow.
