RESIDENTS of Philippi East’s Pere Road in Cape Town are happy! This is after their drain was fixed. Daily Sun published their story, headlined “Kasi is full of kak”, on Friday. Neziswa Bomela (43) told the People’s Paper she couldn’t believe her eyes when city workers came to fix the problem. “We’re so happy and can finally stay outdoors and enjoy the sunlight,” said Neziswa. She said they were tired of smelling human waste. “It wasn’t healthy and we were concerned about our health.” Mandixole Tyuwa (39) said Daily Sun was their last hope.  “We normally see people getting help from the paper,” he said. “We’re happy the same thing happened to us.” Residents said Daily Sun was indeed the People’s Paper. They said they reported the blocked drain to the city more than a week ago.  Water and waste services mayoral Committee member Xanthea Limberg said the city runs educational programmes to make people aware of the impact throwing waste down the drain has on their infrastructure. “These range from face-to-face conversations with residents to the ‘Bin it, don’t block it’ drive,” she said. Limberg said drains across the province will continue to get blocked unless residents change their behaviour.
