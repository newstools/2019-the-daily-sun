WITH gender-based-violence in the limelight, Ixakatho, a woman’s group, is taking the bull by the horns. On Saturday, the group held an event at Shekainah Hall, Cape Town, to discuss challenges women face every day. Group founder Nelly Sithethi-Skade said: “We are telling women to break the silence. We are losing a lot of them because of the silence.” The group, started six years ago in East London, Eastern Cape, has been holding the events in each province. Last year they were in Port Elizabeth. Nelly said everyone is welcome to join. “We talk about people who are having difficulties in their marriages. We don’t advise them to stay even if their situation is bad,” she said. Ixakatho welcomes women from all walks of life and they do not exclude magoshas and lesbians. “As long as they are women, they are welcome to join us,” she said. Gospel singer Nolwando Solwandle said women needed to stop staying in abusive relationships because they are afraid what people will say. Nomazizi Magopheni (45) from Langa said she was always stressed because of her kids. “They were always drunk but not anymore. I got help from this group,” she said. Zimasa Mngebisa (40) said: “I struggled to get out of an abusive relationship, but that’s all in the past now. “I received the right advice in the group. “We pray to God to intervene and we pray for women to have the courage to talk about abuse. They must not keep quiet.”
