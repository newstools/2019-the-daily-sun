THE buzz around the second annual Cotton Fest is already in the air. This much anticipated festival that is curated and founded by rapper Riky Rick is expected to take place on 1 February 2020 at the Station (Newtown in Joburg). They focus on merging both known and unknown South African talent with the aim of showcasing the diversities in hip hop while fusing the gaps within the different local movements. This one-day urban music and fashion explosion is back with plans to be even bigger and better. Cotton Fest 2020 plans to bring together 100 unique acts performing on three different stages. The design team then worked on a new creative for the 2020 look and feel for the festival. It launched online today.  “Apart from the huge support we got from young people last year, the love we received for our simple logo was just insane. We were never ready for it to be honest. So we decided to flip it up again for the festival next year, we kept the aesthetic clean and fresh. We included some feel good characters to the logo. We tried to keep in tune with the drip, keeping in the fun and light heartedness” says Cotton Fest’s Riky Rick. “Hope the kids and culture love it because all about them. Looking forward to their response and support as always of course.”  he said MORE ABOUT THE FESTIVAL Cotton Fest 2020 returns to the Old Park Station in Newtown, Johannesburg with early bird tickets now on sale at Webtickets and Pick n Pay outlets nationwide. .
