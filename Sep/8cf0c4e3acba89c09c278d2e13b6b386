A GROUP of pastors practiced what they preached when they hosted a group of elderly people on Tuesday. The pastors, known as Abathunywa Ministers Fraternity, organised a lunch for them at Masonwabe Christian Church in Gugulethu, Cape Town. The pastors said they wanted to show the elderly, between the ages of 75 and 100 years, some love and appreciation. “Sometimes we forget that to be blessed you have to respect the elderly and treat them in a good way,” said group chairman Siphiwo Gunuza. “Most of them don’t have kids or grandchildren. Giving them this love will make them happy.” He said it was also a way of practising the gospel they preach. “I don’t have parents anymore. I treat all elderly people as my parents.” The gogos and madalas from the Cape Peninsula Organisation for the Aged said they loved being treated by the pastors. “I hope the Lord blesses them. They’re true men of God,” said gogo Lucy Sokhelwa (95). She said she didn’t know that the pastors had a plan to spoil them. “I thought it was going to be a talk about the Bible. I really appreciate what they did for us. It shows the elderly are not forgotten,” she said.
