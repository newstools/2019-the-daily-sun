ISHMAEL FACED death when armed thugs stormed into the church office. But he kept his cool and he kept his faith. “THE BIBLE SAVED ME FROM LIFE IN A WHEELCHAIR, LIFE WITHOUT A 4-5 OR EVEN DEATH!” Ishmael Mokheseng (50) told Daily Sun at about 11pm on Tuesday, after he had finished work at the Victorious Faith Ministries Church offices, three armed men barged in and demanded money. “One man pointed a gun to my head. I was worried they’d shoot my brains out,” said Ishmael from Mangaung phase 7. “I guess he was scared and nervous and his hand moved away when he pulled the trigger.” The bullet hit Ishmael’s lower body, near his private parts, and went through his left bum. “I collapsed and the thugs ran away. “Doctors said I was lucky. Not a single bone was damaged.” He said the bullet hit him near his thigh, missing his 4-5 and pelvic bones by inches.  Ishmael said the Bible saved him because, as he faced death, he remembered his favourite verse from Psalm 124 verse 6-8: “We have escaped like a bird from the fowler’s snare; the snare has been broken, and we have escaped.” Ishmael told the People’s Paper: “God stopped the bullet from harming me. I could have been wheelchair-bound, but God said no to the devil.” Ishmael was with church member Mphomotseng Tsoaeli (31) at the time. “We don’t keep cash on the premises, so they fled with my laptop, charger and laptop bag.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed: “We’re investigating a business robbery at a church. “The victim said they were at work when three unknown men approached them with firearms. “One of the church employees was shot in the thigh and taken to Pelonomi Hospital. “The suspects robbed them of car keys, a laptop and two security radios estimated at R12 000.” No arrests had been made.
