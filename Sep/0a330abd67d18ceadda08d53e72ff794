FINALLY Black Leopards have won at home. Out of seven Absa Premiership home outings, Leopards have lost twice and drawn one inn Venda, and that was always going to change with new coach Luc Eymael, who was watching the game from the stands, on board. Striker Mwape Musonda was the man to bring in the excitement to the Thohoyandou Stadium with a first half strike that saw Lidoda Duvha climb up the PSL table after a 1-0 win against Bloemfontein Celtic yesterday. Leopards did not sit back even after scoring as they continued with their dominance of the match with Musonda, Aro “Dax” Andrianarimanana and midfielder Lefa Hlongwane tormenting. Celtic goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane was called on numerous occasions to make good saves. Leopards goalkeeper Jonas Mendes became hero of the day for the home side after saving Ronald Pfumbidzai’s penalty with five minute before the break. This is second penalty Mendes saved in two consecutive league matches. Last week, the Guinea Bissau international saved a penalty in Leopards’s 2-2 draw against Maritzburg United. Truth be told, Leopards should thank Mendes for this victory as he made many saves in the second half with Celtic pressing them hard. The Thidielas, Leopards owners, must be crossing their fingers that Belgian coach Eymael’s work-permit is ready for their next match against Mamelodi Sundowns at the same venue on Wednesday night (7:30pm). This was Andrianarimanana’s first game for Leopards having joined them on a loan from Kaizer Chiefs.
