IF THEY don’t drain the toilets, the municipality may find its offices covered in kak! This is the warning from angry residents of Everest and Gugulethu squatter camps in Ekurhuleni. They told Daily Sun the contractors used to come twice a week to drain the toilets but they haven’t been seen in their kasis for two weeks. The residents said the smell is unbearable. “We have nowhere to relieve ourselves. We are forced to sit on the edge of the toilet seats,” said resident Annah Moloi. Community leader Zandiswa Mabandla said the contractors are not using chemicals. “The smell is bad because they are not using chemicals. Five families use one toilet and they get full quickly,” said Zandiswa. Resident Qelani Mngomezulu said there are about five contractors who have to clear the toilets. “Others come once a week. Some don’t pitch at all. Yet they are supposed to drain the toilets twice a week,” he said. “If the municipality employed people from our squatter camp to clean the toilets, we wouldn’t be in this situation because they will be staying here with us.” The residents told Daily Sun they’d rather go back to using pit toilets. They said they have complained to the municipality but don’t get any response. Acting spokesman for the municipality Solly Mashabela told Daily Sun: “Service providers come once a week as the number of toilets have been reduced to one toilet per five households. “Should residents need more toilets the city will investigate the number of households and add more.”
