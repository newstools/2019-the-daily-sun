A BURST water pipe has left parts of Tshwane with dry taps. Sunnyside residents had to queue for water after the pipe burst on Friday, causing the supply to be cut off at Fountains, south of the CBD. Caroline Mkhonza (24) said they had no choice but to fill buckets with water from the truck. She said it would be difficult to fetch water during the week as she had to go to work. Lizzy Lebese (35) said she hoped the pipe would be fixed quickly as she wasn’t used to carrying water in buckets. “For me, this is like exercise. After carrying buckets, I just go straight to bed,” she said. Municipal spokesman Lindela Mashigo said about 30 water tankers were placed at strategic points to supply water during repairs of the damaged pipe. Mashigo said the pipe was fixed on Sunday but water was only restored in some low-lying areas in Sunnyside. “High areas in Arcadia are still without water. Water will return in due course,” he said.
