The family of Minnie Dlamini-Jones is mourning the death of her younger brother Khosini, who passed away in hospital yesterday. The 29 year old Khosini had spent almost a month on life support and was falsely declared dead by social media but the family clarified that it was false at the time. Tlhogi  Ngwato, the Dlamini family spokesperson told Sowetan that Khosini passed peacefully in hospital, surrounded by the love of his family. The statement also confirmed reports that he had suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm which placed him on life support for 23 days. Aneurysm is an abnormal widening or ballooning in a blood vessel. It's usually caused by weakness in the wall of that blood vessel. "In this time of grief we ask for privacy and the opportunity to celebrate him,” he said.
