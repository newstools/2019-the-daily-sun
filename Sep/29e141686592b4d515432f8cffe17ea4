BRIAN Mhlongo (37) and Ernest Ndlovu (29) were granted bail of R1 000 each on Friday. The pair appeared before Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba at Mhala Magistrates Court inThulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. They were arrested for torching five huts belonging to a 69-year-old madala. They accused him and his family of evil deeds. The two men pleaded not guilty to charges of arson and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The court heard that community members, led by the accused, set alight the huts where madala Antoine Sibuyi was living with his four wives and six children at Hluvukani Village, outside Thulamahashe, earlier this month. The men told the court they knew nothing about the crime they were accused of and begged to be released on bail. Their lawyer Eric Mashele said his clients were not a flight risk and asked the court to release them on bail. The case was postponed for further investigation until 24 October. Meanwhile, cops are still appealing to the public to help catch suspects who killed Antoineâ€™s son, who was 25 years old. Anyone with information is urged to contact Captain Alfred Mashele at 082 968 4153 or the Crime Stop number 08600 10111.
