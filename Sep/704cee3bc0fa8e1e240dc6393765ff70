controversial content deal with pay-TV giant MultiChoice.  Last week, head of the SIU, advocate Andy Mothibi, updated
the National Assembly's oversight committee on communications, according to
TimesLive.  He told the committee that the first recovery claim against
Motsoeneng is for the R11m the SABC paid irregularly as a success fee for the
controversial contracts entered into with MultiChoice.  Another recovery of R10m stems from irregular appointments,
salary hikes, suspensions and unlawful terminations of contracts while
Motsoeneng was COO.  Counter-claim  According to the Sunday Times, Motsoeneng argues in his
counter-claim which has been filed in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg
that his deal netted the public broadcaster a R1.19bn profit and he is entitled
to compensation for raising money for the SABC.  He contends that the decision of the board to approve the
payment of his success fee, calculated at 2.5% of the R1.19bn less R1m, is
valid and binding on the SABC.  He remains steadfast that the R11.5m already paid to him in
the form of a bonus was only a part payment of the total owed to him.  eNCA reported that Mothibi told the committee that the SIU
had evidence that Motsoeneng was giving himself bonuses for doing his job.  "These success fees, our evidence reveals that this
would've been the fees paid based on some of the official work that Mr
Motsoeneng would have done in, call it negotiating or arranging contracts with
MultiChoice. In our view, those success fees have been paid irregularly to Mr
Motsoeneng," Mothibi said.  Motsoeneng told the Sunday Times that he would not comment
while the matter was in court.
