HUNDREDS of mourners bid a sad farewell to well-known actor Samson Ramabulana at the weekend. The funeral service of Ramabulana, who starred in radio and TV productions such as Elelwani and Muvhango, was held at AME Church in Shayandima in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, on Saturday. The former teacher and businessman last week succumbed to injuries he sustained in a car accident in June last year. He had been in and out of hospital.  Among those who came to pay their last respects were actors from SABC2 soapie Muvhango, on which he played the role of Nenzhelele. Archbishop Abraham Sibiya of the International Anglican Orthodox Episcopal Communion told mourners Ramabulana was a dedicated actor whose talent would be hard to replace. He described the actor’s death as a loss to the family and to the whole country. Ramabulana’s daughter Hulisani said her father was everything to the family. “He loved us and encouraged us to focus on education to be better people,” she said.  “He made long calls to us while we were at tertiary institutions.” Mathivha Seremane, who worked with Ramabulana on many radio dramas, said his colleagues had hoped he would recover after the accident. “We’re saddened by his passing,” he said. Ramabulana taught at various schools for many years. He retired in 2016 to concentrate on his businesses and acting. He’s survived by his wife Nditsheni and five children Lufuno, Lutendo, Lusani, Hulisani and Anza.
