KAIZER Chiefs coach, Ernst Middendorp, has blamed the international Fifa break for having “disrupted our momentum” following their 1-0 loss to Polokwane City at the FNB Stadium at weekend. He blamed the lack of competitive football as one of the factors that triggered his team’s first loss of the season. “We didn’t come to the party and I was a little surprised by that,” the German coach said after City skipper Jabulani Maluleke converted from a penalty kick to earn his side three points. The penalty was a killer blow for the Naturena lads after Amakhosi goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi brought down Rise and Shine forward Charlton Mashumba to leave the referee Masixole Bambiso with no choice but to point to the spot. City’s win ended Chiefs’ unbeaten run while recording their second successive 1-0 win away against the Soweto giants. “The break disrupted our momentum,” Middendorp said. “But I would also like to see the replay of the penalty as I believe it was not supposed to be given. “We played well before the break, but our rhythm was affected by this break. Hopefully we will click back into gear in our next game.” He felt that the referee was too harsh to award the visitors the spot kick while denying them what seem to have been a legitimate penalty in stoppage time, when Kearyn Baccus was brought down by City keeper Mwenya Chibwe inside the penalty area. Chiefs next play AmaZulu at KZN’s King Zwelithini Stadium with the hope of bouncing back and hold on to their lead at the top of the standings. Ironically, the loss ruined the German’s celebrations having won his first Absa Premiership Coach of the Month award this season last Thursday. Amakhosi’s talisman Khama Billiat started the game on the bench but failed to make an impact when he was called into action at the beginning of the second half. Middendorp said that he expects a lot better from his players in the next league game. “We will prepare thoroughly for AmaZulu,” he said.
