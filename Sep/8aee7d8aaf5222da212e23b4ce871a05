Fitness guru , Sbahle Mpisane seems to be picking up right where she left off. The 26 year old model who suffered a horrific accident that sent her in to coma is well on her way to recovery. Sbahle's recovery journey is inspiing many, and she’s only getting better and sharing her recovery on her social media pages. Sbahle hit the runway with House of St Luke's ensemble at the Durban Fashion Fair 2019 recently. The fitness model started off the show by entering the stage in a wheelchair, covered in a grey veil and then followed by several other models dressed in the designer's latest range. She titled the post "I am woman, hear me roar. #DFF"  I am woman, hear me roar. #DFF A post shared by  FitnessBunnie (@sbahle_mpisane) on Sep 25, 2019 at 11:41pm PDT  #DFF A post shared by  FitnessBunnie (@sbahle_mpisane) on Sep 26, 2019 at 7:45am PDT
