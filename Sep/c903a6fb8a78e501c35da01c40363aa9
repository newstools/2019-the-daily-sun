A KwaZulu-Natal student has died in hospital after being
stabbed in Sidakeni, Msinga, in the early hours of Sunday morning, police say. A close friend of the student - believed to be studying at the
University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) - revealed her identity as 22-year-old
Sinethemba Ndlovu. The friend also confirmed that her family had been informed
of her death. No arrests have been made yet and KwaZulu-Natal police are
investigating a case of murder. Police minister Bheki Cele said government needed to take a
tougher approach towards perpetrators of gender based violence on Saturday in
East London. According to police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala,
"she sustained two stab wounds below the left armpit and stomach. She was
taken to hospital for medical attention and she died in hospital". It's believed that Ndlovu was working as a hostess at the
Msinga Driftkhana motorsport event on Saturday evening. In a statement on Monday, event organisers said preliminary
reports suggested that, after the event, a few hostesses remained behind to
watch some of the musical performances after their shift ended. Event organisers said, after the hostesses' shifts had ended
around 22:00, they were informed that transport to their accommodation was
secured and, it is then that "it was reported to our coordinating team
that some of the ladies requested to remain behind as they wanted to witness
the musical performances taking place". "The group of ladies who had remained behind later left
the project venue, walking to their accommodation. On their way, sadly one of
them was attacked by unknown men and later passed [a]way in hospital,"
their statement read. Ndlovu's death comes weeks after the murders of Uyinene
Mrwetyana, Jesse Hess, Natasha Conabeer, Leighandr√© Jegels. The hashtag #RIPSne was trending on Twitter at the time of
publication, with many lamenting that every week there is a new victim of
violence against women.      SOURCE: NEW24
