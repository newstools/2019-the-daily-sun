One person has been killed in violence in the Johannesburg
city centre, according to police.  Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele also
confirmed that five people had been injured.  A group of men, some of them wielding sticks, pangas and
tree branches, marched through the city centre after disrupting a meeting in
which IFP President Emeritus Mangosuthu Buthelezi spoke to hostel residents
following a week of deadly xenophobic violence.  Makhubele said 16 people were arrested for public violence
and possession of stolen property.  Several shops were forced to close their doors as the
protesters damaged property and looted several businesses.  This is a developing story. More to follow.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/more-unrest-one-person-killed-5-injured-in-joburg-city-centre-20190908
