WHEN days are dark, friends are few. A young man learnt this the hard way on Monday afternoon after he tried to steal cables from a transformer substation.   When he tried to cut cables at the substation in Westdene, Joburg, he caught fire and instead of helping him, his two friends fled. Luckily for him, an Uber driver passing by stopped, took a fire extinguisher out of his car and put the flames out. However, the whole suburb was plunged into darkness. Witness Johannes Botha (36) told Daily Sun the man was covered in white and couldn’t stand still as he was in pain. “People must learn from this. Electricity is not something to play with,” he said.
