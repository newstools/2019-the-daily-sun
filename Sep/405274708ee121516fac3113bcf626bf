BLOEMFONTEIN CELTIC’s MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) coach Ditheko Mototo is not worried about his team’s slow start to the season. In the early stages of the season, the Young Siwelele have looked a shadow of the team that conquered all last season on their way to their maiden MDC title. This didn’t come as a shock to Celtic’s technical team of Mototo and Abram “Wire” Nteo, given the fact that they had to start their team from scratch after the bulk of the squad moved on. The defending champions have found the going tough, only managing to win two of their four matches so far with the other two ending in defeat. They anticipate a tough season ahead, but that hasn’t stopped Mototo and his charges in their quest to defend the title. “We have a new team altogether so we were always going to find it a bit difficult especially in the early stages,” Said Mototo: “This team can to challenge given a little bit of time. They’re talented are hard-workers who are willing to learn. I expect this team to grow as the season progresses.“Bear in mind, the matches we lost were against Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates – two very well organised and disciplined teams who have played with more or less the same players they had last season.” Celtic will partipate in the festival action today at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban as they lock horns with Kaizer Chiefs (12pm). Sundowns will conclude the day’s action when they face AmaZulu (3pm). In other MDC games today Stellenbosch FC face Baroka at Malta Park Sports Ground while Black Leopards face Bidvest Wits at Tohoyandou Stadium (10am).
