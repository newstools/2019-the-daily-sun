HIS 4-5 grew every day! And he masturbated for years because no woman wanted him. Daily Sun published a story on 6 June about how Sanele Skosana’s giant 4-5, which hung between his knees, gave him sleepless nights. “I used to be in so much pain and the growing was depressing me,” said the 25-year-old from Middelburg, Mpumalanga. But SunPower came to Sanele’s rescue. He said he received calls from sangomas a few days after Daily Sun published his story. “I was obviously scared and thought what if I get someone who just plays mind games with me,” said Sanele. He said he was fascinated by one female caller. “She told me she had dealt with this kind of problem, so she gave me hope,” he said. He went to her place and they immediately started dealing with his giant 4-5. He said it took three appointments with her per week. She gave him something to apply to his body and a imbiza to clean his body. “I noticed changes within three weeks of the treatment and I’m now free from whatever made my 4-5 grow,” he said. “My 4-5 hasn’t shrunk, but has stopped growing. I’m happy. I never thought I’d be free from masturbating. It was a lot, 20 times a day was just terror. I’m grateful to Daily Sun. I’m a happy man again.” The People’s Paper spoke to Gogo Mamtolo Masango (54), the sangoma who helped Sanele. “I decided to help him without charging him. I hope other people with the same problem will come forward,” she said.
