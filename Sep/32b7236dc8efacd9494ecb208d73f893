REIGNING South African flyweight champion Jackson “M3” Chauke will finally get his big international break and has promised to make best of it. The seasoned pugilist will take on six fights novice champion, Mekhdi Abdurashedov, for the World Boxing Council (WBC) international belt on 18 September in Russia. After the former amateur star struggled to attract big fights on paid ranks, he’s vowed to grab the golden opportunity with both hands. “I’ve been waiting for this chance to showcase my boxing skills on a highest level. I’m happy that day has come. I promise to make the best of it,” said Chauke. The former Olympian hopes to emulate his teammate, Ilunga Makabu Jr, who successfully defend his crown against Aleksei Papin to retain his WBC Silver cruiserweight title. “Makabu Jr’s performance has inspired me to work twice as hard to bring back the title. We regard him as our role model. I have what it takes to dethrone the champion.” he said. “I watched his videos. He’s a talented fighter, but is no much threat. Abdurashedov is a typical European fighter. I know what to expect from him.” He has not met opponent of my calibre, all his previous foe I think were carefully chosen for him,” he said. After a colourful amateur career for the 34-year-old former World Boxing Federation (WBF) the grass was not green on other side. Despite, producing good results he never had a breakthrough. The former Commonwealth silver medals from Ivory Park in Tembisa blamed the stagnancy of his career to previous handlers. Chauke has registered 18 victories, a single defeat and a draw while his 20-year-old opponent is unbeaten on six outings. This will be maiden title defence for a Russian prospect for a title he won in April. He managed to score a technical knockout over Frank Kiwalabye from Uganda.
