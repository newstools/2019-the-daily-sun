GATVOL residents torched the shack of a man accused of sexual assault. Khayelitsha community leader Simphiwe Nxusani told Daily Sun the 52-year-old man was arrested last week after kids told their parents he allegedly made them play with his 4-5. He said the community took the suspect to Khayelitsha Police Station. “There were people who wanted to beat him up. We spoke to them not to attack him,” said Nxusani. He said the suspect allegedly gave the kids money after he asked them to play with his 4-5. “After he was granted bail the people decided to take down his shack. They don’t want him back in the community,” he said. Resident Portia Xhego (37) said they are shocked that the suspect got bail. “That man deserves to stay in jail, but we cannot go against the law,” said Portia. PICS: BABSIE IS HOME AFTER YEARS IN THAI JAIL Resident Nomsa Gwiji (40) said they shouldn’t have taken the suspect to the police. “We should’ve sorted him out while we still had time. It would be better for him to not come close to us. We will deal with him.” “He is a monster. Who knows if he raped some of the kids?” Residents were angry the suspect got R500 bail. They felt the law didn’t care about the kids. WOMAN GETS LIFE FOR KILLING EX'S SON Western Cape NPA spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said the man was charged with sexual assault. He said bail was set at R500 and it was up to the man to pay and be released. The suspect will appear again on 20 November.
