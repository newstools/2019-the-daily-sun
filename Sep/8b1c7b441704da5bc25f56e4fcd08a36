GOGO Dineo has a long client list, most of whom are celebs! But some people recently have come out to say she’s fake and charges too much. Gogo Dineo said she underwent ukuthwasa training in 2010 in Soweto. She said on her journey to become a sangoma she never forced anyone to do anything their ancestors didn’t agree with. “I’ve never invited anyone to thwasa at my institute. I’m very strict when it comes to that. You need to have dreamt of me or my home more than once before becoming one of my spiritual children.” She said she did things differently from other gobelas. “After the ancestors direct a person to me, I take them in for two weeks just so they can see what other thwasas do on a daily basis and for them to be sure this is something they’d be willing to take on.” Gogo Dineo said this involved family members, dedication and to listen to your ancestors’ communication. She said the process was costly. “Consultation exclusively with me costs R1 550. Consulting with my senior assistants costs R500,” she said. Asked how she housed two indumbas at her home, she explained one was hers, while the other one belonged to her ex-husband, who’s also her spiritual son, Mkhulu Mkhatshwa. Mkhulu Mkhatshwa told the SunTeam he also had a calling, but never paid that much attention to it until bad things started happening. “I was more hands-on with helping Gogo Dineo on her journey. People should also know my ancestors specifically picked their makoti to be my gobela before she even completed her ukuthwasa training,” he said. He said their relationship as sangomas worked better than the one they had as a married couple. “Our ancestors are very much in sync and having two ndumbas doesn’t necessarily mean she does her own thing. We help each other and our clients are treated equally. If there is a client I can’t help, I refer to her and she does the same.” Gogo Dineo has been featured on Metro FM and 702, and has 400 000 Instagram and 36 000 Twitter followers.
