Ephesians 4:31-32 says: “31Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as Christ God forgave you.” Emotional control is one of the most important part of our lives. Emotions build or ruin relationships. The first murder recorded in the Bible was caused by anger. Cain killed his own brother Abel out of anger. To date, many people have followed in the footsteps of Cain and killed their loved ones. Husbands have killed wives; parents have killed kids; wives have killed husbands;boyfriends have killed their girlfriends; friends have killed friends; business partners have killed fellow business partners and so forth. These murders are fuelled by emotions, especially anger. Anger makes a person take wrong decisions. Many people have taken permanent decisions based on a temporary feeling that must be controlled. Bitterness, anger, rage, brawling and slander are all emotions and are unstable and temporary. Our ability or inability to bring these emotions under control determines our fate. Child of God, I’m writing to you to urge you not to make permanent decisions based on temporary circumstances. Often all these emotions including anger are justified. There is a reason to anger and at times such reasons are justified. It is wrong to mete wrong with another wrong. God urges us to get rid of anger and negative emotions.
