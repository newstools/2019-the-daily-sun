FOR years the cop used to take a few days off, claiming to be sick. He even had a doctor’s note as proof. But the SAPS didn’t know the warrant officer wrote the sick notes from his house! To make matters worse, the 53-year-old cop also sold the fake sick notes for six years without getting caught. But the long arm of the law finally caught up with the cop, who’s attached to the protection and security services in Polokwane. He was arrested in Seshego, outside Polokwane, Limpopo, on Wednesday. According to police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, the cop and his wife (52) sold the sick notes and prescription scripts from their home in Seshego. The officer was recently caught when he submitted the sick note with a leave form. “We were notified and started with investigations, which revealed that the wife worked for a medical doctor in the area. She allegedly stole documents with the doctor’s letterhead when she got fired,” said Ngoepe. He said the warrant officer allegedly issued over 20 sick notes to himself. Ngoepe told Daily Sun the couple charged their clients a standard amount, but he refused to say how much as it formed part of their evidence. The officer’s wife was also bust on Wednesday night together with a 38-year-old data typist attached to the Seshego cop shop. The suspects will appear in the Seshego Magistrates Court today.
