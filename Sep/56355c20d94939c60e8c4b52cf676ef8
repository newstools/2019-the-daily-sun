After a long delay, Blue Label Telecoms [JSE: BLU] finally released its results for the year to end-May. Last week the JSE threatened to suspend the company’s shares because it has not yet released its results for the year to end-May. The JSE set a final deadline of September 30. With revenue down 3% to R25.9bn, Blue Label reported a headline loss of 312.49c per share for the year to end-May.  While Blue Label’s core business – including providing airtime, data starter pack and prepaid electricity services – remains profitable, Cell C, which suffered a trading loss of R1.56bn for the year, wreaked havoc on its results. Including write-offs, Cell C contributed a loss of R3.6bn to Blue Label, which owns 45% in the mobile operator.   The ability of Blue Label to continue as a going concern is dependent on whether these (and other) transactions entered into subsequent to year-end noted above, as well as the continued support from financial institutions, the results noted.
