PHOTOGRAPHER Blunt Moyo wants Mzansi to embrace their unique private parts. Moyo and sculptor Angie Malay are hosting a genital dialogue. Yep! A genital dialogue.  The sexuality and intimacy exhibition started in Tshwane in May. Blunt said the genital dialogue is about an artistic and different view on human genitals. “The project focuses on issues of genital shaming, which often leaves one embarrassed and with low self-esteem,” said Blunt. He said during the dialogue, he discovered it was somehow acceptable for women to speak about masturbation, while it’s taboo for a man to say he masturbates. “One gets judged for doing that. We also spoke about how masturbation can help fight rape culture,” he said. “Some people said they don’t play sex games with their partners. “It’s advisable to play such games. It helps with intimacy and understanding your partner.” READ: PICS: BABSIE IS HOME AFTER YEARS IN THAI JAIL Guests at the show on Saturday were invited to donate sanitary towels, which will be donated to school girls. “We want to make a difference in the lives of young girls,” said Blunt.
