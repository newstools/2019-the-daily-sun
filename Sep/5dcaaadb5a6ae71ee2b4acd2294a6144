KHUMBUZILE Xaba’s four babies died in June 2017, and she buried them two weeks later. The sad incident haunts her and is destroying her life. READ: 'KILLER' DAD IS NOT APPLYING FOR BAIL! Instead of issuing a death certificate for her kids, Home Affairs put Khumbuzile’s name on the document. “I can’t apply for jobs or loans because I’m told I’m a ghost,” she said. “How could they make such a stupid mistake? I feel as if bad luck is following me.” At the time, Khumbuzile from Lehae near Lenasia blamed Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. Speaking to Daily Sun at her children’s graves recently at Olifantsvlei Cemetery, just outside Soweto, Khumbuzile said she couldn’t go on with life. After the children died Daily Sun published a story. READ: NWABISA WAS KIDNAPPED AND KILLED! Khumbuzile was convinced the deaths were caused by negligence. She was carrying three boys and a girl and went into labour when she was seven months’ pregnant. “I thought my children were going to live. I was happy when I heard them cry, but hospital staff later told me they had all died. “I was devastated and blame nurses for being negligent. They never attended to me until the last minute,” she said. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola advised Khumbuzile to visit the nearest Home Affairs office to have the mistake corrected as soon as possible.
