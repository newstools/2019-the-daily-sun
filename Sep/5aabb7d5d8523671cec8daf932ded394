EKURHULENI cops were yesterday still searching for Amahle Thabethe (8), who’s been missing for four months. Amahle was allegedly kidnapped by a man who pretended to be lost and asked for directions.  She was playing with friends in the street outside her home. Divers and sniffer dogs looked for her in streams yesterday while investigators went into five houses. The search started at about 10am.  Cops said they didn’t want to leave any stone unturned.  Investigations had been going on for months following Amahle’s disappearance in April. Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu of Tsakane cop shop said police were following all leads. Amahle’s mum Nokulunga Nkosi told the People’s Paper: “I appeal to people to help cops with genuine information.” Meanwhile, cops warned the public to stop posting fake information on social media. “Some posts claimed they knew her whereabouts but it turned out to be false,” said Mngomezulu. She said cops would continue searching for Amahle and following leads. “We’re appealing to community members who have information to come forward,” said Mngomezulu. Anyone with information may contact Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Ratsupa on 082 584 2319 or 011 365 5877.
