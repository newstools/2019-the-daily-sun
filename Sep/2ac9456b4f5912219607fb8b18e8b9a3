COMMUTERS from Strand in Cape Town were left terrified after the train they were travelling in derailed at Bellville Station yesterday morning. According to Metrorail, 42 people were treated for minor injuries. Commuters told Daily Sunthey thought they were all going to die. Tatenda Jiri, who travels from Strand to Cape Town to work every day, said: “I heard squeaking sounds as the carriage tilted to one side. People in my carriage started screaming and fell on top of each other as the train stopped. I was terrified. “I tried to find out what was going on. I realised there was an accident. I thought we were going to die.” Lelethu Mzula (28), who escaped with small scratches on her arm, said: “I was hurt when I was rushing out of the train. “I have never been in a train accident before. “I will use the bus to go home today.” Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said three carriages derailed on the Kuils River side of Belville Station. She said the matter was being investigated. United National Transport Union spokeswoman Sonja Carstens said: “This derailment could have been prevented had President Cyril Ramaphosa kept the promise he made in front of us and several media houses a month before the election.”
