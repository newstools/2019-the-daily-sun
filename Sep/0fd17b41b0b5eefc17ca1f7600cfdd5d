THIS interesting book focuses on the positive side of the mind and out-of-the-box thinking to make your business successful. It has interesting characters and the power to change people’s views about business.  Reading a chapter a day could change the way you think. I especially loved the critical thinking questions at the end of each chapter. I almost put the book down after reading a section mentioning US President Donald Trump, but I continued because it opens your mind to new possibilities. Though the author makes an error of repeating the same points, the book could have a positive impact on how you see the world and the challenges we come across in life. Most people love to hate the wealthy, as they think money’s the root of all evil. But this book lays out the pure and simple truth of the difference between the one percent of those living in wealth and everyone else who’s scraping by. If you want to know what really separates the world-class from the middle-class, this book is a good place to start.
