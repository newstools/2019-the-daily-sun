BLACK LEOPARDS have parted ways with their coach Lionel Soccoia. The Frenchman, who replaced Dylan Kerr in June becomes the third coach in the Absa Premiership to lose his job following Clinton Larsen and Cavin Johnson who were sacked by Chippa United and AmaZulu on Monday respectively. Soccoia was fired with his entire technical team including team Manager Professor Ngubane and assistant coach Patrick Mabedi. "Due to the outcry from the fans about the poor performance and results of the team, we agreed to part ways with the coach,' Leopards tweeted.
