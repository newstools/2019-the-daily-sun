THE ex-boyfriend allegedly threw a petrol bomb at their home on Sunday, burning everything inside. But even though the Sigentsu family from KwaThema, Tsakane, is now homeless, they chose to forgive him. People caught the suspect and tried to burn him alive, but the family saved him and handed him over to cops.  “We left everything in the hands of God. We understand people’s anger, but an eye for an eye will never save the world,” said Priscilla Sigentsu. “People were angry and wanted revenge on our behalf, but we decided they should let him go.” Priscilla said her younger sister Nomvula’s boyfriend allegedly abused her. “She even had a protection order against him. She told him she wanted to part ways, but he refused. “He stalked her and even vowed to burn her and her kids,” she said. On Sunday, he threw a petrol bomb where the kids had been sleeping. “They could have burnt to death had it not been for the eldest, who told us she smelt petrol and then it was hot. “She woke her siblings and they ran into the kitchen. She tried to put the fire out using water, but it flared out of control. The kids escaped, but the house burnt with everything inside.” An angry mob caught the suspect and he confessed. The family felt pity for him and asked them to release him. A man has been arrested. Constable Media Khoza said a case of arson was opened.
