Sdudla Somdantso’s raising the flag for curvy women. She released a single, High Life, last Friday. Sdudla, whose real name is Abongile Ntloko (21), is from Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape. She told SunBuzz the song was meant to motivate plus-sized women to never look down on themselves. “Society has this stigma that your body is against you and you can’t do anything when you’re a big woman,” she said. “I’m hear to show people that when you’re gifted, it doesn’t matter how big or small you’re – you’ll achieve whatever you put your mind to.” She said the title was inspired by the way she dances, even though she’s a plus-sized woman. “I came up with the name because I’m big and can dance. I’ve always seen myself as a performer, and I joined a choir at primary school. I always knew that one day I’d make it in the entertainment industry. After matric I focused on my music career, and that was the best decision I made,” she said. Sdudla said she brought new sound when she started a gqom called dimoni with Ed Harris. “Gqom is popular where I come, so I thought I could play around and explore a new sound. My single is a mix of amapiano with deep tech and house. It’s produced by Dramatic Boys featuring Oskido. I’m excited about it. I feel it’s going to bring change to the music scene. “I’m happy to be signed by Oskido. The aim is to make more music that inspires every type of women. We need to love and support one another because we’re going through a lot of difficulties these days,” she said.
