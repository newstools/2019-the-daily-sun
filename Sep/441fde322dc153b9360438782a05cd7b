SOUTH Africa Under-23 skipper Tercious Malepe says having shared the experience he gained during the 2016 Rio Olympics with the current crop will inspire the team to qualify for next year’s Tokyo Olympics in Japan. Malepe is the only player in the current team that was at the 2016 Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil under coach Owen Da Gama. Coach David Notoane’s charges started their quest to Tokyo with a 5-0 drubbing of Zimbabwe in their first leg Africa Cup of Nations qualifier played at Orlando Stadium on Friday. The Afcon also serves as a qualifier for the Olympics. Yesterday, they travelled to Zimbabwe for the second leg scheduled for tomorrow (3pm) in Bulawayo. “I sat down with the players to share my experiences and told them it is important for us to qualify. Every athlete dreams of being an Olympian. And I also want to go back and gain more experience of playing against the best at the Olympics next year,” said Malepe. Malepe admitted that with this huge lead they might relax, and he warned his side to avoid complacency sighting that Zimbabwe can overturn the deficit at home. He said: “We must forget about this victory and focus on the second leg. I think we were at our best on the day and we will need that motivation going to Zimbabwe.” The Under-23s’ are eyeing a ticket to the eight-nation Afcon event which will be played in Egypt later this year, where they’ll need a top-three finish to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
