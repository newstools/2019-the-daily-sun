Former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe has died at the age of 95. The current president of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa made the announcement on his official Twitter account saying: “It is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing on of Zimbabwe's founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe.” He further said that Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. “His contribution to the history of our nation and continent will never be forgotten. May his soul rest in eternal peace,” Mnangagwa added. Mugabe was born to a poor family in Kutama, Southern Zimbabwe. Following an education at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a schoolteacher in Southern Zimbabwe, Northern Zimbabwe, and Ghana. He was angered that Southern Zimbabwe was a colony of the British Empire governed by its white minority. Mugabe then embraced Marxism and joined African nationalist protests calling for an independent state led by representatives of the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. After he was released, he went into exile in Mozambique, he then established the leadership of ZANU PF, and oversaw ZANU's role in the Rhodesian Bush War, fighting Ian Smith's government. He reluctantly took part in the peace negotiations brokered by the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement. The agreement ended the war and resulted in the 1980 general election, at which Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory.
