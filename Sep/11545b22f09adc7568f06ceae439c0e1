DESPITE AmaZulu having started their season on a poor note, Golden Arrows are cautious that their neighbours  still pose an acid test. The two teams from Durban will square off in the Durban Derby number 22 at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Arrows, who will be home team, will go to this game having collected seven points from four games. They have won two, lost once and drawn the other one. On the other hand, Usuthu have been a team that the inspiration has been in short supply. They have lost three, drawn one in the first opening four games this season. They are rooted at the bottom of log table with one point, having scored just once this season. They have been talks that coach Cavin Johnson, if he can’t get a win in this one, heads will roll. AmaZulu’s last win dates back last season when they defeated SuperSport United in April. Since then, it is now seven games without a victory for Usuthu. “It is difficult one for us against AmaZulu. We all know how much energy they carry in their game,” admit Komphela. “Cavin Johnson is hell of a good coach and their squad is good as well.” While Abafana Bes’Thende have started the 2019-20 season much better then their opponents, they should also go to into this clash confident too. All Arrows two wins this season have come at their backyard. However, Komphela is wary of Usuthu that they can rise up against his side with an addition that this is a provincial rival side. “It is derby. Listen, in a derby, nothing matters. All the form, all the stats, goes out of the window,” said the former Maritzburg United coach. “At the end of the day, it is question of who performs better on the day. I just hope on the day we pitch.”
