IF it were up to Pitso Mosimane, Jeremy Brockie would feature for Maritzburg United against Mamelodi Sundowns in their league PSL fixture on Saturday. However, it appears the decision doesn’t entirely lie with the Sundowns coach, but rather with the club management. Brockie has joined the Team of Choice on a season-long loan, primarily due to a lack of game time.As per the clause in the agreement between the two clubs, the Kiwi is not be eligible to play against the club that pays his salary. Naturally, Brockie would relish playing against his parent club… to prove a point or two to his parent club.But it appears he will be in the stands when United visit the Brazilians at Lucas Moripe Stadium. Mosimane has sounded unsure on whether Brockie will be allowed to play or not. But he has no qualms about seeing the Kiwi on the field. “I don't know if Brockie is going to play. I have read about it, so probably Sundowns can answer that,” said Mosimane. “All I know is that all the players who have gone the other side have played against us. I have never been informed about that.”
