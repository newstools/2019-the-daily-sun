DAVEYTON Hearts Athletics Club members are working around the clock to make sure that their coming 10km race in September is a huge success. The Blue Army, as the rapidly growing club is fondly known, will be hosting a sequel of the Mayfield 10km Challenge on 22 September in Daveyton. Last year, the club hosted their inaugural race and it was embraced with open arms by the runners, watchers-on and by the community in general. The race included a 1,6km Street Mile for the kids and 5km for social runners – the distances and events will be the same again this year. This athletic club is about encouraging individuals and citizens of Daveyton to take up road running as a way of life and keeping a healthy and fit lifestyle at the same time. As part of the festivities to make the run memorable, there will be four ‘running buses’ for a sing-along, meet and greet and comradeship. The race will start and finish at the Mayfield Square in Daveyton. If you’re looking to finally break sub 1:00 in the 10km, then the Mnandi bus will be there to help you achieve your goal. There will also be the executive bus which will arrive at the finishing line in sub1:15. Well known bus Tallguy will drive his bus with an expected arrival of sub1:30. The Sub halala bus, which undertakes a more sexy pace, will be specially-designed for fun lovers and social runners. The Daveyton Hearts’ development coach, popularly known as Thulani “Sash” Sibeko, will be there to break sub 32 minutes on his home turf. Sash has made a bold declaration that the sub 32:00 record will fall on the day. Lizzy Ramadimetja will be one of the top runners who will grace the event. She is a Two Oceans top 10 finisher and has also finished in the top 20 bracket at Comrades Marathon. Kataki Senyatsi, a well-known Mzansi runner and socialite, will add some spark into the race.
