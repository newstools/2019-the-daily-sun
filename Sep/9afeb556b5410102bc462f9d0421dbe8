TRAGEDY struck at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital on Saturday when a 27-year-old mum took her life after giving birth and being moved to a ward. Hospital CEO Nkele Lesiya said: “Her relatives couldn’t find her. She was seen going to the toilet shortly before visiting hours started.”  A search was started and she was found hanging in one of the toilets. “I don’t think this is something we could have prevented. We don’t have permission from the family to go into the nitty-gritty of the case,” Lesiya said. According to Mayo Clinic, a health website offering health advice, suicide after giving birth may be caused by powerful emotions, ranging from excitement and joy to fear and depression.
