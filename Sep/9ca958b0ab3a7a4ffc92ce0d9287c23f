Police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the robbery took place at about 7.30am at the corner of Asetileen and Foundry streets. “The van was transporting cash to Mayville when a white Nissan NP200 drove in front of it,” he said. “The driver of the Nissan got out of the bakkie and pointed a pistol at the driver of the cash van.” Naidoo said about 16 suspects armed with rifles approached the van and fired several shots in the air.

When they exited the van, the guards were forced to lie down on the ground while the robbers took one guard’s firearm,” said Naidoo. He said bags of money were taken out of the van before the robbers fled the scene in a white BMW, white VW Caddy and a silver Audi A4. “The Nissan bakkie caught fire after it hit a pavement,” he told Daily Sun. “It was found through the VIN number that it was stolen in Olievenhoutbosch last month.”
