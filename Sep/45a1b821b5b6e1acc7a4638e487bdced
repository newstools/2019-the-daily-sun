THE father who allegedly killed his four kids in the Pinetown area, west of Durban on Tuesday won't apply for bail. This emerged during his brief appearance in Pinetown Magistrates Court today. The 44-year-old Sibusiso Mpungose appeared in this court following his arrest on Wednesday. He is accused of hanging his biological kids Kuhlekonke (4), Khwezi (6), Sphesihle (10) and his stepdaughter Ayakha Jiyane (17). The alleged fetched Kuhlekonke, Khwezi and Sphesihle from their schools and hanged them in different bedrooms in his home in Wyebank before he fetched Ayakha in Pinetown Girls High School and hanged her in the bush near New Germany. In a court that was packed to capacity, the magistrate told the accused that he is facing four counts of murder that he allegedly committed intentionally. "You are facing four counts of murder. You are accused of unlawfully and intentionally murdering Khwezi Mpungose (4), Khwezi Mpungose (6), Sphesihle Mpungose (10) and Ayakha Jiyane (17). The court has heard that you will not be applying for bail, so the matter is remanded for 9 October for further investigation," said magistrate. Outside court different political parties staged a manor protest where they voiced out their anger over the incident through placards and toned-down chanting of songs. Daily Sun ran a story on the horrific killing of the deceased which is suspected that it was triggered by the long-standing domestic violence that the accused had been doing towards his wife, Xoli Mpungose (the mother of the kids). It is alleged that on the day of the incident, the accused wife had served him with divorce papers.
