LIVING with a disability didn’t stop Nokwethemba Vilakazi from participating in this year’s reed dance. The celebration took place at Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, northern KZN, on Friday and ended on Sunday. The 27-year-old from Umlazi V section, south of Durban, said although she’s in a wheelchair, she started taking part in the annual celebration in 2003. “I was sitting at home one day and thought to myself: ‘Most of the time, people living with disabilities don’t have role models and look down on themselves. They don’t participate in things like this’.” Nokwethemba said she wanted to show them they, too, could go for virginity testing. She said she’d go to the dance until she got married. “It’s my wish to get married one day, and I want to enter into marriage while I’m still pure.” She said she didn’t have a boyfriend but wasn’t stressed about it. “I’m focusing on my work at the moment because I like being independent,” said Nokwethemba. “I’m busy working and saving money, and I’ll see boyfriends when the time is right.”
