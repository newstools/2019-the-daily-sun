AMAZULU management are concerned about Usuthu’s poor start to the Absa Premiership season. The Durban-based side are yet to win a match, having lost three and drawn the other. They are languishing at the bottom of the table, with only one point. Cavin Johnson’s coached side have scored just one goal and conceded six so far, and this has left general manager Lunga Sokhela worried. However, Sokhela said their slump start should stop with their next league game against Golden Arrows in a Durban derby at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on 14 September. In fact, their winless run dates back to last season when they last won against SuperSport United on 24 April. Since then, Usuthu have gone seven matches without victory. “The next game is a must-win for us,” Said Sokhela, who seems surprised by the way his team have started. “We had a good pre-season and this comes as huge surprise why the club is struggling this way.” On the other hand, Arrows have had a positive start, having won twice and lost one, while they drew the other league game. They are sixth on the league table with six points. But Sokhela is optimistic they will turn the corner at the expense of their neighbours. Usuthu should draw some encouragement heading to that game, having beaten Arrows two times in their last three meetings. Added Sokhela: “We have to turn the corner at some point, otherwise our season will be bad.” Speculation is rife that Johnson could be sacked if he fails to win this game, but Sokhela has dismissed the rumour as hogwash. “There’s no directive from management that if he can’t win this game, then heads will roll. We are just not happy how we have started this season. “It is unfortunate that we haven’t got the results we wanted.”
