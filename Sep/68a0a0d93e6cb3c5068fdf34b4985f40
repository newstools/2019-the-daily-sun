AUDI SPORT has unveiled two new stylish performance SUVs, the RS Q3 and RS Q3 Sportback. These two performance SUV’s offer outstanding performance and athletic design. These monsters are powered by the 2.5-litre five-cylinder turbocharged petrol mill which produces over 294kW of power and 480Nm of torque.  The German automaker claims it will take the RS Q3, 4.5 seconds to sprint from 0 km/h to 100 km/h. Well, it’s one thing to have lots of power but, if the transmission is crap, all the power won’t get to the wheels. The 294 kw is sent to the wheels by a quattro all-wheel drive seven-speed S tronic automatic transmission.  To top the performance version up, Audi has used the RS sport suspension which lowers the body by 0.4 inch compared with the Audi Q3 and Q3 Sportback.  The sporty tuning complements the basic requirements for the outstanding handling of the two sport compacts. The RS-tuned progressive steering also conveys close contact with the road even on fast bends.  Now, it’s would be useless for the SUV just to be fast, it also must look the part, buyers will have the choice of going for the standard 20-inch rims or the optional Audi Sport 21-inch wheels. While the singleframe with no color-contrasting surround in the compact SUV creates an even sharper impression. The gloss black grill with three-dimensional honeycomb structure is inset deeper and directly into the RS bumper with its large side air inlets. The striking boomerang-shaped blades in the bumper are designed exclusively for the RS Q3 according to Audi. The RS genes are also apparent in the flat slits above the Singleframe radiator grille.
