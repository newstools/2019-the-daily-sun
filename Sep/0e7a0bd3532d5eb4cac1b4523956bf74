MANY people were left in shock yesterday after a video showing a nurse being attacked by a patient went viral on social media. Nurses at Pholosong Hospital in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, saidthey didn’t feel safe anymore. CCTV footage shows a patient coming up behind a nurse and choking her. She loses consciousness and he takes her cellphone. A nurse told Daily Sun: “We can’t come to work to be attacked by the very people we’re treating.” Lebo Khumalo, secretary of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa in Ekurhuleni, said the patient passed two security points to get to the nurse at about 6am. “Security guards were not at any of those points. The man also attacked a patient in the same ward and stole a cellphone,” she said.  She said the hospital had live monitors and a security centre. But it would appear the guards, who work for a private security company, weren’t doing their work. “We wish government would bring in permanent security people who know their jobs. The CEO of the hospital can’t do anything except to express shock because the service is commissioned from the central office through a tender system,” Khumalo said.  Kwara Kekana, a spokeswoman for Health MEC Bandile Masuku, said the incident was deeply regrettable and would be investigated. “No patient or staff member’s safety should ever be compromised at health facilities. We’ll engage all parties concerned to find a workable solution,” she said. People expressed their shock about the video on social media.
