ZULU king Goodwill Zwelithini has vowed to end xenophobic attacks in Gauteng. “I’ve asked Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi to communicate with izinduna in various hostels in Gauteng to prepare for an imbizo,” said Zwelithini on Saturday. PROTESTERS WALK AWAY FROM BUTHELEZI MID SPEECH! He was speaking at the reed dance at Enyokeni royal palace in Nongoma, northern KZN. He said he had been asked to help stop the attacks and looting of shops in Gauteng. “I’ll go there and stop these senseless attacks on foreigners,” he said. However, at Jules Park in Joburg yesterday, protesters walked away while Buthelezi was addressing them. ONE PERSON DEAD IN JOBURG CBD RIOTS Buthelezi had said: “Attacks on foreign people, looting of their things and burning of buildings shows hate. “As Africans, we’re making a joke of ourselves. It’s like we’ve forgotten they helped us during apartheid by keeping us in their countries.” Zwelithini lashed out at those saying foreigners are being attacked by Zulus. He was angered by Police Minister Bheki Cele, who had called for an imbizo without obtaining his permission. He said Cele, a commoner, had no powers and rights to call for an imbizo, and izinduna answer to the king. FREE FLIGHT FOR NIGERIANS WHO WANT TO LEAVE! Cele had announced last week that he’d hold an imbizo with residents of Jeppe Hostel in Joburg to discuss ways of ending attacks on foreigners. Police ministry spokeswoman Lirandzu Themba confirmed the imbizo was postponed after Cele’s consultation with the king. The xenophobic attacks started three weeks ago after a taxi driver was killed by a foreigner in Tshwane. The attacks quickly spread to Joburg and Ekurhuleni, where shops were looted and torched. According to police, almost 500 people have been arrested and seven died.
