HAVING gained experience in the Absa Premiership, Bokang Tlhone doesn’t see playing in the GladAfrica Championship as a downgrade. The 28-year-old wingback made his debut for Real Kings last weekend when they defeated Jomo Cosmos 2-1. He made his professional debut with Free State Stars, but he joined Bidvest Wits on a one-year deal last season. But he spent most of his spell with the Students on the sidelines as he struggled to break into Gavin Hunt’s starting line up with Bafana Bafana left-back Sifiso Hlanti being the preferred choice. The lack of game time saw him leave Wits to join Maritzburg United in January last year on another one-year deal. But he also failed to make an impact and was released to search for greener pastures. He has now surfaced at Kings where he is playing with another former Ea Lla Koto star Edward Manqele. Tlhone admitted that life has been tough since he left Stars. “It has not been a nice ride for me for the past couple of seasons, but what I have told myself is that I should keep my head held up high during this difficult time and not allow people to bring me down,” said Tlhone. “I have told myself that wherever I am I will double my effort with the aim of going back to the PSL. The player revealed that he still harbours ambitions of coming back to the elite league. He said: “The main aim for me is to work hard and go back to the PSL, that’s the main objective. I also told the other youngsters that we should not be happy to play in the NFD (GladAfrica). The place to be is in the PSL.” On Saturday, Kings visit Royal Eagles in a KwaZulu-Natal derby at Chatsworth Stadium (3pm).
