IMAGINE tiptoeing into a flooded toilet when you want to relieve yourself! And you have to pay R2 to use that very same public toilet.  These are some of the headaches Baragwanath Taxi Rank commuters in Soweto face when they have to use the toilets. Speaking to Daily Sun, Nontsikelelo Mkhize (58) said she didn’t use the toilets anymore. READ: PICS: BABSIE IS HOME AFTER YEARS IN THAI JAIL “I’d rather hold it until I get home. I can’t afford to swim just for a pee. The last time I used the toilet it was dark. The toilet keeper had to buy a candle,” she said. When the SunTeam checked the toilets, some had no lights, while others had no flushing water. “Imagine paying money, the next thing you must get water with a bucket to flush. This is unhygienic,” said commuter Thandiwe Sekgantsha. Taxi driver Siyabonga Zwane said they were forced to pee in the bush. “We can’t be swimming in water just to relieve ourselves. We pay these people. They should at least keep the toilets serviced.” A woman who collects payments from toilet users said they told their committee about the condition of the toilets. “When we complain that people are swimming in water when they use toilets, we’re told to do our jobs and bring the money. We’re meant to bring R100 a day, and if we don’t we’re in trouble,” she said. READ: MUVHANGO ACTOR TO BE LAID TO REST! The toilets are managed by a group of unemployed Soweto residents. A worker confirmed this to Daily Sun. “The group collects a R2 fee and we clean the toilets as job creation. The committee then collects money each day from those keeping the toilets at the rank.” A woman who heads the group pretended to be someone else when Daily Sun called her. “Sorry, I don’t know what you talking about,” she said. She then hung up. When called again, she insisted on being a different person.
