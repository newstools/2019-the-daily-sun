TWO South African boxing sensations Jackson “M3” Chauke and Luther “The Black Panther” Clay were crowned international champions on Thursday. Chauke and Clay, who were involved in the biggest championship fights of their careers, dethroned reigning champions in their own back yard. A South African flyweight champion out-boxed the Russian prospect Mekhdi Abdurashedov and wrestled away his World Boxing Council (WBC) international flyweight belt. While the United Kingdom-based South African native scored a unanimous points victory to give the defending World Boxing Organisation (WBO) Global welterweight champion Dario Morello his first defeat. It was a great night for local pugilist, who embarked on respective journeys to elevate their respective boxing. Hopefully their victories will open more golden fighting opportunities especially for Chauke, who did not attract big opportunities despite having a colourful amateur career and an impressive professional record. The 34 year-old former Olympian promised to make good use of the opportunity before travelling on foreign soil, and indeed live up to his promise. Chauke’s record improved to 18-1-1 while his counterpart dropped to 7-1-0. Clay, who is born Luthando Mthimkhulu, recorded 12 wins and a single lost and while opponent dropped to 15-1.
