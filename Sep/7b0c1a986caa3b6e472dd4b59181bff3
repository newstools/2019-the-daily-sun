ANOTHER coach has fallen. Zeca Marques was yesterday fired by Moroka Swallows management following the club’s poor start to the season. Marques only registered one win, one draw, with three defeats in five matches at the helm. The 58-year-old has now joined the likes of Cavin Johnson, Clinton Larsen and Lionel Soccoia, who were being sacked by AmaZulu, Chippa United and Black Leopards last week, respectively. Swallows chairman David Mogashoa told SunSport that he pulled the trigger on Marques as the club had become a joke in the GladAfrica Championship. Their 2-0 defeat to Steenberg United in Cape Town at the weekend was the last straw for Birds management to show Marques the door. Said Mogashoa: “We decided to part ways because results were not coming. “We can’t have a club of Swallows’ calibre down there and this is not what we invested for. I am putting a lot of hard cash on this club and it has become a joke.” Mogashoa was also not pleased with Marques system during their 3-2 win over Real Kings in Soweto a week ago. “I was there and I saw how the team played. You could see that they scrapped through and if we didn’t get a win, we could still be languishing at the bottom. Mogashoa revealed that former Kaizer Chiefs striker Fani Madida will take over the hot seat on a caretaker basis until they find the right candidate. “We need someone who will take the club forward,” he said. However, the mandate has now changed for the club following the setback. Explained Mogashoa: “Our mandate changes based on the five matches. We are no longer challenging for promotion to the PSL. Now our aim is to stabilise the team to ensure we stay in the league and we will take it from there onwards.”
