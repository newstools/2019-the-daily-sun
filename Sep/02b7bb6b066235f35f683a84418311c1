ALTHOUGH they didn’t win America’s Got Talent Show, Ndlovu Youth Choir still makes Mzansi proud. The choir hails from Limpopo and has been doing the nation proud throughout the competition. The winner of the 14th season of America's Got Talent was crowned earlier this morning in a live broadcast in the US at 17:00 PST (Thursday 02:00 – SA time). The choir has had a great run but failed to make the top 5 during finale results. The group tweeted: “Our @AGT journey may have come to an end but this is only the beginning. We are so excited for what lies ahead and we look forward to continuing sharing love, unity and above all hope. “The finale @AGT was the perfect ending to a journey that has changed our lives forever and shared a message of hope, unity and above all love with the world. Thank you ???? for opening your hearts to us. Your support inspires us and fills us with joy. “ Mzansi people, such as Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, are extremely proud of what the choir has achieved. AGT season 14 was won by Kodi Lee, a blind singer with autism.
