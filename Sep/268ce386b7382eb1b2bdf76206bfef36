ON WEDNESDAY, Khayelitsha Hospital in Cape Town opened a new 24-hour blood bank. The facility was launched by the provincial health department in partnership with the Western Cape Blood Service. Blood service CEO Greg Bellairs said 150 000 units of blood were donated every year. “We supply blood products throughout the Western Cape, and they’re issued by 24-hour staffed blood banks,” he said. “We have emergency blood fridges in every health care institution. “We’ve been exploring opening either in Mitchells Plain or Khayelitsha hospitals for a few years, because we wanted to establish blood banks where the trauma epidemic is the highest.” Bellairs said the new bank would enable patients to receive blood quicker and save lives. David Binza, a doctor at Khayelitsha Hospital, said: “Bringing the services closer to the people will save a lot of lives.” He urged people to donate blood. Resident Limise Mgonduka (48) said: “People are stabbed and shot in this area. We all know people who died from losing blood.”
