TO AVOID xenophobic attacks in rural areas, residents of KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga met with foreigners in the area. They voiced out their concerns at Zakheni High School, Zakheni Village, on Saturday. Councillor Andries Motene said the aim was to unite locals and foreigners. He said attacks on foreign-owned businesses should not happen again in the area. He said residents should come up with a solution to avoid attacks on and looting of businesses. “I decided to call a community gathering involving foreign businesspeople to discuss the matter and reach common ground,” said Motene. “We must realise that we benefit from their businesses. We want those who use their businesses to sell illegal drugs to stop. It’s destroying our community and it’s the main reason behind the violent attacks.” He said residents needed to partner with foreigners, and that foreign businesspeople must ensure their shops were not sources of crime. The foreigners told Daily Sun they hoped the meeting would yield good results so everyone could live in peace. Nigerian Emmanuel Ogbu said he was willing to agree to what the locals wanted. “We want to live better with our brothers and sisters,” Emmanuel told the People’s Paper. “We’re not happy with what’s happening in other parts of the country.” Residents said if drugs could be stopped, everyone would live in peace.
