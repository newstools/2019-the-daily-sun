RESIDENTS of Wololo squatter camp became homeless on Tuesday. Their shacks in Ntuzuma C section were demolished, apparently by security guards from eThekwini’s land invasion unit. Five shacks were demolished and the owners said they had no idea why they were singled out. Mlungisi Mthembu (35) said: “All the shacks they demolished had numbers on them. “It looks as if only shacks with numbers were demolished.” Mlungisi said the security guards went as far as beating and shooting at them with rubber bullets. “This is not fair. We didn’t resist,” he said. Mlungisi said they didn’t open cases. “The last time we did that, police didn’t help us with anything, so it’s pointless to open cases,” he said. Sipho Makhoba (43) said he lost everything during the demolition. “All our building materials were destroyed,” said Sipho. “Our groceries were scattered everywhere and there was a huge mix-up. “We have no shelter and food. We didn’t stay in the shacks by choice. “We previously were renting, but it became too expensive.” Residents said some shacks had been there since 2011, while others were a year old. They said recently built shacks were not demolished. But municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela told Daily Sun: “The city’s land invasion unit was asked to assist the provincial human settlements department with the removal or demolition of illegally built informal dwellings.” He referred the SunTeam’s queries to the department. Mayisela said instructions given to the land invasion unit guards were that only unoccupied structures were to be demolished.
