REIGNING International Boxing Organisation (IBO) cruiserweight champion Kevin “Two Guns” Lerena is winding up his punches for a knockout victory against Albanian veteran fighter Sefer “The Real Deal” Seferi.The two glove masters will share the ring in a sixth title defence at the Emperors Palace tomorrow night. This Golden Gloves Promotions fight is themed “Fist of steel” and surely the two fighters will produce the goods. “I truly believe this man is a tough competitor,” Lerena indicated. “He fought big men in the heavyweight division, now he comes down to cruiserweight. We are equally big men with different attributes.” Seferi has been competing at both heavyweight and cruiserweight divisions, and in his latest fight he drew level with Firat Arslan in November last year. It is interesting how tomorrow’s clash will pen out because the challenger has not lost in a cruiserweight contest. The 40-year-old Seferi boasts 23 wins, two defeats and a draw. He lost to former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury and Manuel Charr. Seferi said he agreed to this fight because he believes he will win: “Lerena is a good fighter, but he is still very young.” In the main supporting bout, which is also a draw card, undefeated rising stars – Jabulani Makhense and Marios Matamba – will unify their respective African titles. Makhense will put his World Boxing Association Pan African title while Matamba is expected to bring his International Boxing Federation Africa crown to the party.
