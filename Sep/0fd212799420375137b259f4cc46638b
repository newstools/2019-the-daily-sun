SHOPS belonging to foreigners at Burnwood squatter camp in Durban remained closed yesterday. About 100 spaza shop owners were escorted out of the area on Sunday. The foreigners had to leave after residents marched to Sydenham Police Station. They demanded the removal of some shopkeepers they claimed threatened to shoot them.  Resident Mthobisi Cele (45) said they were terrified of the foreigners.  “We no longer feel safe in our area because of them. I heard they decided to carry guns because they didn’t want to be robbed or attacked by locals. But no one is planning to attack them,” he said. Another resident said they went to the police station because they didn’t want to remove the foreigners themselves. “If we decided to do it ourselves, things might turn badly. “We wanted to prevent chaos. That’s why we involved the cops,” said the resident. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “The acting station commander and public order police spoke to the residents. “A search was conducted at the squatter camp and one unlicensed pistol and eight live rounds were recovered.”
