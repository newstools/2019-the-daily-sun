THE bruised body found dumped near a primary school in Gugulethu, Cape Town, on Friday morning was that of a 24-year-old mum of two. Activist group Ilitha Labantu spokesman Siyabulela Monakali said the woman’s grieving family were holding off on releasing her name to allow police to investigate. “The family are still traumatised by the incident,” said Monakali. The family identified her body at the mortuary on Tuesday. The woman previously lived in Langa. Her body was found covered with hard objects including a concrete slab next to a path at the end of a cul-de-suc. “The culprits threw things at her, seemingly to hide her identity,” Monakali told Daily Sun. The spot was covered in sand, seemingly to hide the bloodstains.  ANC Women’s League members prayed during a picket in the area on Monday. Ilitha Labantu held its prayer meeting the following day. A delegation including ministers visited the murdered woman’s family afterwards. Ilitha Labantu said it would help the family with counselling and support. ) Dr Olive Shisana, chairwoman of a special task team on gender-based violence, said a new strategy to address the scourge was at its final stages. – NEWS24
