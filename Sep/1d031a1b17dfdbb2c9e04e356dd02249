THE Mbhele family can’t remember the last time they walked around freely without turning their noses up. Kak water has been running through the yard for almost two years. The family from KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, are forced to stay indoors even on sunny days. They said after a sewage pipe burst, they were not helped by the eThekwini municipality despite reporting the problem several times. Thembelihle Mbhele (29) said the kak water goes underneath the house, through the foundation, and comes out in the front. “The water spills onto the road as well. We no longer sit outside because this makes us sick,” she said. The family’s four children were taken to a doctor with stomach aches and rashes because of the problem. “I’ve also been treated for an infection, which I got while cleaning the smelling water,” said Thembelihle. “We also fear the house will collapse as the water runs underneath it.” Thembelihle said they placed stones and wood near the kitchen to walk on. “We live under terrible conditions and don’t know what to do,” she said. She said her family wanted the municipality to attend to the matter urgently. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela told Daily Sun officials will attend to the problem urgently.
