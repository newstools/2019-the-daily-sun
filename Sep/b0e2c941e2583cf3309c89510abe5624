ROSINA Tromaya can’t speak or eat properly. Her ex-lover allegedly bit off her tongue! She now wants the man to pay for what he did.   The 34-year-old from Bapong in Mosetleng section, North West, told Daily Sun she was from a neighbour’s when the incident happened three weeks ago. “My current boyfriend was in our house as he didn’t want to chill. “As I crossed the street going home, my ex called me,” she said. But she refused. She said he kept telling her that he missed her. Rosina said she kept on walking and he followed her.

He didn’t let go of the tongue until it was cut. “He then spat it out. My boyfriend heard the screams and came out. That’s when my ex ran away,” she said. Rosina said she went to hospital. A doctor told her it was too late to stitch the tongue back. “Now I can’t talk properly. What irritates me the most is that he was arrested for a day and then released. I want him arrested for good because the damage he caused will stay with me forever,” said Rosina. Her sister Ceskia (29) said: “She cries every day. The kids are traumatised because they can’t understand their mum when she speaks to them. She can’t even eat properly. It’s very bad.” She said she wanted the suspect arrested.
