RESIDENTS of Hostel One in Mangaung are furious over a burst pipe. They told Daily Sun the water was flowing and flooding their yards. Bathobakae Ngatane said the situation was so bad that it became difficult to enter or leave his house. “I tried to put planks and bricks, but the water washed away my temporary bridge. It has been two weeks now. We reported the matter to the municipality last week, but no one came,” he said.  “We spent over five hours scooping water out of the yard as it kept streaming in. My bed was floating in a river of water.” Residents said the water had been running since last week, and it was shameful in a province experiencing drought. Mampho Sebetsa (55) said: “On Monday, we went to their office to report it and they did not come. “Sometimes we wake up and start scooping water with buckets. We have to keep our kids indoors as they might drown. Every month there’s a burst pipe. The pipes are old and they must be replaced. We’re tired of living like fish.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said he wasn’t aware of the matter, but workers would be sent to fix it.
