THE Labour
Court has banned banking union Sasbo from going ahead with the banking sector
strike. According to the Labour Court the proposed action is
unlawful. SASBO had planned to bring the banking sector to its knees,
with more than 50 000 workers in the banking sector planning to go on strike
citing retrenchments in the industry. The union previously said that it is principally and
fundamentally opposed to job losses and retrenchments in the industry. SASBO says it is concerned about the high levels of
unemployment (29%) and the state of the economy.
