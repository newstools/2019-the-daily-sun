FORMER Kazier Chiefs veteran midfielder Reneilwe "Yeye" Letsholonyane has joined Highlands Park on a one year deal. Letsholonyane was a free agent after he was released by SuperSport United at the end of last season. He has been training with coach Owen da Gama's side for several weeks and he has finally signed on the dotted, the club confirmed on their official twitter account. “I’d love to have him, his football brain is just unbelievable.
You need that intelligence that creates the spark in the midfield. I think he
will definitely add value," Da Gama previously said about Letsholonyane. "He is also the most humble player I’ve seen in my life, a
God fearing boy, clean living so he could be a great example to all these boys about
how to live their lives and have longevity in their careers. Once you surround
yourself with quality people then you become a quality person."  The 37-year-old could make his debut for the Tembisa based outfit next Wednesday when they host Orlando Pirates at Makhulong Stadium, (7:30pm)
