SECHABA Moloi embodies the spirit of never giving up. His first marriage to Lerato (Tema Sebopedi) ended bitterly. And thanks to his never-say-die attitude, Sechaba is gearing himself to walk down the aisle again. This time with Phindi (Simphiwe Ngema).  According to Motlatsi Mafatshe, who plays Sechaba in the flagship SABC3 soapie Isidingo, Phindi is a great fit for his character. This as she’s calm, educated and brings out the best in Sechaba, “which makes him love her more”. Said Motlatsi: “She brings out Sechaba’s masculinity, which is something that draws him to her. “Sechaba is a guy who follows his heart and this is what he did this time as well.” Motlatsi said he believed Sechaba’s marriage would work this time around, as there are no outside influences like family. “This time it’s just Sechaba and Phindi. There are no families to get in the way of their marriage,” he said. “Lerato and Sechaba’s marriage crumbled because she was a straatmate and had cheated on him, so naturally they outgrew each other.” According to the actor, Sechaba’s wedding is scheduled to take place next month, but will only air between December and January, and will be a glamorous affair the show’s viewers will love.
