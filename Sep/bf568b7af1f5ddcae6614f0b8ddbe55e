KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has found himself in hot water with the club manager Bobby Motaung after the comments he made about Khama Billiat’s national team call-up. Middendorp was not impressed that the player opted to play for Zimbabwe in a World Cup qualifier after just returning from injury instead of using the Fifa break to recover. BILLIAT ANGERS MIDDENDORP The coach questioned how a player who could barely finish the full 90 minutes in the club last two Absa Premiership matches was now able to be the hero for his national team. He went far as suggesting that the star striker had made the decision to play for his country himself. Looks like the comment did not sit well with Motaung who said Middendorp’s comments were reckless. Talking to Soccer Laduma Website at the launch of the Shell Helix Ultra Cup on Friday midday Motaung stated: “I wasn’t there yesterday unfortunately, but the coach knows the rules of the club and international call-ups," "I don’t know why he raised that issue. Even if a player is injured he has got to report to camp.” Billiat had initially been left out of the first leg of the Warriors’ clash away to Somalia where they lost 1-0. But he made a surprise comeback for the return match despite a Chiefs statement that the player had suffered an injury in a league game away to Cape Town City on 27 August. Billiat was an instant hero when he scored in the dying minutes of the match to help his country Zimbabwe overcome Somalia 3-1 to progress to the next round of the World Cup qualifiers. “If the doctors in camp also do their assessments, based on our reports, they then make the call,” Motaung told the website. "I think it was uncalled for that the coach made that statement and we will deal with the matter internally.”
