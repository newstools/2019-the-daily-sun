REIGNING International Boxing Organisation (IBO) cruiserweight champion Kevin “Two Guns” Lerena wants to become the unified world champion. But first he wants to take a break after his third round technical knockout victory against an ageing Sefer Seferi at Emperors Palace on Saturday night. Lerena promised to send the challenger packing and the youthful champion lived up to his pre-fight promise. Now the 27-year-old southpaw intends to take a well-deserved rest after a busy year with three fights in 2019. His victory against a seasoned pugilist earned the South African fighter an IBO diamond ring. Talking about his stunning performance, the hard-hitting fighter said he wanted to send a strong message to cruiserweight contenders. “With that performance I wanted to make a statement that I’m here to stay in this division and cement myself and become the unified cruiserweight champion. I was in the best shape ever.” He will be meeting with his team, promoter Rodney Berman and trainer Peter Smith to determine where he will go from here. Said Lerena: “I really want a bit of a break. However, On Monday I will meet with Rodney and Smith and talk about the next step. I don’t know when I will be fighting again, it can be November or next year.” Lerena won the then vacant IBO cruiserweight belt on a split decision against French based Congolese Youri Kayembre in a hard fought encounter at the same venue in September 2017. He went on to made successful defences against Dmytro Kucher, Roman Golovashchenko, Artur Mann and Vasil Ducar. On the main supporting bill the unbeaten junior welterweight prospect Jabulani Makhense gave Marios Matamba his first defeat in a winner takes all championship contest. Makhense, the World Boxing Association Pan African champion unified the crown. Matamba held IBF Africa belt. Meanwhile, up and coming cruiserweight Lebo Moshitoa outpointed Keaton Gomes to claim the Gauteng provincial cruiserweight belt.
