ALL she ever wanted to do was to dance. She never thought that one day she’d be an actress. Zonke Mchunu (27) from Maphumulo village in Stanger, KZN said it was impossible for her to dance because there were few opportunities in her village. “I used to watch Jika Majika and Sarafina so that I could dance like them,” said Zonke. After matric Zonke went to Durban University of Technology to study theatre and drama. “I never missed the dance classes. It was like therapy. I was far away from home, but it comforted me and helped escape my loneliness,” she said. Zonke said her course included scriptwriting, theatre make-up and music. “This allowed me to learn to communicate with the public. I was a shy person and through it I had a voice and learnt to accept who I am.” Zonke got her first acting job as an extra on Uzalo a few years ago. “I was part of the choir and my role lasted under 10 seconds but I was on television. It was the most overwhelming moment of my life,” she said. Zonke said she then attended acting workshops run by Duma Ka Ndlovu for more than a year. “This is where I went deep into acting and auditioned for Muvhango,” she said. “Today, I play Imani Nkosi who started as a young sweet girl from KZN who came to Joburg to study and work. ) Muvhango airs on SABC 2 weekdays at 9pm
