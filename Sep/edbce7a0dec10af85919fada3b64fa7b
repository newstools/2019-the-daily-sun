LUNGILE Xolo is a very worried mum. The 49-year-old from Margate, in the KZN South Coast, said her daughter Sammy Mqadi (24) went missing on Friday. She lived in a rented room in Umlazi AA section, south of Durban. Sammy was last seen wearing blue denim jeans, white T-shirt, white jersey and navy sandals. She and her friends were allegedly at a tavern, but she refused to leave with them. She apparently never returned to her rented room. Lungile told Daily Sun she was contacted by her daughter’s friend about Sammy’s disappearance. She said the friends told her they searched for her with no luck, and reported her disappearance to the cops. “I also searched for her in our area, at relatives, mortuaries and hospitals, but there was no sign of her. This is really breaking me because she wasn’t someone who’d leave home without telling anyone,” she said. “Hearing stories of women being killed by men makes me worry even more.” Lungile said Sammy lived in Umlazi as she did in-service training in the administration department at Sishosonke High School. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “Anyone with information about her whereabouts should call 08600 10111.”
