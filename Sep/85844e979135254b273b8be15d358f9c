KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp and SuperSport United striker Bradley Grobler have won the Absa Premiership monthly awards for August. Middendorp bagged the Coach of the Month accolade after guiding his charges to three wins and a draw during the first four matches of the season. It is the German's first time on the podium for this particular accolade since arriving back at Naturena in December last year, having made a stunning turn around from after a poor ending to the 2018/19 campaign. SuperSport striker Bradley Grobler, won the best player of the first month of the season after scoring four goals and an assist in the four first games. It is also a first for Grobler, who has had his fair share of injury struggles in recent seasons.
