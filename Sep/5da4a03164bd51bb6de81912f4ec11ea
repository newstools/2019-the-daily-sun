 FORMER president Thabo Mbeki has described late former
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe as a fellow combatant who helped South Africans to
achieve true independence. Mbeki was addressing Mugabe memorial service at city hall in
Durban on Tuesday. He said there are people who are portraying Mugabe as bad
person and those people do not know the role he played in solving African
problems. Mbeki said the whole of Africa especially Southern African
countries should be grateful to Mugabe. He said Mugabe started his political activism in the ANC
youth league while he was a student at Fort Hare University in Eastern Cape in
1950s. He said it was important for the country to hold his memorial service. He said Mugabe was part
of African revolution from the beginning until his death. He said he led a delegation of Zanu-PF to see ANC in Zambia
in 1978. He said the meeting
well and Mugabe said his party wanted to work with the ANC and asked Umkhonto
wesizwe units to join Zimbabwe liberation army to fight apartheid together. He said it was important to pay tribute to Mugabe for the
role he played to help South Africa with smooth transition to democracy. He said Zimbabwe Defence Force moved to the banks of Limpopo
river to stop South African Defence Force from getting into Zambia to attack
ANC. He said at some stage
he issued ANC members with Zimbabwe passport so that they move freely. In 1989 ANC decided
to negotiate to apartheid government for peace and democracy.
