BAFANA Bafana and Bidvest Wits captain Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo and Springboks loose forward and captain Siya Kolisi can be easily mistaken as being brothers. The hard as rock Hlatshwayo is no nonsense defender always gives attacking players tough time on the pitch stopping them from scoring goals. He currently lead Bafana to the quarter finals on the Africa Cup of nations which was held in Egypt. On the other end, Kolisi will become the first black African to captain the Boks at a World Cup when the team begins its campaign in Japan on 21 September. The humble flank grew up on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth in Zwide and had to fight for a chance to play professional rugby. @BafanaBafana skipper Thulani Hlatshwayo wishing his @Springboks counterpart, Siya Kolisi all the best against All Blacks today pic.twitter.com/elslDkh09N
