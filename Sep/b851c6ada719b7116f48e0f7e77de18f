Around 1 000 community
members reclaimed Sunnyside’s streets during a march on Friday night. The march, which
started and ended in Jubilee Square, aimed to raise awareness of gender-based
violence as well as address community issues such as drug abuse and crime. In attendance were
Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Safety and Security MEC Faith Mazibuko‏. During his address to
the crowd, captured on social media, Makhura said: “We must reclaim our
streets… Day and night it must be safe for all the women of our country. We are
not going to allow criminals to scare our people into their homes.” Ward councillor
Godfrey Mulaudzi says the group walked to areas known for crime and sex work,
ending at Gerard Moerdyk Street. The street is home to a notorious crime
hotspot, an abandoned building dubbed "the White House" by locals. Although many crimes
are fuelled by alleged drug activity at this site, says Mulaudzi, the march
also aimed to address community-wide issues such as drug abuse and domestic
violence.    SOURCE: NEWS24
