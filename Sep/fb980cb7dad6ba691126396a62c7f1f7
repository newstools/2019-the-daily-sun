STRUGGLING GladAfrica Championship outfit Free State Stars have appointed Vladislav Heric as their new coach. Heric replaces long time Ea Lla Koto stalwart, Themba Sithole who will remain at the club as his assistant. Sithole has been at Stars for many years in various roles. Stars were relegated at the end of last season and find themselves battling in the second tier and are winless from their three league matches played so far this season. Ea Lla Koto management are hoping that Heric’s experience in local soccer will help them move up the table and regain their place in the top flight. But the Serbian born coach has mixed fortunes in Mzansi. He has coached in the Premier Soccer League at Black Leopards, Polokwane City, Chippa United and Maritzburg United. The Serbian born mentor has also coached in the National First Division (NFD) which has now been rebranded as the GladAfrica Championship. However, he was in charge of NFD club Ubuntu Cape Town last season when they were relegated to the ABC Motsepe League. Stars general manager Rantsi Mokoena confirmed the appointment of his club’s new coach. He told SunSport yesterday: “Yes, Heric is the new coach of the club.” According to our sources, the Serbian coach has been handed a two-year contract. Heric’s immediate target to Stars is to change the club’s fortunes around. The Bethlehem-based outfit’s opening three games have produced a single point, they have lost two and drawn the other, lying 13th in the table. Ea Lla Koto were relegated, just a year after they won the Nedbank Cup in the 2017-18 season. The well travelled coach whose CV also includes NFD clubs such as Royal Eagles, African Warriors, FC Cape Town and Cape Town All Stars will lead his new side for the first time against TS Sporting at Goble Park on Saturday.
