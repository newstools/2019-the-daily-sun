Tshwane cops have arrested a man after he threatened to bomb the Menlyn Maine Shopping Centre. The man allegedly made bomb threats at the shopping centre in the East of Pretoria. Police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach told Daily Sun that at around 11:15 an unknown man in his fifties entered a bank at the Menlyn Maine Shopping Centre. Weilbach said the man handed a note over to the bank teller who assisted him. “The note contained a threat to say that there is a bomb planted inside the bank,” Weilbach said.   The security immediately reacted and evacuated the whole shopping centre.   The SAPS responded and arrested the man inside the bank and a firearm was confiscated. “The SAPS bomb disposal and K9 units were called out and are still on the scene to inspect a device that was found. The shopping center is not declared as safe yet,” Weilbach added. The man will be charged with contravention of the Explosive Act No 26 of 1956 for making a false threat. According to Weilbach he will appear in the Hatfield Community Court soon.
