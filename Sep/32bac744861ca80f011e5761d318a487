MASKANDI star Sbusiso “Bahubhe” Mkhize and Durban inyanga, Andile “Mzimbokhalimali” Dlamini, are locked in a war of words. At the heart of their fight is the song, Goduka Ndoda, by the award-winning Bahubhe. The song is in Bahubhe’s latest album, Solve for X.  Part of the lyrics, translated to English read: Go home because you’re now useless. You’ve been abusing people, promising them nothing but now you’ve become sick and a burden to those around you. We trusted you, hoping you’d change our lives but you exploited us.  Mzimbokhalimali believes the winner of the Best Maskandi Newcomer category in the South African Traditional Music Awards wrote the song to shame him. Fumed inyanga: “I made Bahubhe. Today, he’s counted among the maskandi stars because of me.  “When I met him he was hungry, poor and had no car or decent accommodation. I cleaned him up and made him a superstar. “Today, he thinks he’s better than me. He thinks he has made it in life.” Mzimbokhalimali, who’s always dressed in R100 and R200 notes, said Bahubhe’s song targets him. “This song is directed at me because we aren’t friends and everyone knows this,” he said. “What saddens me is that I helped him build his career. But today he disrespects me like this.” Responded Bahubhe: “When I wrote the song I knew it would offend people, including Mzimbokhalimali. It was my intention to hit a nerve.” Bahubhe said Mzimbokhalimali had no right to claim credit for his success. “Mzimbokhalimali and his team have been badmouthing me and I’m sick of it. “He’s a liar! He never helped me, instead I worked hard to get recognition in the industry.” Bahubhe said Mzimbokhalimali and him were competing. “My problems with him started at a function he hosted last year. He realised I had more fans and didn’t like this at all.”
