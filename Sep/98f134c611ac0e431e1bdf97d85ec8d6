UNIVERSITY of Zululand students brought the KwaDlangezwa area to a standstill yesterday. They staged a protest before blocking the R102 road and N2 freeway. They demanded implementation of measures to ensure their safety outside campus. Sasco secretary at the university, Siya Mthethwa, said students were tired of being mugged at their residences. He said residences were owned by a few locals who built them after seeing that the university was admitting a large number of students. “Students are not safe at these residences,” said Mthethwa.  “They’re mugged by thugs who demand their cellphones and laptops at gunpoint. “It looks as if the landlords don’t care. “They only care about getting rent money at the end of the month and not the safety of students.” He said their protest was fuelled by what happened on Thursday.  “A male student was shot during a robbery and his cellphone and laptop were taken. “He’s in hospital fighting for his life,” he said. Mthethwa suggested that the university outsource the flats in Empangeni CBD and use them to accommodate students. “The university can hire a security company that will offer security services 24 hours a day at the flats,” he said.  KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a group of students blocked the R102 with tyres, trees and stones. “Public order police and Mtunzini police are at the scene to monitor the situation,” said Gwala. UniZulu spokeswoman Gcina Nhleko-Mdluli condemned the attacks on students.
