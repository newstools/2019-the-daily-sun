Growing interest in renting even everyday clothing such as jeans and athletic wear is drawing mall retailers from Urban Outfitters, to NYC&Co, to Bloomingdale’s, to experiment with selling apparel rental subscriptions. BBC reported earlier this year that Urban Outfitters Inc is set to rent out clothing and it looks like more retailers are hoping on to the bandwagon. The retailer is launched an online subscription service allowing people to borrow six items to wear for a month before swapping them. The firm says that in terms of clothing, millennials in particular want variety and sustainability.
