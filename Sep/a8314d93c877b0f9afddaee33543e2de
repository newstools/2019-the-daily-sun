Holding on the phone to speak to a bank consultant to take your call can be a daunting task, because not only does this waste your time, but it can also be frustrating. So, it's no wonder that Rhythm City actress Samkelo Ndlovu took on her bank FNB for poor service. The star expressed her fury on her Twitter account, saying she is changing banks, because of the consultants' ineptitude. The frustrated actress wrote: "I am changing banks immediately!!!! F*ck @FNBSA and their consultants that just aren’t willing to help. Spent all morning on the phone to be told sh*t like “it’s missing money” ??? I wish we had more and better banks".
