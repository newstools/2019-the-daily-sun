THE record-breaking Bugatti Chiron ‘Longtail’ has been confirmed to go into production by 2021 and it will be dubbed the Super Sport 300+. The Chiron Super Sport 300+ will be exactly similar to the prototype that broke the 490.484 kph speed record. It will have the menacing body made out of carbon fiber and orange stripes similar to the Veyron SS WRE. The Super Sport 300+ will utilise Volkswagen’s quad-turbo 8.0-liter W16 engine pushing out a horrific 1,578 horsepower.  The difference between the two cars is that the 300+ will not have a roll cage but will have a speed limiter in order to prevent the owners from trying to clock the 490.484 kph on national roads. Bugatti president Stephan Winkelmann told Motor1.com that the limited run 30 production cars will top out at 440 kph (273 mph).  However, according to TopGear, buyers will be able to add the roll cage and ditch the speed limiter to try and replicate the Longtail’s performance. Bugatti will grant customers access to the track where there’s a 5.4-mile (8.7-km) long straight.
