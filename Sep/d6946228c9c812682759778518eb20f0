SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD climate change activist Greta Thunberg has told politicians they are not doing enough to combat the phenomenon. “I know you’re trying but just not hard enough. Sorry,” said the Swedish pupil who has inspired many people across the world to protest against global warming. She’s also inspired the formation of a movement known as the Extinction Rebellion. The BBC reported Thunberg was one of young activists from around the world invited to address the Senate Climate Change Task Force in Washington, US, during two days of action and speeches. If the task force thought she’d be honoured just to be there, it was mistaken. “Save your praise,”she told the assembly yesterday. “Don’t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it.” Instead of submitting a personal statement, as is usual before a hearing, she sent Congress a major report on global warming, along with eight sentences of her own. “I’m submitting this report as my testimony because I don’t want you to listen to me,” she said. “I want you to listen to the scientists. And I want you to unite behind the science. And then I want you to take action.” This came on the eve of a global climate strike tomorrow. About 4 638 planned events will take place in 139 countries. Action is planned for Joburg and Cape Town. – SUNREPORTER
