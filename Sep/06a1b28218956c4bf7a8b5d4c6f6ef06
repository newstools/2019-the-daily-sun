THOUSANDS of activists took to the streets in large cities on Saturday to demand safe and legal abortions. The protests on International Safe Abortion Day came after the Mexican state of Oaxaca on Wednesday approved a bill to legalise abortion, making it only the second region after Mexico City to permit the procedure. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador earlier this month sent a bill to the federal Congress that, if approved, grant amnesty to women serving jail terms for what is considered a crime in all states, except in Oaxaca and the capital. Congress is dominated by his leftist National Regeneration Movement, although MPs from different parties have signalled they would support the bill. Mexico is a predominantly conservative and Roman Catholic country, and the president himself has avoided taking a clear stand on the matter. Mexico City legalised abortion in 2007. Hundreds of people took to the streets in the capital. Local television stations also showed footage of protests in the states of Aguascalientes, Jalisco, Oaxaca and Veracruz. “When a woman decides to have an abortion, she makes an intimate and profound decision,” wrote former presidential candidate Patricia Mercado on Twitter. Mercado has also promoted a bill to ban gay conversion therapy in Mexico. She also said government also had an obligation to provide safe health services to women. – REUTERS
