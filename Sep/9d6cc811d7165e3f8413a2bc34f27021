PASTOR Kenny Ramahala needs more than a crowd at his church. The House of Fellowship Christian Church in Mqantsa Section, Tembisa, in Ekurhuleni, pastor last Sunday preached about commitment. “Commitment brings unity in the church. Once we’re committed to the same vision, we’ll become unified, said the pastor. Pastor Kenny said it is a common knowledge that some churches are suffering from split. “Jesus had 12 disciples and even after one betrayed Him, 11 remained committed. This is a challenge in a number of churches. Commitment channels people to seek to understand and know God.” The 45-year-old pastor from GaMaphalle, Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo, said serving God was not attached to material things. “Some of today’s churches only focus on material things. Everybody wants that and it is good to have that. However, We mustn’t deviate from the message of God,” he said. Kenny said we need to preach Christ crucified. “The Bible says seek the kingdom of God first then all the things we need will be given to us. Prosperity, success and deliverance will be added unto us. It is advisable to seek God who is the giver of all these things. The commitment is to focus on following Christ and do the work of God. Without complains knowing that Christ will reward you of what you are doing. This will build stewardship in the church,” said Kenny. The pastor said Christ didn’t mind a big following, but needed more than a following. “He needed commitment. And commitment requires emotion and action because it is not easy as we think about following Jesus.  He wanted people to understand that there’s a prize to pay. It is a state of quality of being dedicated to the cause. Sometimes it takes your time because of the agreement you made.  When you receive Christ, you’re alone and it’s personal. Not for the masses.”
