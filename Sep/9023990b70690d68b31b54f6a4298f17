 IT'S been a jam-packed couple of days for Miss South Africa, Zozibini Tunzi, in New York so far. The beauty queen, who landed in the Big Apple just ahead of Fashion Week, has walked the runway at a Laduma Ngxokolo showcase, and spent some time at the South African consulate. Zozibini also had the chance to meet fellow Miss Universe contender Miss USA, Cheslie Kryst. "It was such an honor meeting @chesliekryst. Such a phenomenal woman! Can't wait to spend more time with her and other @missuniverse sisters at Miss Universe [sic]," she wrote. It was such an honor meeting @chesliekryst. Such a phenomenal woman!
