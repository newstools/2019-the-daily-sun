A video of an Ekurhuleni metro police officer seemingly drunk on duty has gone viral on social media. In the video, the drunk cop can be seen raising his hands and holding a box of cigarettes. The disorientated metro cop then continues walking to the state car while having an argument with a member of the public. The member of the public can then be heard saying: “You shouldn’t be driving because you are under the influence of alcohol.” The cop then questions the man who said he shouldn’t drive whether he has tested him.  Executive Mayor of the City of Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina Tweeted saying: “People of SA, I have seen the video of the drunk Metro Police and be rest assured relevant authorities in the administration are handling the matter and will accordingly report. I know it’s a matter of public interest so will share the ACTION taken.” Masina further Tweeted that the police chief Major General Isaac Mapiyeye has followed due processes and has decided to suspend both the drunk Metro Officer and his Supervisor after considering other factors. “I urge the public to give them space to conclude on this matter. Metro will give further detail,” Masina said in his tweet. It is not clear when and where the incident took place.
