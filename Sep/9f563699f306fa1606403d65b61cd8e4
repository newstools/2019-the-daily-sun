VICTIMS of xenophobic attacks apparently slept on steel tables at Tsolo Hall in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. That was to avoid sleeping on the floor. More than 100 people, who were victims of attacks at the Mandela squatter camp recently, were still at the hall. Grecian Gomani (38) from Malawi said he couldn’t wait to go back home. But transport to take him back to his native country would only be available tomorrow. He said there was nothing left for him in Mzansi as everything he owned was burnt down during the attacks. “I don’t know what I’m going to do when I get home, but I’m saving my life by leaving,” he said. Grecian said the situation at the hall was not the best, but was better than being in bushes, where they first escaped. Detailing the living conditions at the hall, he said some slept on the floor. Those with small children were prioritised and given foam mattresses. He said if it weren’t for the donated blankets, it would’ve been difficult to sleep directly on the floor. On Thursday, five buses left Katlehong heading to Mozambique and Zimbabwe. However, the buses were not full as some people opted to stay in Mzansi hoping to be integrated into communities. But others had different reasons. A Zimbabwean woman (41) said she couldn’t leave as her kids were still writing their exams. She said she would have to wait until they were done and hopefully leave around December. But Hazel Jestinah said poverty would force people who were sent back home to come back to Mzansi. “Not all of them have accommodation back home as they left long ago,” she said. Hazel said it would be better if the South African government and other countries had plans for those who were sent home. Hazel agreed that some victims of xenophobic attacks were involved in crimes such as dealing in drugs, which formed part of what started the attacks.
