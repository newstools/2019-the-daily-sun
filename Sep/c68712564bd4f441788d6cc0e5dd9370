If you consume alcohol, you might have had your fair share of the near death feeling that comes with a hangover. That pounding headache and stomach-churning nausea are a result of a lot of alcohol taken in quickly and it takes many hours for your liver to process it out of your system hence you would feel sick. Hangovers and their unpleasant symptoms have been deemed a legitimate illness by a German court, CNN reported.  Judges said an illness should be defined in the interest of protecting people’s health and any or even a slight or temporary disruption of the body’s normal condition or normal activity is an illness and that includes headaches and other symptoms that result from consuming alcohol. Alcohol seriously affects the drinker’s ability to work, the decisions they make, their driving skills and it could also put their colleagues in danger. “When hung over, your body hurts from inflammation, your heart is put under strain as the effects of anxiety are heightened, endorphins crash and dehydration sets in. Alcohol also affects your stomach so it loses its ability to absorb minerals and vitamins for a period of time,” said Rhys Evans, director at Alco-Safe.
