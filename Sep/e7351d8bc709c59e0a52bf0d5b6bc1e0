Termination of pregnancy is when a woman decides to end her pregnancy by medical means before the full term. The woman must be under 13 weeks pregnant to end the pregnancy without giving reasons. If she is between 13 and 20 weeks pregnant, the pregnancy may be terminated only under specific conditions. If she is more than 20 weeks pregnant, it will be done only if her or the foetusâ€™ life is in danger or there are likely to be serious birth defects. Source: www.gov.za
