 THE AmaNdebele want recognition and they want it now! They want their Chief Leka Kekana to be officially recognised and issued with a certificate. Wearing their traditional attire, they took to the streets of Tshwane on Wednesday to voice out their grievances. They later headed to the Union Buildings to hand over a memorandum to the Presidency. When they got to the Union Buildings gates, they praised their king, recited clan names and ululated. With placards addressed at President Cyril Ramaphosa, the group from Hammanskraal and Soshanguve, sang traditional songs.  The chief’s secretary, Jones Mabitsela, said they could no longer be patient with government. He said they sent every document government has asked for, yet they are still not recognised. “Our chief is a legitimate chief of the Matebele, a Moletlane. He is royal through and through and we demand he be respected,” he said. He said government should speed up the process of recognising Kekana. “He has to be given a certificate. Why is there a delay to recognise our traditional leader? “The chief’s subjects feel their chief is not being treated fairly like other traditional leaders,” said Mabitsela.  He said the delay in recognising the chief impacted his authority. “There are issues his subjects want him to rule on, but he cannot because of recognition. It’s difficult for him to sit and mobilise with other chiefs,” he said. Matlakala Moletlane (45) said her chief helped his subjects even though he has not been recognised. “We go to him with a lot of our problems and he is always willing to help us.  “He is a wise man and educated on a lot of matters. Our tribe’s lives will change for the better if he is recognised,” she said. The presidency’s Kelvin Humble received the memorandum and promised to get back to the group.
