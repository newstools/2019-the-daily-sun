Facebook has followed Instagram by scrapping its like
count due to mental health concerns. Australia is the first country to trial the changes,
which will be rolled out on Friday. According to Daily Mail the social media giant has acted after mental health
experts said the like function can cause huge stress.  Users will still be able to see how many likes their
posts receive, but others will not. This is the same change that was made
by Instagram. A Facebook spokesman told Daily Mail Australia they
wanted to help improve user wellbeing and reduce anxiety. 'We want people to feel comfortable expressing themselves
on the platform, as opposed to focusing on the number of Likes and reactions
something receives.' 'You'll still have the ability to see how many reactions
your posts receive by tapping into the comments, but others won't have the
ability to see the total numbers. 'Likewise, you won't have the ability to see how many
Likes or reactions other posts receive. We wanted to test this with a digitally
savvy audience that has a thriving community on Facebook, which is why we're
starting with Australia. 'After we review the results we'll analyse whether we
might expand this to other markets.' The move comes just months after Instagram began hiding
'likes' in Australia and Canada on a trial basis and if successful it will
be expanding the changes worldwide. Instagram removed its like count to take the pressure off
users and create a positive environment. Instagram's decision to hide likes sparked controversy in
July, with a number of influencers expressing outrage over the changes.
