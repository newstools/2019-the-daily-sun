 DRAMA seems to be following 23-year-old Mpumalanga tycoon, Sam Chabalala. This comes after his company’s manager, was allegedly shot and killed on Thursday night. The man who is in his twenties allegedly had evidence wanted by the Hawks regarding Chabalala's case. It is reported he was shot eight times while at one of Chabalala's truck depots in Bethal.  Bethal police spokesman, Constable Thomas Mogadime confirmed to Daily Sun that a man was shot and killed last night. "We received information about murder at Sam Holdings. Police attended to it and on arrival they found the general manager lying in a pool of blood. Currently police are still busy with investigations," he said. Chabalala popularly known as ‘Mshengu' made headlines when he flashed his convoy of his expensive cars while making their way to this year’s Durban July event. He was arrested last week Friday at an eatery in Highveld Mall after he alleged tried to bribe Home Affairs officials with R40 000 to destroy reports of his fraudulently obtained South African ID. Chabalala who is facing corruption, fraud, contravention of immigration act, unlicensed firearm and ammunition charges is expected to appear at the Witbank Magistrated Court today for his formal bail application.
