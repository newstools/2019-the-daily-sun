THE family of a four-year-old rape victim hopes the police will do the right thing. This comes after the girl was raped, allegedly by her mkhulu, on Thursday. Her gogo (56) told Daily Sun  her granddaughter told her on Friday her vagina was sore. “I checked and saw a yellowish discharge coming from her vagina,” said the gogo. She said she asked a relative to take the girl to a clinic. “The nurses confirmed she was raped. The relative reported the matter to the cops following a nurse’s advice,” said the gogo. Gogo said cops took statements, and that’s when the girl accused mkhulu of raping her. “I’m confused because the relative said she never left my granddaughter with mkhulu,” said the gogo. She said they were waiting for DNA results so they would know for sure if the mkhulu raped the girl. “I plead with the police to continue investigating. My granddaughter was raped and for that we want justice,” said the gogo. In a WhatsApp conversation, the father of the girl, who is overseas, said he was heartbroken and wanted justice for his daughter. KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza sent a team of social workers to visit the family. The team will provide counselling and look for ways to remove the girl from that situation. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A case of rape was opened at Nhlanhleni Police Station. “The docket was transferred to Dundee family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit for further investigation.”
