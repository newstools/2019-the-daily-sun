Audi’s awesome new A1 has arrived in Mzansi! Yes, the Audi A1 is now ready for round two and it looks sportier than ever before. It promises to be even more popular than the outgoing model, which found almost 14 000 homes since its launch in 2011. The new A1 is only available as a five-door. With its striking design, the latest A1 has grown significantly in length, with an additional 56mm and now measures 4,03 metres.  The width has remained almost the same at 1,74 metres, while its wide track and short overhangs provide for a taut, sporty look. The wide, low-placed grille and implied side air inlets dominate the distinctive front. Below the edge of the hood are three flat slit, a homage to the Sport quattro, the brand’s rally icon from 1984.  The newcomer is also available in a choice of 10 colours, while its roof can be optionally finished in a contrasting colour from the A-pillar to the roof edge spoiler. The new A1 is fit for the digital future as even the basic version comes standard with a fully digital instrument cluster with a high-resolution 8,8-inch display. The three engine derivatives to choose from too are the 30TFSI, 35TFSI and 40TFSI. Pricing kicks off at R359 900 for the 30 TFSI model.
