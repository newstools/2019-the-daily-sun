THE case against the man accused of killing Palesa Madiba is taking its toll on her family. This after yet another postponement yesterday in the Protea Magistrates Court, where murder accused Dumisani Mkhwanazi (36) appeared briefly. Madiba’s family were visibly frustrated by the postponement. Her aunt Tebogo Tsoledi told Daily Sun: “We’re frustrated by the postponements “They don’t sit well with us. It’s hard but we have to wait for the law to take its course.” Mkhwanazi should have been served with an indictment yesterday to go to the South Gauteng High Court. But the prosecutor requested a further postponement, saying the advocate in charge of the indictment document was on leave.  The matter was postponed to 14 October. Mkhwanazi faces charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. Madiba was last seen alive on 9 August 2013 while visiting her best friend Tshidi Mkhwanazi’s home in Phiri, Soweto. Madiba’s remains were found in a shallow grave at Tshidi’s home four years ago. The accused Mkhwanazi is Tshidi’s uncle.
