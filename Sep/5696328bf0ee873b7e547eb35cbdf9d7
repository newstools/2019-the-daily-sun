Minister of
Police Bheki Cele said his department has organised a march by male cops next
week. The
minister said this while addressing the portfolio committee on Police this morning,
but he didn’t disclose the venue of the march and its exact date. The march
will give female activists the chance to address the matters of women abuse and
how they should be handled. “We
discussed yesterday, and we have agreed to call the SAPS male march next week.
We are calling the South African male police officers and we want the women
activist to come and address them. What do you expect from the male police as
you enter the police station,” said Cele. He said he
has already spoken to some of the activists: “I have asked them to make sense
rather than to come and box the police and all that,” said Cele. He said the
engagement should be to enlighten male cops on how to handle women at the cop
shops. “Yes, we
train them in the college but the experience on the ground happenings is the
best one,” said Cele. The
minister said it is difficult for female victims to report rape to male cops
and his department has made efforts to ensure that women few comfortable in
reporting the cases. “You got
raped by a man an hour earlier and then you come and report graphically, how
you have been raped, it can’t. You end up saying ‘you know what, I’m leaving
this thing. I’m getting out’ so,
whatever we can do to make life easier for women taking these matters forward,
let it be,” added Cele.
