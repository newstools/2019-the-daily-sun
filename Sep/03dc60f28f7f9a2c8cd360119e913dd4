ACTRESS Nompilo Maphumulo has been showing her acting skills since starting her role as Nosipho Xulu on SABC1’s Uzalo. But the talented actress has discovered another talent. She has ventured into music, as she can sing and dance. Nompilo said she believes that an artist must be multitalented and be able to do anything related to art. “The sky’s the limit for me. I don’t want to be known only as an actress but as an artist who is able to do anything related to the arts,” said Nompilo. She will soon release a gqom song titled Sebenzel’ Imali, featuring Mzulu Majola., who shot to fame when he collaborated with rapper Zakwe. Nompilo said it has always been her dream to make her own music. “I love music, dancing and entertainment. I also love to be around vibrant people. “That’s why I chose to release a gqom song because it requires a person to be active and is easy to dance to,” said Nompilo. She hopes her music will be well-received by music lovers. “Times travel fast. Before we know it, it will be a festive season now and every artist have started to prepare for this season.“I’m certain that people will dance to my song this festive season.” The actress said music didn’t interfere with her acting job, as she makes time for both. “I’ve learnt to organise my time.” I’m able to manage time for my art work , friends and family. I am Nompilo who can multi-task,” she said.
