A FAMILY are still in shock after an attack in which a man died and three of his friends were injured. Six friends were relaxing on Monday outside a house in KwaMashu M section, north of Durban, when four armed men stormed the property and demanded a gun. When they could not get the gun they were looking for, one of them took out a gun and fired several shots, killing Lungani Majozi (29). Three of Lungani’s friends were injured in the attack. The men then stormed the house, pointed a gun at a gogo and another woman, and robbed them of their cellphones and cash. They ransacked the house and later fled on foot after apparently finding the gun. It was still not clear why they wanted the gun, or who the owner was. A resident (54) said Lungani was declared dead on the scene. “Lungani was visiting friends. They didn’t even fight the armed men,” he said. He said the family were still traumatised and concerned the men might come back. “The six friends were not bothering anyone. They were boozing when they were attacked,” said the resident. Cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery were being investigated by Ntuzuma police. No arrests had been made.
