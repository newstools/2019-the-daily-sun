ABOUT 500 women gathered at Hoffman Square in Bloemfontein on Monday to voice their anger over rape. The women said they couldn’t afford to see more rapeing happening in Mangaung. Free State ANC Women’s League chairwoman Mapaseka Nkoane said: “Women must be respected. We therefore appeal to President Cyril Ramaphosa to bring back the death penalty. “We’re sick and tired of the senseless killing of women happening in the country. We consider this picketing a warning shot. “If we’re not heard, we’ll close all the roads so our cries are heard.” Mangaung mayor Olly Mlamleli said women’s hearts were stained with blood. “We’re wearing black because our tears flow every day on our chins,” she said “Down with rapists and down with killers. We’re like the women who marched in 1956. “The pain of other women is your pain. We’re sending a message to the president that enough is enough! “We’re also sending a message to ANCWL president Bathabile Dlamini and the entire leadership that we want the death sentence discussed.”
