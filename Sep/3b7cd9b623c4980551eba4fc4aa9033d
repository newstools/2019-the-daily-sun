YOU’D expect Ernst Middendorp to be happy to see Khama Billiat more on the pitch than off it nursing injuries. But far from it. The Kaizer Chiefs has been angered by Billiat’s decision to travel to Zimbabwe for a recent Fifa World Cup qualifier. Billiat was substituted in a league match against Cape Town City with an injury and was expected to spent the Fifa international week in convalescence. But lo and behold, he rocked up at the National Sports Stadium in Harare where he scored a winner as Zimbabwe salvaged their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign with a 3-2 aggregate victory over Somalia last week. But it appears the Zimbabwean’s effort left Middendorp unimpressed. “I actually have my own idea in this direction and, ja, the player made his decision and that’s it,” said Middendorp  when quizzed on Billiat. “It’s not about being impressed (with his display). We were not able as the club to use the player for full 90 minutes at all until now. “Now, running into (qualifier match) – I understand – serving his country and so on. That is why I’m saying ask the player, how is he capable three days later to do something responsible?“ "I have my own idea about it, I have my own way when I’m talking about loading; what is the idea behind effective training loading and structure.“ "One idea behind this is to get the players totally injury free, and secondly the idea is to try as much as possible to get the player to a certain competitiveness (level) that they can contribute to a team performance.” Billiat, however, has thanked the club for acceding to his national request, and has also declared himself fit to feature against Polokwane City in the league clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday. “I wish to thank the club for acceding to the call up,” said Billiat. “As you know I was nursing an injury, but the club and the national team management agreed to my release. We thought the match would provide a good platform to test my recovery.”
