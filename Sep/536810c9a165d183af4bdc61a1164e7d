During puberty, the 4-5
will grow in both length and width. Once puberty ends, there
is unlikely to be any further 4-5 growth. That said, some males may
experience growth into their early 20s. Many males have concerns
about the size of their penis at some point. However, Medical News
Today research has shown that most men have a 4-5 size that is within the
normal ranges. For boys, puberty
generally occurs between the ages of 12 and 16. It can begin at any point
between the ages of 8 and 14 and may last for up to 4 years. During this time, the 4-5 will
get longer and thicker. The rate at which growth occurs varies from one person
to another. Once puberty ends, then
the 4-5 will stop growing. This is typically by the time the male reaches 18
years of age. Other changes that affect
the penis and genitals during puberty include:  Research on 15,521 people
from around the world reports that the average penis length is 9.16 centimeters
(cm), or 3.61 inches ("), when sleeping and 13.12 cm, or 5.16", when
it is awake. The average girth, or
circumference, is: 9.31 cm, or 3.67", when sleeping 11.66 cm, or 4.59",
when it is awake. Studies show that most
males who believe they have a short penis overestimate the average penis
length. The majority of these people are actually within the normal ranges of
penis size.
