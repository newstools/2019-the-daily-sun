KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp is head and shoulders above the rest so far this season. The German born mentor has been tipped to walk away with the Absa Premiership Coach of the Month award for August, to be held at the PSL Offices in Parktown, Joburg on Thursday. He gave Amakhosi fans belief that they can lift the title come end of the season since they are unbeaten so far in four matches. They beat Cape Town City 2-1 in their last game before the Fifa calendar break, drew 1-1 with SuperSport United, beat Black Leopards 1-0 and Highlands Park 3-2 in their first match. Middendorp had to prove to the hard to please Amakhosi fans that he is capable of turning their fortunes around in a bid to end the four year trophy drought having finished in an unfamiliar ninth position last season failing to help them qualify for MTN8 Cup. Meanwhile, Amakhosi defender Mulomowandau Mathoho and SuperSport United deadly striker Bradley Grobler are in a neck to neck race for the Absa Premiership Player Of Month accolade for August. Mathoho showed that he has put behind all the setback that saw him struggle for game time last season due to a niggling injury to become Amakhosi’ joint top scorer with Lebogang Manyama on two goals. On the other hand,  Grobler has showed predator instinct in front of goal having scored four goals to become the League’s top scorer with one goal ahead of Highlands Park winger Peter Shalulile.
