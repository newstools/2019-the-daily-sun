MATRICS from schools in Cape Town met at Langa’s St Francis Church recently. Motivational speaker Thembinkosi Matika organised the seminar after seeing how grade 12s failed, yet had afternoon classes and tutors. “When you’re in grade 12, you need to push yourself and know what you want and where you’re going,” said Thembinkosi. He said his job was to tell the pupils they could be anything they wanted to be, irrespective of their background. “At this seminar, we prepare them for university because when they get there, no one will push them.” He said they’d hold a camp after the seminar. Fellow motivational speaker Siyavuya Mlungu said pupils should have a vision of what they’re going to do after matric. Siseko Sawutana (18), a grade 12 pupil at Mfuleni High School, said the seminar would prepare him for exams and life after matric. “Some of us don’t know what we’re going to study at university,” he said. “We were told we can’t just write exams without knowing where we’re going.” He believed he could achieve anything in life, despite issues he faced ekasi.
