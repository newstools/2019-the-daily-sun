THE Komape family will have to wait longer for justice for their son. This after presentations by Section27 in their son’s case were completed and judgment was reserved. The family was in Bloemfontein, Free State. They were appealing the judgment by Judge Gerrit Muller of the Limpopo High Court, who dismissed claims for R2 million for emotional shock and grief caused by their son’s death. They appealed through the human rights lobby group, Section27. The family also brought forward a civil claim against the education department of R940 000 in general damages, including trauma. Little Michael Komape drowned inside a dilapidated pit toilet at Mahlodumela Primary School in Chebeng Village, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, in 2014. Advocate Vincent Maleka, senior council for Section27, led a legal team which faced a panel of five judges. He told the court that Michael’s parents took it further after there was no apology from any of the respondents charged with protecting their son. “Michael died at the hands of those charged with protecting him. His body was in the pit toilet for at least four hours. His father also sought to take photos of the scene, but was ordered by the police to delete them,” he said. Zukiswa Pikoli of Section27 said they won’t say much as all the exhibitions were made before the court of law and they awaited the judgment. The lobby group said the court had not given them the judgment date. It would inform them soon.
