THOSE looking for entry level passenger cars will have a headache choosing which one to buy. These days many cars coming to the market are really cool with some irresistible features. The latest one, with plenty of peculiarity, is the Mazda 3, which comes out guns blazing when it comes to stunning new features. Let’s firstly discuss its design, which is really stylish with fine-tuned surfaces and lines that make it look like no other Mazdas.  The 7th generation Mazda3 sets a new milestone and after driving the hatch, one believes this brand will rock the segment when it comes to sales. We agree that with this Mazda, the designers made a good blend with beautiful designs and exciting driving dynamics. The body features a horizontal flow that accentuates the look of a wide and low stance, while presenting a calmness that appeals to a sophisticated audience. Exclusive to the Mazda3 hatch, polymetal grey is a newly developed exterior paint option that fuses the hard appearance of metal with a glossy smoothness, to create an entirely new expression of style. Other differences include the black roof lining on the hatch derivatives from the Active model.  The Astina hatch gets black metallic 18” alloy wheels. Sedan derivatives have grey roof lining and on the Astina model, silver metallic 18” alloy wheels. However, the real magic is inside the Mazda 3. The centre console has been redesigned with the shift knob, new commander control and armrest moved forward, while the cupholders are repositioned to the front. The clear view of the driver facing the MZD Connect screen with improved system performance, standard Android Auto and Apple Carplay and heads-up display help keep the driver focused on the road. The adjustable upright driver seating position with a low centre of gravity lends a reassuring sense of confidence when driving. We are not complaining that you pay R359 900 to own the Mazda 3 1.5L Active Manual Hatch and Sedan, it matches the work.
