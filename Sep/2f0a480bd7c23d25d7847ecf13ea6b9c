SPARKS are bound to fly when two rising junior welterweight African champions Jabulani Makhense and Marios Matamba put their respective regional crowns on the line at Emperors Palace on Saturday night. Makhense, who is a World Boxing Association Pan African, finally answered a call by IBF African titlist. The South African-based Congolese has been calling for Pretoria based prospect every time he gets an opportunity to speak. Both Makhense and Matamba are undefeated, and their clash will determine who is the king of junior welterweight division. Even the local boxing enthusiasts are eager to watch their match. This contest promises to be one of those local titanic battle, as both camps have declared their state of readiness ahead of the big clash. Makhense and Matamba will be the main supporting bout on boxing feast themed ‘Fist of Steel’ presented by Golden Gloves. Heading the bill will be the IBO championship bout between defending champion Kevin Lerena and Seferi Sefer. Makhense’s mentor Sebastain Rothmann, who was not initially keen on the fight, said: “As the fight was first announced, I called the opposition corner to know how they felt about it. I strongly believe that down the road these guys will be champions. It doesn’t make sense to make the fight happen now. “The reason we put it now is because both fighters want to go to the next level and the sooner they meet, the faster they make money. Matamba is unbelievably strong and a come forward fighter. I’m sure he will bring the best out of Makhense. “I back Jabulani on this one. I think he is the best talented fighter after Mzukisi Skali. “He never had second thoughts on this fight.” On the other hand, Shaun Smith said this is the right time for the young gladiators to lock horns. “I think it’s time to see who is the best junior welterweight in the country, and we don’t have to waste time. This is the fight to see, if we are good to go to the next level or not, so we are ready for Saturday night,” he said.
