SWALLOWS FC have parted ways with their coach Zeca Marques following a string of poor and compromising results. A lot was expected from the Moroka club but results have not been forthcoming since they bought their way back to the GladAfrica Championship. "Swallows parted ways with Head Coach Zeca Marques in a mutual and amicable agreement after 5 games at the helm. We extend our gratitude and support to Zeca and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavours," the club said in a statement on Tuesday. SunSport understands that Fani Madida will be taking over the hot-seat on an acting capacity until they find a suitable replacement.  "Swallows are a big club and they cannot carry on losing matches at the rate in which they are," our mole said. "We expect a lot from Fani who has been a servant of football, and he knows his stuff very well." Swallows chairman David Mogashoa confirmed the sacking of Marques and Madida coming in. "Results were not forthcoming and we had to make tough decision after our monetary investment in the club," said Mogashoa. Marques' mandate was to promote the club back to to the PSL but their defeats to clubs like Steenberg United (2-1) and 3-0 to TTM did not do them any world of favours. Their own notable win was a 3-2 triumph against Royal Eagles last week.
