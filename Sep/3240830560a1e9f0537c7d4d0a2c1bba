SAD madala believes he’ll die without getting a place to call home. He said he was allegedly told by a ward councillor Mncedisi Dlamini to divorce his wife, who left him 15 years ago, or forget about an RDP. Madala Fano Ntombela (60) lives alone in a collapsing shack in Nkumba Village in Bulwer, southern KZN. The madala, who lives with a disability, told Daily Sun  he slept with one eye open as he feared criminals would break in and kill him for his pension money. He said his shack was broken into several times this year but the councillor was not interested. Fano said he applied for an RDP in 2015, but earlier this year he was told his name was removed as he did not qualify since his wife had an RDP in Durban. He said the councillor told him he won’t get an RDP as he was still married.  Human Settlements officials picked up that his wife already had an RDP. “I don’t think I’ll ever get proper shelter before I die. “I’ve been waiting for my RDP for years now, yet I was told to get a divorce first,” he said. DA councillor Victor Phoswa said he had demanded to know when the municipality would help Madala Fano, irrespective of his marital problems. Dlamini admitted that Fano’s name was removed from the list as his wife had an RDP in Durban. He said government allocated one house per couple, and the madala couldn’t get the house unless he divorced his wife. Human settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said by law government could only allocate one RDP per couple. He said even if the couple divorced, they would both no longer qualify for government subsidy as they needed to sell the house and share the money.
