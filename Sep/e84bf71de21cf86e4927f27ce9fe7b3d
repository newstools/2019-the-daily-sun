TS SPORTING have sacked their coach Sly Mosala and his assistant Solly Luvhengo. The two men where showed the exit door following the GladAfrica Championship outfit’s dismal start to their league campaign. The Mpumalanga-based side have failed to register a win in their three opening league games. They lost two and have drawn the other match. Sporting lost 3-1 to Steenberg United and 1-0 to Richard Bay and drew 1-1 with Soweto giants Moroka Swallows. Sporting are currently second from bottom with only one point. According to our source close to the club, Sporting management wasted no time and they have already replaced the two men with former Absa Premiership side Baroka assistant coach Macdonald Makhubedu. Makhubedu has been training the team and is expected to be on the bench when they travel to Goble Park to face Free State Stars on Saturday (3pm). “All we were told is that they have been given a two-weeks break to attend family matters,” said the source. “But truth is Mcdonald is the new coach. He has been training the team.” Sporting manager Vusi Ntimane said he does not know anything about Mosala and Luvhengo having been fired. “I don’t know anything about that,” he said when contacted by SunSport. Luvhengo who has been seen in Venda in his home town of Shayandima also refused to comment. “I am not commenting about this matter,” said the former South Africa Under-20 head coach. Mosala did not answer his phone when contacted. However, Makhubedu said he has been invited to just help the team. “It is true, I am here at Sporting,” he said. “But I am working with coaches Sly and Solly. Let’s see what will happen. But I am here to help the team and make sure we move from the position we are in.”
