A 24-year-old man has decided to marry his 81-year-old cousin. He did this 'to avoid having to do his military service'. Alexander Kondratyuk from in Ukraine, 'formed a strong bond
with his 81-year-old cousin' Zinaida Illarionovna (81). He wed her in a village called Baykovka in west Ukraine. Ukrainian officials are investigating claims that a
24-year-old man married his 81-year-old disabled cousin to escape having to do
military service.  UKâ€™s Daily Mail reports that Kondratyuk claimed to have
developed a strong affection for the cousin, who is 57 years his senior, and
denied that he was trying to get out of performing his military duty. Conscription in Ukraine is compulsory though there are
exceptions that allow people to avoid it. If you look after a wife who is disabled and can prove the
condition and marriage with official documents, you are exempt from
service. The wedding took place in the village of Baykovka which is
near the city of Vinnitsa in west-central Ukraine, located on the banks of one
of the longest rivers in the country. Questioned by reporters about her marriage to her much
younger relative, Zinaida Illarionovna, 81, insisted that he was a good husband
and looked after her carefully. Neighbours of hers claimed that the man was never seen in
the area. One told local TV that the Illarionovna was 'much more
likely to be visited by her nephews, grandchildren and sisters than by her
supposed husband.' They said that she lived in the house alone and that the
only visible sign of the marriage was the certificate that he took with him
every time the draft board turned up in the area to bring in new recruits. By
showing the proof of marriage, and her disability certificate, he was allowed
each time to return home without signing up.
