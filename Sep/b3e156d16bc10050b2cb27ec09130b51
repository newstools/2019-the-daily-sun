Two police officers stationed at Morebeng SAPS have been
arrested on Tuesday for allegedly defrauding a local informal betting ring
commonly known as Fafi through illegal spot fines. Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke said the
officers who are both aged 37, and attached to crime prevention allegedly
arrested the complainant on different occasions for reportedly operating
(mo-china). The cops issued spot fines payable to them as admission
of guilt and they would issue a receipt on each occasion. He said the complainant alerted the Hawks’ Serious
Corruption Crime Investigation team after he suspected that the money could
have been lining up the officers pockets instead of being registered at the
station. The Hawks investigation revealed that the amounts that
were recorded in the admission of guilt register between June and August 2019
did not correspond with the ones on the complainant’s receipts. The Sergeant and a Constable were arrested at their
workplace and are expected to appear at the Morebeng Magistrate’s Court on
Wednesday, to face fraud charges.
