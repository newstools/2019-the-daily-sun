READ: PICS: SINGER ZONKE'S GORGEOUS HOUSE AND CARS Council CEO Sonwabile Mancotywa said music is, especially in the country, one of the most influential conveyors of culture and heritage. “For example, with the advent of Bantustans and forced removal of non-whites from neighbourhoods such as Sophiatown, black South Africans turned to one of the most important pillars of their culture: music. They used it to express their resistance, forge unity and celebrate their being.” Among the previous recipients of the Lifetime Achievement are renowned traditionalist and conservationist Grace Masuku, celebrated traditional healer and author Dr Credo Mutwa, poet and writer Dr Wally Serote and jazz legend Jonas Gwangwa. The awards will also recognise and give prizes to 22 other recipients who went through a public nomination and adjudication process in 16 different categories.
