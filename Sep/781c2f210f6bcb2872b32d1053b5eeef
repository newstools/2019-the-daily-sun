Former Ajax Cape Town forward Nathan Paulse has, for the second time, called time on his football career. The 37-year-old called it quits from the beautiful game in 2017 but was convinced by Roger De Sa a year later to join Cape Umoya United in the National First Division (NFD). Paulse, who also played for Bloemfontein Celtic, SuperSport United and Platinum Stars, has now confirmed that he has taking up a coaching post with the Ajax Cape Town reserve team. When asked about his plans, Paulse told KickOff: "Officially retired. "(I'm) Coaching at Ajax with their reserve team in the ABC Motsepe League and I started South Africa's first career development service for amateur and pro footballers called Starting XI Revolution. "(It) Presented the perfect opportunity to shift focus into my next phase football. I'm very excited with this next phase which I believe will have greater impact on South African football. "I had a top professional career which started in 2000 and lasted 19 years, ended as Ajax Cape Townâ€™s all-time top scorer, won a few cups with Ajax Cape Town in my time, appeared in numerous cup finals for Ajax, went close to winning the Absa (Premiership) twice with Ajax in early 2000s. "All in all, I would say my career was a success of which I'm very proud of."
