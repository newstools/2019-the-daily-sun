Signaling new territory for the Toyota Quantum, the Quantum VX enters the luxury-people-carrier arena with an impressive array of luxury and comfort features. This new addition to the Quantum line-up features the latest Toyota Safety Sense driver-assistance technologies along with luxury features that will appeal to high-end family, hospitality and corporate buyers. Looking at it from the outside, using the angular design language of the new Quantum as a starting point, the VX version amplifies the visual drama with a large chrome-finished radiator grille with three horizontal slats which flow from the stylised LED headlamps. A thin chrome strip bridges the opposing LED fog lamps in the lower front apron. The wheel and tyre package comprises 17” alloy wheels shod with 235-60-R17 tyres. The Quantum VX provides an almost limousine-like degree of cabin comfort and refinement for up to eight passengers (9-seater) with large captain’s chairs, independent rear climate control and multiple USB ports to keep devices fully charged for business or entertainment.  The interior layout feature a rear cabin with four individual reclining Captain’s chairs (with armrests and fold out “ottoman” leg-rests) in the second and third row, complemented by a three-seat 60/40-split bench in the rear. Driver and passengers are well catered for with front and rear climate control, smart entry and start, dual power-operated sliding doors and Toyota’s Audio Visual Navigation touchscreen infotainment system. The Quantum VX features an array of driver assistance features as part of the Toyota Safety Sense suite, which includes pre-collision safety system with pedestrian detection (day and night) and cyclist detection (day only) 3; high-speed active cruise control; lane departure alert; road sign assist; and automatic high beam.
