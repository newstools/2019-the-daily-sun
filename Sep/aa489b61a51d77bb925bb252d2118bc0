WELL-TRAVELLED winger Mark Mayambela is set to join Cape Town City before the end of the month, according to sources close to the player. Mayambela, who is a free agent, is training with Benni McCarthy’s Cape Town City with the hope of securing a deal after parting ways with Chippa United in June. City boss John Comitis confirmed to SunSport yesterday from the United States that the former Orlando Pirates midfielder is training with City, but “not signed... keeping fit”. The 32-year-old from Khayelitsha previously played for the club when it was still known as Mpumalanga Black Aces before Comitis bought the status in 2016 and moved it to the Mother City. If Mayambela does impress McCarthy, he will be reuniting with the Bafana Bafana all-time goal scorer. Mayambela and McCarthy played together at Pirates when the former striker was still at the twilight of his career. They were part of the Buccaneers team that claimed the second treble in 2011-12 season. If he joins City, it’ll also be the second time that Mayambela is playing in his home province, Western Cape, having previously played for the Urban Warriors in 2016-17 season. Mayambela is one of few accomplished footballers in the PSL to have won all the trophies domestically. He has won the league title twice, MTN8 twice, Telkom Knockout and two Nedbank Cup titles. City are out to plug the gap left open by Gift Links, who recently signed for Danish side AGF. Links was used in both sides of the flanks before he left.
