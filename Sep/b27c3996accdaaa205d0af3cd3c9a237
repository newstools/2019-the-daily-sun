A woman by the name of Danielle Griffin has sued Chris Brown
for eye injuries she allegedly suffered on a music video shoot. According to TMZ, Danielle was hired as a backup dancer in September
2017 to perform in Pop RnB Chris Brown’s Music video High End in Los Angeles.  During the suit, a makeup and wardrobe artist poured fake
liquid blood on her head without eye protection and told Danielle it was safe
according to her lawsuit.   Her attorney, Arshia Mardasi of Allen, Flatt, Ballidis &
Leslie, told TMZ that Danielle had to go to three different hospitals in 24
hours to tend to her eye injuries. Arshia added that it took months for
Danielle to recover, which caused her to drop out of her Master’s degree
program and miss several job opportunities. TMZ tried to reach Chris Brown but still have not had any
word from him.
