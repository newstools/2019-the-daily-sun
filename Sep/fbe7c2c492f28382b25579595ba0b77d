THE court has refused to relax the bail conditions for kak nurse Elizabeth Williams. “The court can’t consider it unless there’s a witness to testify before court that Williams still has a job,” said Magistrate Bukiwe Sambudla in Goodwood Magistrates Court yesterday. Williams and her four co-accused appeared in court for allegedly forcing a woman to eat dog faeces as punishment for having sex with her lover. Williams, through her lawyer Andrew Joyce, said she still had a job after the resignation letter she handed in on 5 August was rejected. Joyce said he would ask the hospital official who testified last month if Williams’ resignation letter was decline by the hospital. Joyce asked the court to consider the relaxation of the house arrest to allow Williams to look for jobs elsewhere. “My application was not only about the relaxation of Tygerberg, but I also want the court to relax the house arrest so she can attend other work outside the area.” Sambudla said she’ll only attend to the matter after evidence from an official that is to be brought by the defence. The matter will be heard on 7 October.
