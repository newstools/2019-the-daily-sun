It may be stressful cleaning and maintaining alloy wheels, but they make your car look great. They face tough conditions from everyday road use too! With dust settling on them from brake pad and brake shoe wear and tear but other dirt too from the road surface. Carmakers will often tell you to just use soap and water, but you will have to do this often to keep damage from occurring. Aside from soap and water, there are also several over-the-counter alloy wheel cleaners abound. Never use abrasive cleaners, polishing compounds, or steel wool to clean alloy wheels. Use a specially made alloy wheel brush if you must use one. Wait to wash your wheels until the car is cooled off, so the heat doesnâ€™t evaporate the water, leaving soap spots on the wheels. Also, do not steam-clean your wheels, as this can harm the finish.
