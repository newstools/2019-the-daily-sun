Two security guards were shot and injured in an attack on
their unmarked vehicle in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, on Wednesday morning,
Eastern Cape police say.  The guards had stopped to pick up another colleague in their
unmarked Isuzu bakkie around 04:50, when a man walked up to the passenger side
and opened fire on the two guards, said Captain Andre Beetge.  "He did not attempt to rob the guards and fled the
scene in an unknown vehicle that sped off afterwards," he said.  "The third member that was still in his house at the
time only heard the shots being fired and contacted police and rushed outside
to assist his injured fellow workers."  The driver, 39, was in a critical condition after being shot
in the left side of the chest. His passenger, 35, was shot in the left leg and
was stable.  Beetge said it was not yet clear what the motive for the
attack was. Police were investigating a case of attempted murder.  Motherwell cluster commander Major General Dawie Rabie said
he was concerned about the shooting.  "Although these two guards were not robbed, we need to
call on our communities to come forward in assisting with the identification of
these suspects and also the locations where illegal firearms are being hidden
and kept," he said.  "Today it is security guards, tomorrow it will be
persons of the community being targeted. We need to get these suspects and
their firearms off our streets to secure a safe environment for our
communities."  Anyone with information on the shooting can contact Captain
Frank van der Berg on 082 394 5957.  https://news24wire.com/browse/feeds#source-news24wire|Digital|2aa494c6-5141-47db-84e3-27e7881593f0
