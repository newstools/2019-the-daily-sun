THE Pepese family has been living under constant threat of eviction for almost 20 years. Fundile Pepese (66) told Daily Sun he started living on Vetmaakvlakte farm in Colchester, Nelson Mandela Bay, in 1990. He was working for Colchester Motors as a petrol attendant. His employer had a lease agreement with the farm to accommodate its workers but in 2001, Fundile retired and farm owner Colette Botha started threatening to evict him and his family. Fundile said: “I don’t want to move from this plot because this is the only place I call home. I raised all of my 13 children here. “The owner tried to evict me through the courts in 2008 but failed.” Fundile said his family was not allowed to use the farm gates, or grow crops. His wife, Betty (63), was left paralysed by a stroke and couldn’t use the nine-step ladder the family climbed to enter and leave the farm. Botha said the contract with Colchester Motors ended when RDP houses were built in town. “But Fundile continued to live on the farm for several years without paying rent. “At the end of October 2006, he owed R3 420. His occupation of the farm is illegal,” she said. Botha said in 2008 she took the case to the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court and Fundile defended the matter.
