THE finance union SASBO has warned the people of Mzansi to have enough cash on them. Over 50 000 workers in the banking sector will go on strike, retrenchment in the industry. BUSA said in a statement that: “Please be advised that we have responded clearly and unequivocally indicating that our planned action of 27 September 2019 will continue as scheduled”. COSATU issued a notice as per section 77 of the Labour Relations Act (LRA) to Nedlac that it and including its affiliates, will be embarking on legally protected protest action. SASBO says the mass strike will be under the banner “Economic Crisis”. Cosatu has called for a TOTAL SHUT DOWN of the economy on Friday, 27 September 2019. “We reiterate that Sasbo is principally and fundamentally opposed to job losses and retrenchments. We remain concerned about the high levels of unemployment (29%), the state of our economy, the current and future impact of the 4th Industrial Revolution,” SASBO General Secretary Joe Kokela I a statement said. Kokela said the implications amongst others are that the economy cannot afford for even one job to be lost.
