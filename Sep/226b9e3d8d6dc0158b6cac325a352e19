AMAZULU coach Cavin Johnson has been fired, the club confirmed on Monday. Johnson is the second coach to get the sack this week after Chippa United also fired Clinton Larsen. Both teams have lost patience with their respective coaches following poor starts to the season. Johnson’s departure comes after his side were held to a 1-1 draw by city rivals Golden Arrows in the KZN derby at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium over the weekend. AmaZulu have collected a mere two points from their five games so far in the league. They are rooted to the bottom of the table still awaiting their first win of the campaign. “AmaZulu FC and Cavin Johnson have terminated their working relationship.The board of directors of AmaZulu FC have reached a decision to release head coach,Johnson, from his contract with immediate effect.” The club confirmed on social media. “We wish Mr Johnson the best of luck in his career. The next focus for the club will be towards getting back on track since results have eluded us so far this season,” added General Manager Lunga Sokhele.
