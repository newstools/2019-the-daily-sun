WHEN gospel star Hlengiwe Mhlaba managed to avoid a head-on collision on Saturday night it was the third time this year that she had stared Death in the face. She was on her way to Ermelo, Mpumlanga, between Melmoth and Vryheid, KZN when she avoided a vehicle coming towards her in her lane. Family spokesman Nkululeko Khanyi told Daily Sun: “She tried to avoid the car and her Mercedes Benz went up the mountain and rolled,” he said. Nkululeko said Hlengiwe was not able to talk now. Nkululeko said that Hlengiwe was with her team when the accident took place. “She is not in a position to say anything for now. On her behalf and that of her family, we ask the nation to pray for her,” said Nkululeko. He said that she and her team were admitted to a private hospital in Northern Zululand. “Doctors are still busy with them. We have faith that they will be well.” In June last year, Daily Sun told the story about how she avoided a head-on collision. She said it was by the grace of God that she survived. This is the third accident Hlengiwe has had this year. She had an accident earlier this year in Durban and another four months ago on her way to Joburg from Durban. Nkululeko said prayer was the only thing that could protect her.
