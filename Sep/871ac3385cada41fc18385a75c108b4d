KINGSTON Nkatha arrived in South Africa after an impressive spell in Zimbabwe where he played for Buymore FC and Caps United. He was brought to South Africa by Free State Stars in 2007 and after a couple of seasons in Bethlehem at Ea lla Koto, he left for Black Leopards where he established himself as a feared goal-poacher of note. Chiefs did not hesitate and poached him when Stuart Baxter in charge. But he fell victim to persistent booing from the Chiefs fans who were frustrated by his inconsistency.  Even though he missed a lot of scoring opportunities, he created a lot of chances for his fellow strikers. Coach Baxter tried to explain to the fans that Nkhatha was a good decoy for opposition because defenders chased him around and that opened up gaps for his teammates to score many goals. He played 69 matches for Amakhosi and scored 19 goals. He then left Chiefs for SuperSport United, scoring 10 goals in the same number of matches. In 2018, he went back home in Zimbabwe to join Dynamos FC before returning to Mzansi and he is now on the books of Mbombela United. He is now 33 years-old and has played 10 times for the Zimbabwe senior national team. How best do you remember Nkhatha?
