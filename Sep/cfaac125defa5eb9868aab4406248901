THE Springboks’ depth is a major asset for the team at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, according to front-rankers Vincent Koch and Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira in Nagoya. Both players will start in the Pool B clash against Namibia tomorrow at the City of Toyota Stadium (11.45am), with Koch getting a chance in place of the injured Trevor Nyakane, who was ruled out of the World Cup following a right calf injury sustained in the 23-13 loss to New Zealand. Thomas du Toit is on the bench, having joined the Springbok squad as a replacement for Nyakane. Koch, who boasts 15 Tests and last featured in the 24-18 win over Argentina in Pretoria last month, said he felt for Nyakane. “He’s had an unbelievable season and has done really well for the Springboks. “But on the other hand it gives me a chance,” Koch said. Mtawarira added: “We’re definitely going to miss Trevor but having a guy like Thomas back in the fold is really good. I think this team have always relied on the depth of the squad.” Namibia coach Phil Davies yesterday made sweeping changes to his team with 10 changes to the starting line-up which lost 47-22 to Italy last Sunday. Only captain Tjiuee Uanivi, Cliven Loubser, JC Greyling, Chad Plato and Johan Tromp return. The match will be only the third meeting between the countries, with the Boks winning 105-13 at Newlands on the eve of the 2007 World Cup and 87-0 at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand. – SPORT24 TEAMS South Africa 15 Warrick Gelant 14 Sbu Nkosi 13 Lukhanyo Am 12 Frans Steyn 11 Makazole Mapimpi 10 Elton Jantjies 9 Herschel Jantjies 8 Schalk Brits (captain) 7 Kwagga Smith, 6 Francois Louw 5 Lood de Jager 4 RG Snyman 3 Vincent Koch 2 Bongi Mbonambi 1 Tendai Mtawarira ) Substitutes: 16 Steven Kitshoff, 17 Thomas du Toit, 18 Eben Etzebeth, 19 Siya Kolisi, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Cobus Reinach, 22 Damian de Allende, 23 Cheslin Kolbe Namibia 15 Johan Tromp 14 Chad Plato 13 JC Greyling 12 Peter John Walters 11 Lesley Klim 10 Cliven Loubser 9 Eugene Jantjies 8 Adriaan Booysen 7 Muharua Katjijeko 6 Thomasau Forbes 5 Tjiuee Uanivi (captain) 4 Johan Retief 3 AJ de Klerk 2 Louis van der Westhuizen 1 Desiderius Sethie
