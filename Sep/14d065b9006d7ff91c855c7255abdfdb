BLOOD tests have revealed there were traces of Paracetamol pills and brake fluid in Natasha Conabeer’s system. This was shared by family spokeswoman Nosipho Goba when Premier Sihle Zikalala and mayor Mxolisi Kaunda visited Natasha’s home in Inanda, north of Durban. Natasha died in hospital on Monday. She had been missing for three weeks.  Nosipho said mum Rosemary (63) found Natasha lying on the doorstep, unconscious, on Sunday morning. “She took her inside but Natasha didn’t even open her eyes. She was only vomiting,” said Nosipho. She said the hospital suspected Natasha was poisoned.   “As a result, most of her organs failed and she passed away.”  Rosemary was too distraught to talk. Zikalala said officials would work closely with cops to fast-track the investigation. “We want the perpetrators behind bars,” said Zikalala.  “It’s embarrassing to live in an environment where women are abused and killed.”
