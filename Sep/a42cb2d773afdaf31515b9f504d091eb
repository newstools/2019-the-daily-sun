Three men employed by a school in the Eastern Cape town of
Ngcobo will be appearing in the Ngcobo Magistrate's Court for allegedly raping
three boys. They reportedly went to the boys homes under the pretence of
helping them with their homework, before plying them with alcohol. Two of the men are teachers at the school, while the third
is a clerk, according to the Eastern Cape Department of Education. They were
arrested on Sunday. In a statement, police spokesperson Captain Namhla Mdleleni
said: "It is alleged that three boys, between 14 and 17 years, were taken
by the suspects to their place of residence. "On arriving, they allegedly gave them alcohol and
raped them." The rapes allegedly took place between June and August this
year. Mdleleni said on Saturday that a case of rape had been
opened. "All the suspects, who are between the ages of 30 and
49, were arrested on Sunday," said Mdleleni. 'Disgusting incident' Eastern Cape education department spokesperson Malibongwe
Mtima told News24 they were shocked about the "disgusting" incident. "This is disgusting, to say the least," Mtima
said. "The department is working with the police to ensure that the
suspects face the wrath of the law." Mtima said educators who sexually abused learners
"abdicate their responsibility" and showed "low morality"
when they did "such horrendous things to kids". Suspension letters had been served on the accused staff
members, Mtima said. Dispatch Live reported that the arrests had shocked the
Ngcobo community, with a crowd of more than 400 people arriving at the school
on Monday morning, demanding answers. Officials from the education department reportedly met with
community members at the school. SOURCE: NEWS24
