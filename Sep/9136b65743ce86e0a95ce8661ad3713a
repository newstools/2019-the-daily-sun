WHEN the Molongwanes saw a homeless man, they gave him a place to stay. They also gave him a job as a caretaker at their home in Soshanguve extension 3, north of Tshwane. READ: COPS RECOVER MERCEDES G-WAGON! According to Didi Molongwane (36), their dog Ricky and their cars’ tyres were stolen last Wednesday. When they confronted the caretaker, he didn’t know what had happened to the tyres or where Ricky was. The badly injured dog returned home three days later. “It had wounds on its jaw and other parts of the body. It looked as if it had been tied up and beaten,” Didi told Daily Sun. She said the family didn’t care much about the stolen tyres but was more concerned about the pet.  “That dog has been protecting our home for a long time. It’s more than just a pet and it hurts seeing it like this,” she said. She said the family liked helping others, especially the poor. “We thought the man needed help when we took him in a year ago,” she said. “We didn’t know he might be a thug. We only found out when the police told us he was a suspect.” SPCA spokesman inspector Mishack Matlou said they were saddened by what had happened to the dog. Soshanguve police spokeswoman Constable Portia Sebone said cases of animal cruelty and theft were opened. “The man was arrested and appeared in the Pretoria North Magistrates Court yesterday, and his case was postponed. The suspect remains in custody,” Sebone told the People’s Paper.
