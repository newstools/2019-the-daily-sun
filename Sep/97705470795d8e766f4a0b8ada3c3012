BANYANA Banyana vice-captain Refiloe Jane has made her official debut for AC Milan. Jane made history on Thursday when she joined the Italian giants on a one year contract - becoming the first South African woman to sign with an Italian club. And she did not waste any time getting stuck in as she made her first appearance for the Italian outfit against Napoli on Saturday. Despite only linking up with her new teammates on Friday, Jane was handed a starting berth by her new coach Maurizio Ganz. Jane went on to put in a solid performance in midfield as Milan thumped Napoli 5-0. The Soweto-born star will now be looking to cement her spot in the team and playing a crucial role for the Serie A Womenâ€™s League outfit for the remainder of the campaign. The 27-year-old veteran who has accumulated more than 100 caps with Banyana starred for Canberra United in the W-League in Australia last season.
