IF you want to know which day your birthday will fall on in 2022, just ask Philane. The 31-year-old shared his talent with the SunTeam by saying which day this reporter’s birthday would fall in a few years’ time after being provided with the birth date, month and year. Philane Hlongwane grew up in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni, where he was raised by his mum Thabile, who died in 1990. He moved to Soweto, where he lives with a friend. He said at the age of 21, he realised he loved numbers and sums. “I’m a University of Joburg human resources graduate, but finding a job has been difficult.” Being good at maths helped. “The love of playing around with calculations extended to another level.” He said he could tell any day of the month when provided with a random date between the years 1878 and 2025. “If you tell me you were born on 8 August 1990, I can tell you which day it was by reversing the years in my head. “I used to spend time going through my smartphone’s calendar. “I noticed dates are reused after every 28 years. This year’s dates and days will be used again in the future after 28 years.” “My ability will come in handy one day. It will help trace memories through days.”
