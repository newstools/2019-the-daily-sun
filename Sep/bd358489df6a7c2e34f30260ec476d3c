THE EFF hosted
a memorial service for former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. The Orlando
East Community Hall in Soweto was filled as hundreds of people gathered to
remember Mugabe. EFF leader
Julius Malema said: “Mugabe was a guerrilla fighter, he fought Ian Smith and
his armies and that is why today the people of Zimbabwe can speak freely,” he
said.  “We cannot
remember him and not stress his love of education. This was evidenced by the
fact that upon being elected president, he transformed Zimbabwe into the most
educated nation on the continent.”  Malema also
condemned those responsible for attacking foreigners in the past few weeks. “The
sanctions imposed on mighty Zimbabwe will be lifted one day and what you don’t
know is that you are attacking your future employers,” he said. Mugabe died
in a hospital in Singapore last week at the age of 95.  Former
Zimbabwean public service minister and Mugabe’s nephew, Patric Zhuwao said he
was forced to live in Singapore. “He was not
in hospital that entire time, he was living in a rented house and only went to
hospital five days before he passed away,” he said.
