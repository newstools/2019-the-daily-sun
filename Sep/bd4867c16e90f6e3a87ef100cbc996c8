The Zamdela
High Court has sentenced Lesia Mokoena to 60 years in jail for rape. He was also
sentenced to 1 year in jail for common assault and 3 years for assault with
intent to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH). This comes
after an 18-year-old victim was walking home from a local tavern with her three
friends when they were approached by two unknown males who began assaulting one
of the male friends and the other two friends managed to run away. “After
assaulting the male friend, the suspects grabbed and dragged the victim by
force to a dumping site near the Oranjeville road where they took turns raping
the victim,” Police spokesperson Constable Josephine Rani said. Rani said in
the same year on 24 July, a 19-year-old victim was walking with her boyfriend
when they met two unknown men who assaulted the victim’s boyfriend then raped
her. She further
said in 2009, Lesia and his accomplice raped a woman and were positively linked
through DNA tests and he was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment which he is
currently serving. “It is
through this case that the suspect was positively linked to the two other cases
committed in 2004. Sergeant
Detective Sophie Kgayane of Zamdela FCS Unit left no stone unturned to make
sure that the suspect is permanently removed from society. Lesia’s accomplice
could not be positively linked to these cases,” Rani said
