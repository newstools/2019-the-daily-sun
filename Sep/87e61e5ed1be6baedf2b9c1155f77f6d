Convicted South African drug mule Nolubabalo
"Babsie" Nobanda will be arriving back in South Africa on Thursday. Nobanda was arrested at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on
December 12, 2011, after getting off a Qatar Airways flight. Approximately 1.5kg of cocaine, with an estimated street
value of R1.2m, was found in her dreadlocks after police noticed a white
substance in her hair, News24 earlier reported. Nobanda told Thailand authorities that she had been hired to
deliver the drugs to a customer at a hotel in Bankgok. Initially sentenced to 30 years in prison, Nobanda's
sentence was first halved and then reduced by two-and-a-half years in May. In August, Department of International Relations and
Cooperation spokesperson Nelson Kgwete announced that Nobanda would be released
from prison. "The South African embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, has
confirmed having received a written notification from the Thai authorities
informing the embassy that Ms Nolubabalo Nobanda is due to be released from
detention on August 27." After Nobanda's release from prison, she was moved to an
Immigration Detention Centre, from where she underwent more administrative
processing, before she could return to the country. Another South African drug mule and friend of Nobanda's,
Thando Pendu, returned to South Africa in June this year after being released
from the same prison, DispatchLive reported. The publication said the 33-year-old, who hails from Welkom
in the Free State, arrived at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on
June 27, where family members and supporters greeted her. Pendu had been in prison for drug smuggling since October
2009, Mail & Guardian reported. At the time of her arrest, she was 23 years
old. She had reportedly been promised a job driving ambulances in
Bangkok.  - Compiled by Riaan Grobler SOURCE: NEWS24
