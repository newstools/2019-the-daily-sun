Several
people have been injured during a stampede at the viewing of former Zimbabwean
president Robert Mugabe at the Rufaro Stadium on Thursday, according to
reports. SADC News
reports that the stampede occurred while people were lining up to have a final
viewing of Mugabe. According
to the report, medical teams were brought in. Police then barricaded the scene. The public
invaded the pitch where the coffin was, EyeWitness News reports. Security
has since been upped. Mugabe,
whose autocratic rule ended in a military coup in 2017, died last Friday, aged
95. His body was flown back from Singapore on Wednesday. His body
will lie in state at Kutama on Sunday following a burial early next week in his
private residence and not at a national monument for liberation heroes, his
family said on Thursday. The family
of Mugabe and Zimbabwe's government have been at odds over whether he would be
buried in his homestead in Kutama, northwest of Harare, or at the National
Heroes Acre in the capital, News24 reported earlier.    SOURCE:
