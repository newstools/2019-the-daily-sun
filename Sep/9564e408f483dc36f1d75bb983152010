Public health MMC Yoliswa Pali and other councillors joined hands with residents of Motherwell, KwaZakhele and New Brighton to clean the streets. The initiative was started by the municipality in partnership with the environment department. Pali said: “After noticing the unbearable state of this area, we’re here to assist with cleaning as part of solving the problem of illegal dumping. “Factories dump their rubbish here, causing a health hazard to communities and our environment. “The clean-up will also serve as an awareness programme to teach the community about the dangers of illegal dumping.” Mayoral spokesman George Geleba said the initiative was part of Arbour Month.
