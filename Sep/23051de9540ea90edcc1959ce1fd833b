THIS piece of land is used by residents as grazing ground for their cows, but the animals are not the only ones using the space. Magoshas poke there and sometime leave used condoms, which are then eaten by cows. Residents are now worried they might eat contaminated meat. But magoshas said cows have a special digestive system and condoms would not kill them. Resident Palesa Mosala (37) said she had seen the cows feeding on used condoms.  “I’m not sure if it’s only condoms from magoshas. This is a dumping site for residents and the condoms could be from the homes.” The SunTeam visited the area in Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung and saw some used condoms. Two cows were spotted grazing there with no one looking after them. Livestock owner Solomon Mapuru (67) said he always cleaned the area to protect his cows. One of the herders Motsamai Sikhi said: “I have seen fellow herders remove the condoms, but I don’t want to touch those filthy things.” However, a magosha who identified herself as Mapunani (32), said: “I’ve been poking in this area for more than five years and have never heard of a cow eating a condom.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “This is no different from people littering. We have religiously requested members of the community to stop littering.”
