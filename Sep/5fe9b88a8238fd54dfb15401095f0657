HUMAN rights groups fear the worst after the leader of a union representing the country’s doctors was kidnapped almost a week ago by suspected state security agents. Dr Peter Magombeyi, head of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, has not been heard from since he last sent a WhatsApp message indicating three unidentified men abducted him from his home in the Budiriro neighborhood of the capital Harare. He had organised a series of protests to demand better salaries for government doctors. Before his abduction, he had received an SMS threatening him with disappearance. In a bizarre response, a spokesman for President Emerson Mnangagwa dismissed the abduction as a “characteristic propaganda stunt by the opposition and its supporters”. Dewa Mavhinga, regional director of Human Rights Watch, pointed out Magombeyi’s abduction was not an isolated case. Recent months have seen an alarming spike in abductions and torture of critics of the government and the political opposition. The rights group has documented more than 50 cases of abductions of activists and other critics of the government this year. “So far, none of the perpetrators have been arrested,” said Mavhinga. In an another development, six masked gunmen abducted and beat comedian and government critic Samantha Kureya. She was forced to drink raw sewage before she was released. – CAJ NEWS
