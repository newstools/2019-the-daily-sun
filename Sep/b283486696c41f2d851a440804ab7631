GRAMMY award winning  US Cardi B is known to share a lot of her
life on her social media. The former stripper and reality TV star is worth millions
but yesterday posted a video doing something that some people in Mzansi would
look down on. Cardi B posted a video of herself eating and enjoying a well
marinated chicken foot with the caption “how ya doing?” How ya doing ? A post shared by  Iamcardib (@iamcardib) on Sep 24, 2019 at 5:23pm PDT The almost 80 00 comments on her post were horrified people asking her if she was eating
a foot and some who said they also enjoyed eating ‘amanqina’ or ‘Maotwana’ as
they are called in Mzansi. Her husband, fellow rapper Offset asked “is that a hand?” to
which Cardi replied, “its’ chicken foot babe…I’ll cook some for you”. Some people commented that Cardi was setting a good example
by not letting food go to waste.
