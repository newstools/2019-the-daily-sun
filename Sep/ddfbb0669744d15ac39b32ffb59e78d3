“WHERE are the children. Tell me! Where are they?” These were the words of a distraught gogo after her two grandkids were stabbed. She burst into tears. The kids were allegedly stabbed by their stepdad, a popular DJ. He allegedly stabbed the kids and locked them in an apartment in Bokone Village in Mahikeng after his girlfriend and mum to both kids didn’t sleep at home. According to the landlord, the first person on the scene, he found the boys aged seven and three lying on the ground and bleeding near the locked burglar door. One was still alive and the other had died. “When I looked closer inside the room, I saw the younger one’s throat had been slit,” said the landlord. He then called the mum, who was at work at the time. He said the family told him the kids slept at their gogo’s house the night before the incident. The DJ apparently went there and asked the gogo if he could spend time with the children. He allegedly then took them to his rented place, where they were stabbed. The mum rushed to hospital after she heard one of the children was taken there. The mum’s devastated uncle said: “I’m confused. Yes, they fought. But this is cruel.” Captain Adele Myburgh said cases of murder and attempted murder were opened. She said the incident happened at about 12.30pm and cops were called to the scene. “They certified the three-year-old child dead, while the seven-year-old was fighting for his life,” Myburgh told Daily Sun. “Anyone with information is requested to go to their nearest cop shop.”
