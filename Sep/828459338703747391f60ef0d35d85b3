Shavkatdzhon Rakhimov from Ekateringburg, Russia, who is the current IBO junior lightweight champion, is coming off a fourth-round stoppage win over South African Rofhiwa Maemu in defence of his belt on 23 March this year. The question being asked now is, can he emerge as victor over South Africa’s Azinga Fuzile in an IBF junior lightweight title eliminator on 29 September in East London. Rakhimov’s IBO belt will not be at stake. The 23-year-old Fuzile (14-0; 8), who is rated at No. 4 by the IBF, is without a doubt South Africa’s most talented and promising fighter, but he has a tough assignment against Rakhimov (14-0; 11), the No. 5 IBF junior lightweight. The IBF do not list No. 1 and 2. Rakhimov, 25, made his pro debut on 6 December, 2015 and has won his last three fights in style with wins over former IBF junior lightweight champion Malcom Klassen (tko 8) from South Africa, Robinson Castellanos (tko 2) of Mexico and Maemu. The winner of this all-southpaw clash will qualify to meet IBF junior lightweight champion Tevin Farmer (30-4-1; 6) from Philadelphia, USA. Fuzile from the Eastern Cape, who fights out of Colin Nathan’s new Hotbox Gym, will have the backing of all South African boxing fans as he goes into possibly the biggest challenge in his boxing life. Credit must also be given to Promoter of the Year, Rumble Africa Promotions CEO Nomfesane Nyathela who, after lengthy negotiations, was able to bring the fight to East London. - SuperSport
