GLADAFRICA Championship side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila have suspended their coach Moma Medic with immediate effect. The Limpopo outfit released a short statement on their social media that Medic, who was Orlando Pirates assistant coach previously, was put aside due to the conflicts within the team. At the same time, TTM have placed Phuthi Mohaje, who is his assistant coach, “pending the outcome of the hearing”. SunSport sources say it is serious matter that the coach has transgressed and could find himself in the firing line. “At this point in time I can’t say what happened because this thing just happened,” said TTM CEO Sello Chokoe. This has come as a huge surprise to many. Medic, who joined the club in February, took the club to the Promotional play-offs in his short spell. But they were unsuccessful as they were beaten by Maritzburg United in the race, who in turned retained their PSL status. This season TTM have also started very and look well and truly to challenge for the title. They are third on the log with seven points from four games played. They are just one point behind log-leaders and surprised packages JDR Stars, who is tied on points with second-placed University of Pretoria.
