AFTER Khanya Kubhayi was shot two days before her birthday in 2015, she used to stay indoors as she hated going out in public. The 33-year-old from Salubindza Village , Mpumalanga, said she was depressed, scared and hadn’t accepted her condition. “I accompanied my friend to drop off the sound system before my birthday party. When we arrived at her house, three tsotsis pointed guns at us. They ordered us to give them our cellphones. “They told me to give them money. I had R2 000 I was supposed to deposit for my rent,” said Khanya. She said one of the tsotsis pushed her into the car while she was reaching for her handbag. He shot her in the shoulder and the bullet hit her spinal cord. “This led to me being quadriplegic. I don’t have full function of my hands and legs, but minimal function of my hands.” Khanya recently got her driver’s licence. “I used to have Code 10 licence and now it’s been adjusted to Code 8. I’ll drive an automatic adapted car with hand controls. This will bring back my independence,” said the former Pep store manager. “People living with a disability have the right to drive and be in accessible spaces.” Khanya said she was emotionally and physically ready after she met people in the same situation as her. “They proved to me that life goes on, even though one’s living with a disability. I’m also grateful to my family and friends for their continued support over the years.”
