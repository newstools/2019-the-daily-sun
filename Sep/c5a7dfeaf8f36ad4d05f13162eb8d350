If you should hazard a guess, what would you say are the
five best-selling vehicles of all time? The smart answer would probably be to trim it down into
segments and markets, but the overall list we have below will probably have you
raising an eyebrow. The vehicles in our list are no less than 40-years old and
these vehicles have proven themselves over many generations. Probably not much of a surprise is the Toyota Corolla, which
has, after more than fifty years, sold off more than 44.1-million units
worldwide. The latest, eleventh-generation iteration reached our shores earlier
this year. Which of these vehicles do you reckon will still sell large
numbers for years to come, and why? Email us your thoughts. Ford’s F-Series is the only bakkie on the list, but sold off
more than 40-million units since coming to market. It’s America’s most-popular
vehicle. Another South African favourite, the Volkswagen Golf, sold
33-million units over its seven generations of uninterrupted production and
will a new model arrive locally in 2020. It may not be as popular as it once was, but the Honda Civic
racked up sales in excess of 24-million units. It was also the car that
effectively saved the automaker from going bust. The fifth best-selling vehicle is the Volkswagen Passat. It
came to market in the 1970s, but really picked up momentum in the 90s. Though
they don’t sell in as many numbers as before, VW managed to sell 23-million
units to date.  SOURCE: WHEELS24
