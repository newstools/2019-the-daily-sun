A man was robbed of his Rolex watch at a McDonald's in Boksburg on Wednesday. According to police, the incident happened around noon.  Eyewitness Fernando Capao told News24 that he and his two children placed their order at about 11:30. "I was actually eyeing the table that he (the victim) went to go sit at," he recalled.    Capo said the men very casually walked in before one of them pulled out a knife. Police spokesperson Constable Justice Ramaube said one of the suspects held the knife to the victim’s neck, while the other grabbed his watch, valued at R50 000. A timestamp on the video shows that the robbery happened at about 11:50. "I just heard a bit of a commotion and I saw my daughter's eyes spring wide open," Capao said. "The knife was a huge knife. It definitely deterred people from assisting." He said the incident was over after about a minute.  "It crossed my mind to help the guy, but I just wanted to get my kids out of there," he said. Capao and his children, who were almost done eating, left immediately. Capao said that his son (11) and daughter (14) are okay after the incident. "It’s not something you want your kids to see or witness." Ramaube confirmed that a case of robbery had been opened at the Boksburg North police station. "Police are investigating the matter, but no arrests have been made so far," he said.
