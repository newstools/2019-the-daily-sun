ARTISTS and security guards got into a fist fight on Tuesday afternoon. It started when guards pushed artists waiting to speak to head of department, Ntshabeng Tsebe. It apparently happened at the Limpopo arts and culture department offices in Polokwane They wanted to discuss their involvement in department programmes. They said they’d open assault cases against officials and guards, claiming guns were pointed at them. Limpopo Arts and Culture Youth Forum chairman Freddy Molope told Daily Sun: “We’re ready to die or get arrested for fighting this evil system of capitalism. “I’ll not rest until artists are free from poverty. We’re concerned about the treatment our artists are getting from the department. “Various programmes across the province are not empowering up-and-coming artists.” Molope claimed only celebrities and tenderpreneurs benefitted from the programmes. “The province is hosting the Golden Shield Heritage Awards and Indigenous Games Festival without empowering local artists,” he told the People’s Paper. Department spokesman Lucky Tshilimandila said a meeting would be organised with all relevant stakeholders to find a solution to the artists’ complaints.
