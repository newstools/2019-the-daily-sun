 One person
has been arrested and almost 10 others are wanted for applying for traffic
documentation with fake visas, the Stellenbosch Municipality said in a
statement on Monday. The
suspects arrived on different dates since July to the Driving Licence Testing
Centre to apply for various documents. Before
assisting them, their visas were sent to the Department of Home Affairs for
verification, but they came back to the testing centre as fake. One of the
applicants was arrested by police when he returned to the office. Police said
they were on the lookout for the rest. "The
charges include fraud, being in possession of falsified visas and illegal entry
into the Republic of South Africa," the statement said. They would
also be flagged on the National Traffic Information System and will be blocked
from all driving or vehicle licence-related transactions countrywide. Stellenbosch
mayor Gesie van Deventer said the discovery was due to the vigilance and
cooperation of all officials involved, from police, home affairs, the
department of transport and the testing centre officials. Western
Cape police spokesperson Siyabulela Malo said the sting operation was conducted
on Friday. SOURCE:
