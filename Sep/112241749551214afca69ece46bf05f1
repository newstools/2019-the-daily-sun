Nomnikelo (29) and her husband Thomas Kubone (37) from Westonaria started the Academy FC. This after they were worried about the young ones in the area. “The aim of the academy is to train children to be independent, fit and understand the importance of healthy living,” said Thomas. They meet at a local park after school to do different exercises. Said Nomnikelo: “Exercising doesn’t only result in a healthy body, but you also get a healthy mind.” Cindy Glass, owner and co-founder of the Step Up Education Centre agrees. She said being physically fit keeps one free from any ailment. According to Nomnikelo children face many challenges as they grow up. “Children have to learn to be resilient. And nothing prepares them better than sport activities,” she said. Cindy said resilient children are more adaptable, have greater courage and are more curious when facing the world around them. She encouraged parents to help children to face whatever life throws at them. Let them know that you too have gone through some these emotions and that you are there to support and encourage them. ) Acknowledge and own the tough-stuff: Non-judgmental communication is important in building trust and self-esteem.
