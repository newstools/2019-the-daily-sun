It’s no secret that rappers love to spend their money on
luxury material things. American rapper Travis Scott recently bought himself a new
expensive car. According to TMZ, Travis bought a white 2018 Maybach G650
Landaulet, an extreme rare G-wagon that costs $1.6 million (Close to R24
million).   There are only 99 Landaulets cars that Maybach has produced.
Travis customized his with brown interior and includes a mini fridge. The rapper has had a successful year from his Astroworld
album tour and the release of his Netflix documentary, “Look Mom I can Fly.”. ???? A post shared by  flame (@travisscott) on Sep 14, 2019 at 5:11pm PDT
