Two suspects aged 34 and 43 were nabbed after attempting to bribe police officials in Musina. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said it is alleged that two men approached the police officers at the Vehicle Investigation Unit and offered them thousands of rand in bribery. He said in return, they were hoping to retrieve two cars that were seized by police, during a sting operation that was conducted a week ago. Ngoepe said these vehicles, were confiscated on 1 July 2019, after police followed a tip-off about a group of criminals allegedlyÂ  enroute from Gauteng to Makhado area. The criminals were arrested for possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles. During the process, they recovered two motor vehicles believed to be stolen, eight station signal jammers, monitors used to control alarm system, angle grinder wheels, drill, balaclavas and hand gloves. The two suspects will appear before Musina Magistrate's Court soon, facing charges of bribery. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, commended these members for displaying an exemplary conduct of fighting corruption head on.
