DANIEL AKPEYI might not have been too convincing between the sticks for Kaizer Chiefs last season, but has had no such troubles for Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) so far. The former Chippa Unitedshot-stopper has received some criticism from Amakhosi faithful for some of his performances. But this has not affected his form for the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has entrusted the 32-year-old with the number one jersey, an opportunity he has grabbed with both hands. Akpeyi has played all but one of the Super Eagles’ games – which was their dead rubber against Madagascar in the group stages. Akpeyi, who has a few blunders under his belt in the PSL, has so far repaid the faith shown in him by producing solid performances for the Super Eagles. He has kept two clean sheets in the four matches he’s played in the tournament. He helped the Super Eagles beat familiar opponents Bafana Bafana 2-1 in the quarter-finals midweek to book a spot in the last four. They will now face Algeria at the Cairo International Stadium this evening at 9pm. “I’m only playing to get an opportunity to play every game and am grateful to the coach,” said Akpeyi. “Against all odds and against all the media trying to pull me down he’s given me a chance.” Akpeyi will need to be at the top of his game again tonight when they face a dangerous Algeria outfit who beat the Ivory Coast 4-3 on penalties to progress to the semis. The Desert Foxes will pin their hopes on star duo Reyad Mahrez and Sofiane Feghouli to deliver them their first Afcon title in nearly 30 years. But Nigeria, who are aiming to reach their first Afcon final since 2013 when it was staged in South Africa, will do enough to get past the Desert Foxes. Rohr has entrusted the likes of youngsters Samuel Chukwueze, Alex Iwobi and Moses Simon among others carry them to their fourth Afcon title.
