MAMORENA Letsholo’s family have been having nightmares since her grandson was found dead. Earlier this month, 20-month-old Botshelo Molete’s body was found inside a freezer outside a church. The 51-year-old gogo from Orange Grove in Thabong kasi, outside Welkom in the Free State, was left traumatised after the discovery at the Twelve Apostolic Church in New Stance. The child had gone missing a week earlier. Pastor Matseleng Koloane (60) said the discovery had come as a shock. Botshelo went missing while her mum Nthabiseng (23) was helping out at the church. Mamorena, whose son was Botshelo’s father, said: “The funeral was on Thursday and it went well, thanks to the help of residents. My son and his wife are unemployed.” She said her daughter Kelebohile (18) had dreamt of an old woman choking and smashing the boy’s head on the ground. Mamorena said she was worried the dreams might affect her grade 11 daughter’s schoolwork. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana said they were still waiting for post mortem results to establish how Botshelohad died.
