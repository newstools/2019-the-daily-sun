BUDDING boxing trainer Harry Ramogoadi-Manaka has advised fellow local mentors to equip themselves with necessary professional skills if they want to survive in modern boxing world. The former boxer, who spent nine years plying his trade in England, opened a boxing gym in the Benoni central business district in November last year to plough back to his community. The former Commonwealth junior featherweight contender mentors about 14 professional boxers and amateurs from the age of six upwards at his training facility. According to Ramogoadi-Manaka, the local trainers have to move with the times if they want to survive because boxing is evolving. He said there is more to training facility than doing pads and showing boxers how to fight. “Box exercises is a new and big phenomenal. This business model will sustain a trainer during hard times, especially when their fighters don’t earn money in the ring. It will also minimise the hopping of boxers from one trainer to another,” he said. “The local trainers think it’s all about getting a place to train youngsters. It can be that but there is more to fitness business if they want to succeed.” The passionate trainer said it has been his wish to transfer his boxing skills to aspiring fighters, and he is happy that he’s living that dream. One of his charges, Siyabonga “Silent Assassin” Siyo, will challenge for the IBF international junior flyweight held by Sivenathi “Special One” Nontshinga at Orient Theatre on 28 July. “It was always my plan to invest my skills back to the youngsters once my fighting days were over. I’m sure everyone who was a fighter had that ambition, unless there is something that pushed off against that. I think I’m a teacher and student of sport. I understand boxing and that helped me to make an easy transition,” he explained.
