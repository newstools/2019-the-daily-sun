Police in Gauteng strongly condemn the incidents of violence directed at state property and property of the innocent citizens as a result of protests for electricity blackouts and other service delivery concerns. This follows the damages, deconstructions of private vehicles  and serious and violent crimes including rape at the Klipspruit Valley Road last night by residents in the area as a result of electricity blackout. Police are also appealing to the members of the public who might have been injured to come forward. Several cases including malicious damage to property, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, rape and public violence are being investigated. It is suspected that more than 20 motorists were affected including a woman who became a victim of rape. “Criminals who operates as protesters  with the intention of terrorizing the members of the community,  once caught,  will face the full might of the law”, says the Provincial Commissioner of Gauteng Lieutenant General Elias Mawela. The commissioner  is highly concerned about the violence directed at innocent citizens and  also appeals to the affected authorities to attend to the community concerns as soon as they become aware in order to minimize these acts of violence. Police are also appealing to anyone who might have knowledge about these criminals who attacked motorists to come forward. Information may anonymously be forwarded to Crime Stop at 08600 10111 at all hours. Any information that may lead to the arrest of the perpetrators may be rewarded.
