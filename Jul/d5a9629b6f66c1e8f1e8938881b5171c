EVEN though one of his legs has been amputated, he can perform tasks many able-bodied people can’t. Mlungisi Xaba refuses to be labelled and put down because of his disability. The 37-year-old self-employed builder from Umlazi, south of Durban, uses his crutches to walk to work. But he throws them away as soon he gets there and start laying bricks and mixing dough. He is well-known in the kasi and has customers all over KZN. He lost his leg in 2008 while working for a construction company in Joburg in what he suspects to have been the result of evil deeds. He moved back to Umlazi in 2014 to start his own business. Mlungisi is a jack of all trades. He can draw house plans, lay bricks, plaster walls and construct roofs. “I think I’m blessed. There is nothing I can’t do if I want to do it. I have a family and kids and live a good life. I go to the beach and swim with my family,” he said. Mlungisi said his only challenge was that some people doubted his abilities because of his disability. They even refusd to pay him a deposit. He said some customers wanted him to finish a house before they paid him.
