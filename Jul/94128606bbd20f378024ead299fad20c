Singer, songwriter and Poet Beatrice Akuvi Hosen Kumordzie whose stage name is Akuvi gives neo-soul music a new meaning. The Norwegian-Ghanaian soulful music draws contemporary RnB and Hip Hop, bringing societal issues into light. Akuvi grew up in a creative family which set the tone for her passion and love for music. “I was always at the forefront either expressing myself through explosive hip hop dancing or singing soulful tones.” Through pursuing studies of peace, conflict, and religion, the vocalist was inspired to move to the vibrant city Cape Town, a city that therefore inspired her musical journey. She has made appearances on the expresso show and has released her music video for song Free me From me, inspired by observing human behavior. “We are constantly searching for answers and ways to numb the anxieties that uncertainty brings”. Akuvi will be baring her soul at the Oslo Afro Arts Festival in August and is working on putting an EP together featuring artist from South Africa, Ghana and Norway. Watch her music video below:
