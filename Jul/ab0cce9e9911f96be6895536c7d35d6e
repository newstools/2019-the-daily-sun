BANYANA Banyana got their Cosafa Women’s Championship title defence off to a flying start. They pummeled poor Comoros Islands 17-0 in their tournament opener at Wolfson Stadium in the windy City of Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. Captain for the day Refilwe Jane scored four goals while striker Amanda Mthandi bagged a hat-trick as rampant Banyana dished out a footballing lesson to the Islanders. Hilda Magaia and Bambanani Mbane netted braces each while Tiisetso Makhubela, Ode Fulutudilu, Mamello Makhabane, Busiswe Ndimeni and Kholosa Biyana scored the other goals. There was also an unfortunate own goal from Comoros defender Hanifa Melanie. This was not the first Banyana humiliated the Islanders. They crushed them 13-0 in the Women's Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in 2014. Banyana, who were the only team from the Cosafa region to take part at the FIFA Women’s World Cup staged in France, showed their quality and would dominate the tie from the first to the final whistle. Their resounding victory sent a strong message to the rest of their competitors and signaled their intent for their third Cosafa title on the trot. Desiree Ellis’s charges broke Zimbabwe’s 19-year-old goal-scoring record of 15 goals in a single match which they set in April 2002 against Lesotho. @Banyana_Banyana have once again done the nation proud with a 17-0 victory against Comoros! What an outstanding way to open their COSAFA Cup campaign! Congratulations to Player Of The Match, Captain Refiloe Jane who scored us 4 goals in this game. Well done girls! #COSAFAWC ???? pic.twitter.com/oaSyTmqm7V
