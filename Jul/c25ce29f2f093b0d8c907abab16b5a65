Toyota Hilux’s nameplate has obtained legendary status globally. And since its first launch in Mzansi back in 1969 it has firmly rooted itself in the local motor landscape and become the best-selling bakkie. As a tribute to Hilux’s success and rich heritage, Toyota South Africa first created a bespoke limited edition model aptly named Legend 35 in 2004. It was followed by the Legend 40, built on the global IMV platform, and Legend 45 in 2009 and 2014 respectively. The Legend 45 model was well-received. Therefore the time for a new Legend has arrived – to celebrate 50 years of local Hilux. Welcome Legend 50! Several special design tweaks have been made on the new model. The Legend 50 now boasts the front upper and lower grille, with matching stylised fog-lamp surrounds. A stylish silver accent line frames – the vertical fog-lights garnish with matching silver lower bumper guard.  Other features include the Legend 50’s badge, black side protective mouldings, chrome exterior mirrors and door handles and black side steps. A customised rear styling bar with matching Legend 50 badging and a textured, heavy-duty tonneau cover add that rugged appeal.  In the rear, a black rear bumper, smoked tail lamps and tailgate badging complete the visual package. It comes with two-tone 18-inch alloy wheels. Inside, it has black leather trimming with blue perforation and stitching, a stylish chrome accent strip runs across the dashboard, offset by gloss-black panel trim. Branded silver door scuff plates and carpet set lend both a protective and aesthetic hand. The Legend 50 replicates itself in Raider models across all three body shapes: single-, Xtra- and double-cab.
