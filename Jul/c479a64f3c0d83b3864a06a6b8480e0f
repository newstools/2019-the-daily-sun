LOCALS want murder accused Julius Mndawe (25) to rot in jail, failing which they threatened to deal with him. On Sunday residents of Numbi, near the Kruger National Park in Mpumalanga, heard that three bodies had been exhumed from shallow graves in Mndawe’s back yard. Two bodies had been found earlier. Neighbour Lizzy Masuku (72) said Mndawe looked like a loafer and she sometimes heard strange sounds coming from his house. Locals said they’d see him drinking at taverns but he never spoke. Mndawe handed himself over to police earlier this month following the murder of five young women aged between 15 and 24. He allegedly suffocated and buried them in his yard, and raped some of them. Sipho Masango (36) told Daily Sun: “We want to deal with him.” Minah Nsumbe (45) said Mndawe had confessed that more girls were missing. “He must help cops find them,” she said. Mndawe, whose house was torched by angry residents, is facing five counts of murder, violation of a corpse, concealment of a body, rape and other charges. People plan to march to court tomorrow to oppose bail. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi urged them to not take the law into their own hands.
