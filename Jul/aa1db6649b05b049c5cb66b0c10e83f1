SENIOR ANC member Derek Hanekom and the SACP have admitted talking to opposition parties to remove then president Jacob Zuma from office. This plot to remove Zuma by the ANC and alliance, as well as the EFF, first came to light when Julius Malema hit back at Hanekom for calling them a fascist organisation. Malema said Hanekom approached the EFF to help remove Zuma in a motion of no confidence in the National Assembly. Malema said SACP first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila was part of those efforts. In an SMS, Hanekom told Daily Sun yesterday he had met EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee, on Gardee’s invitation. “I met Gardee. Nothing wrong with that. I was part of two attempts in 2017 to persuade Zuma to step down, and the NEC finally made the decision to force him to step down,” he wrote. SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo said Mapaila was sent to lead a campaign to get rid of Zuma. “The SACP strongly condemns any suggestion that it was a conspiracy,” he said.
