CHURCH members on Saturday described Bishop Zwelakhe Mzimela as a committed man of God. The founder of KwaMashu Christian Centre, north of Durban, died of kidney failure last week and was buried on the church premises on Saturday. The funeral was attended by politicians such as Police Minister Bheki Cele, Premier Sihle Zikalala and eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede. However, some residents were shocked to learn the bishop was buried on the premises. Nana Dube (29) said it made many people suspicious. “Several pastors have died but were buried in normal graves. “There must be a reason why they did this. It’s not just about honouring his wishes,” she said. Speaking on behalf of the church, Pastor Mthetheleli Zulu said it was the bishop’s wish to be buried on the church premises. “People will always talk. But when white people do things like this, they don’t say anything. When the same thing is done by a black person, they talk negatively,” said Zulu. He said none of the bishop’s children or other family members would be buried on the church premises. Addressing mourners, Zikalala said: “When communities were being devastated by Aids, which was creating many orphans, it was the Mzimela family that established the Bonginkosi Creche and Preschool to care for innocent children in 1995.” He said the bishop’s family also contributed to the struggle.
