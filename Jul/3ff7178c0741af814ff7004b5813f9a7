MOST people are disgusted by cockroaches and try to kill them. However, a recent study released by Purdue University in the US found this might become harder to do. They found evidence that German cockroaches were becoming more difficult to kill. Sadly, of the three species found in South Africa, German cockroaches are the most common. Scientist Michael Scharf wrote in the study: “Cockroaches developing resistance to multiple classes of insecticides at once will make controlling these pests almost impossible with chemicals alone. “We would see resistance increase four or six-fold in just one generation. We didn’t have a clue that something like that could happen this fast.” SunReaders were asked on Facebook how they killed cockroaches in their homes.
