ANOTHER Gauteng school has become the scene of a violent attack. Two pupils escaped death yesterday after they were shot and wounded at MH Joosub Technical Secondary School in Lenasia, south of Joburg. One of the victims, aged 19, is being treated at a local hospital after being wounded in the right leg. The second victim, an 18-year-old boy, had a bullet graze his leg. Three suspects were arrested in connection with the shooting, the latest in a long list of violent incidents in and around Gauteng schools. It is unclear what sparked yesterday’s shooting, but cops are investigating. Terrified pupils were told to go home in the wake of the incident. The Gauteng Education Department sent a psycho social unit to support the staff and pupils as well the victims and their families. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi welcomed the arrests. “We welcome the arrests of the pupils implicated. This is a sign of the co-operation agreement with the police to attend to these kinds of acts happening closer to our schools,” said Panyaza. Samoodien Pandor, a resident, was metres away when the incident happened. “I saw a pupil pull out a gun and shoot a fellow pupil. He then handed over the gun to a driver of a scholar transport vehicle and the driver left with it.” Gauteng provincial police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed three pupils were arrested and released into the custody of their parents. They are expected to appear in court soon. “A 7.65 pistol with six rounds of ammunition was seized at the home of one of the suspects,” he said.
