BABY Mirla Chauke was normal when she was born two years ago. But when she was four months old, she developed a rare skin condition. Her mum Thina (39) from Jabulani in Soweto, said the child’s skin started to get dry and peel off her face. She said Mirla had been in and out of hospital since then and has been given sunscreen, medicated bath soap and aqueous cream to help cure her skin. Thina said Mirla couldn’t play in the sun and her face was full of cracks. The cracks ooze blood and pus. She said the child’s condition was made worse when she woke up in the middle of the night to scratch her face. “I can’t even take her anywhere because when I get into the taxi, people talk behind my back and make me cry.” Thina said she couldn’t enrol her at any creche as she feared that other children would be frightened of her condition. A doctor said the condition was known as xeroderma pigmentosum, which was a genetic sensitivity to the sun. She said this meant Mirla would easily develop skin cancer. She said the child needed genetic testing and counselling. Maryna De Beer of the Xeroderma Pigmentosum Society said something could still be done to prevent further skin damage. She said there were only about 1 000 people in the world with the condition. The society will help Thina care for her toddler’s skin.
