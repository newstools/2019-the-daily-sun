BONOKUHLE Blose’s family home was damaged by a truck that crashed into it several years ago. The 25-year-old from Mhlumayo in Ladysmith, KZN, said her family wanted the Alfred Duma Municipality to fix the house. Bonokuhle said they never got hold of the company after the truck crashed into their house when it collided with a bakkie in 2015. “The truck veered off the road, knocked down a child, injured several others, and crashed into our home,” she said. “We took down the driver’s contact number and he promised to assist us. “However, we couldn’t get hold of him later. “We got no response to emails we sent to the company.” Bonokuhle said the doors were also broken and none of them worked, and they couldn’t fix the house. Municipal spokesman Siyabonga Maphalala told Daily Sun he had forwarded the matter to the relevant department. Maphalala said he was waiting for a response.
