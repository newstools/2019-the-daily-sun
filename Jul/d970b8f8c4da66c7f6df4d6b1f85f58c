SYDWELL Silemela was excited when he went to draw the money he had received for a painting job. But his excitement turned to terror when three armed men approached him at the gate of his house in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, and robbed him of the money he had worked so hard for. The 60-year-old told Daily Sun he went to Daveyton Mall on Thursday to withdraw R13 000 he was supposed to share with three other men for a job they had done together. He said when he got to his gate, the three men pounced. “I was broken by the attack but I had no choice. I had to hand over the cash to save my life,” he said. Sydwell said after taking his money, the thugs fled the scene. “I wish we had done the payments through EFT and not with hard cash,” he said. His wife Florence (53) said she suspected the men followed them from the ATM. “How else would they know how much money we had?” she asked. Her advice to others was to always use EFTs when dealing with large amounts of cash. “You never know whether it’s an inside job at the bank or if someone knew you were going to withdraw money. I really hope the cops find these thugs and deal with them,” she said. Daveyton police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe confirmed a case of robbery was opened for investigation. He warned resident to be careful when withdrawing large amounts of money.
