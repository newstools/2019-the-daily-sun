RAMATSEME Petja’s been struggling to cope since her 17-year-old son Botshelo was shot dead during a protest. The 41-year-old mum from Ga-Mphahlele, Limpopo, said she spent the days since his death on Wednesday locked in her bedroom crying. She said she couldn’t understand why guards at Dithabaneng Mining in Sefalaolo Village shot live ammunition at protesters. “My son will not come back but his killer might be released on bail,” Ramatseme said. Ramatseme said Botshelo’s dream was to become a doctor one day. He was shot dead while protesting against the mining company, alongside other residents, for removing chrome from the ground illegally. The grade 11 pupil hid in the bushes after being shot in the stomach. His uncle Penebese Petja (44) took him to Lebowakgomo Hospital where he died. Penebese told Daily Sun: “Those people claiming to be guards were just shooting at people randomly.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the 26-year-old guard was bust on Thursday and charged with murder. “The suspect briefly appeared before the Lebowakgomo Magistrates Court. The matter was postponed to today for a formal bail application,” he said.
