AT LEAST 18 people were killed in five crashes on Mpumalanga roads over the weekend. In the first crash, three people were killed instantly in a collision involving 17 vehicles. It happened on the N12 road between Emalahleni and Delmas on Friday. The dead included the driver of one of the 10 sedans and a two-year-old. The three were reportedly travelling from Joburg to the Kruger National Park when the sedan they were travelling in collided with two trucks . It is not clear what led to the crash. No injuries were recorded. Misty conditions were suspected to have led to the crash. It’s believed a bakkie collided with the trailer of a vehicle which was approaching from the opposite direction. The bakkie then collided head-on with a truck. All seven victims were occupants of the bakkie. Mpumalanga community safety spokesman Moeti Mmusi urged motorists to drive safely “We urge motorists to work with the government to curb road carnages,” he said.
