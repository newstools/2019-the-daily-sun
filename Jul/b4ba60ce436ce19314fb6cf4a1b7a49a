RESIDENTS have joined people from other parts of the country and are crying out for better services. This comes at a time when the municipality faces a housing shortage and locals have been vandalising RDPs. Some of the unoccupied houses in Kuwait in Port elizabeth are even turned into dumps and thieves’ hideouts. According to Sanco, the municipality is mostly to blame. Provincial leader Siphiwo Dayimani said: “We’re fighting vandalism and they’re just watching and doing nothing. “In Motherwell NU29, over 50 new RDPs were vandalised. Doors, windows and bricks were removed.” Dayimani said one person was even killed while vandalising a house. “We’d arrest criminals with the help of a private security company, but the municipality didn’t renew its contract. “We decided to put people on the RDP housing list, but instead of supporting us the municipality threatened to arrest us. It accused us of invading RDPs.” Dayimani said it was painful to see taxpayers’ money going down the drain. “These houses have become thugs’ dens, places where teenagers smoke dagga and all sorts of other drugs. ‘This is happening, even though hundreds of people need houses.” Human settlements spokesman Masiza Mazizi told the People’s Paper: “Obviously, vandalised houses are a huge cost to government as they have to be rectified or rebuilt when a new beneficiary has been identified. “At application stage, the department encourages municipalities to have already identified the beneficiary of the specific sites and, where possible, they should ensure the beneficiary is on his or her site when construction starts. “For every project where construction is about to start, project steering committees are set up, comprising the beneficiary community.  This is meant to avoid issues like these.”
