TRIBUTES poured in after news broke that Sam Meyiwa had died. Sam, father of late Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa, had always wanted justice for his murdered son. Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Ntokozo Sikhakhane organised a Senzo Meyiwa walk last year. He also hosted a commemoration match. All proceeds went to the family. Sikhakhane said: “Senzo’s father was like my father. There were so many things we planned to do together to continue Senzo’s legacy. “I also planned a tournament for September. I’m so sad for Senzo’s mum as she’s now all alone.” Legendary coach Mlungisi “Professor” Ngubane said he was devastated. Senzo’s former teammate at Pirates, Rooi Mahamutsa, said: “It’s the first time I’m hearing these terrible news.” The EFF also sent its condolences. “Baba Meyiwa passed on before receiving justice for his murdered, talented son Senzo. Our police have failed to bring him comfort.” Social media users sent their condolences.
