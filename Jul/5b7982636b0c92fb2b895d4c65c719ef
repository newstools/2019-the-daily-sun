Cape Town law enforcement officers who helped a woman chase
down a man, who had allegedly stolen her bag, ended up arresting both of them
when they found out what was inside. Members attached to the anti-land invasion reaction unit
rushed to Olifant Street in Delft on Monday after they were told that people
were being robbed there, according to law enforcement spokesperson Wayne
Dyason. Officers found a woman chasing a man. "The officers joined the chase and apprehended him. He
was in possession of a white bag which the officers assumed was the property of
the female who chased after him," said Dyason. When they opened the bag, they found 10 parcels of dagga
inside. "The bemused officers turned to the suspect who said he
robbed the female of the bag and was unaware of its contents." Both were arrested and taken to the Delft police station.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/joint-operation-cops-help-woman-chase-man-who-stole-her-bag-only-to-find-10-parcels-of-dagga-inside-20190730
