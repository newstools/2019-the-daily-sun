TAXIMEN have been accused of hacking a pupil with a bush knife during a school boycott yesterday. Attwell Madala High School pupils representative Hlalanathi Mnende (18) said: “A pupil was hacked with a bush knife and pupils fought back. A taxi almost ran the pupils over.” It happened when a taxi tried to drive through the protesting pupils. Mnende said cops fired teargas and live ammunition during the boycott, held to force the education department to build a new school. SGB chairman Ndoyisile Fudumele said: “We’re in a meeting with the pupils’ leaders and the department to find a way forward.” Fudumele said the department had in the past promised to build a new school. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said officials were sent to the school to listen to pupils’ grievances. The department had plans to build a school. Mnende said: “The classrooms are not conducive to learning and they leak in the rainy season.” Captain Dineo Koena denied that cops used live ammunition. She said a 19-year-old girl was hacked while a 19-year-old boy was hit by a rubber bullet. “We use rubber bullets to disperse violent rioters,” she said. “If it’s found that live ammunition was used, then that person can open an attempted murder case and Ipid will investigate.” Koena said cases of public violence and malicious damage to property were opened. She said no arrests had been made yet.
