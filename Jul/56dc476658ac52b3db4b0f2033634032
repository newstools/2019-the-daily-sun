Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema claims that
the party leadership has "hardcore evidence" that there is a plan to
assassinate the deputy president of the party, Floyd Shivambu. "There is an intelligence report by crime intelligence
which confirms that Floyd Shivambu is the subject of a target and they've even
identified the person who has procured the killing of Floyd Shivambu," said
Malema in a media briefing on Thursday. "Till today, the (police) minister has got the report,
till today nothing has happened. There is a price tag on Floyd's head. The
assassin went to Floyd. We reported the matter to the minister, crime intelligence
has investigated, it is confirmed and they even know the person." Malema, not giving away too much info contained in the
purported intelligence report continued that "the person owns hotels in
Natal, he's an Indian who has given instruction for the deputy president of the
EFF to be killed". Malema doubled down, reiterating his claims saying that
"these people have put a price tag on Floyd. An Indian owner of hotels in
Umhlanga has put a price tag on Floyd's name. "Minister of Police [Bheki Cele has] intelligence
compiled [on] the person who has given instruction is identified. He's got the
report, he's sitting on it. "We are waiting for Floyd to be killed."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/there-is-a-price-tag-on-floyds-head-malema-claims-assassination-plot-20190718
