 EKURHULENI cops arrested eleven suspects and recovered over six unlicensed firearms and 160 rounds of bullets. The arrests were made following the murder and two attempted murders in Ekurhuleni on Sunday. It is alleged that a gang of armed men shot at four men who were standing next to a Toyota Conquest in Katlehong, Emlotheni Informal Settlement. “One of the victims died at the scene, two were taken to hospital in a serious condition and the fourth victim managed to run away. “An Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Officer who saw the suspects fleeing from the scene gave chase and apprehended one of the suspects. More police officers responded, and the second suspect was spotted.” Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said. Masondo said the suspect started shooting at the police as they were approaching him, and police returned fire. He was wounded and taken to hospital under police guard and an unlicensed firearm was recovered. According to Masondo, the search for the remaining suspects led the police to Nguni Hostel in Vosloorus on Monday. “Nine hostel dwellers were found in one of the rooms. Upon searching the suspects and the room, police found five unlicensed firearms and over one hundred and sixty live ammunition of AK47, shotgun, Torus 9mm and revolvers,” Masondo said. The suspects were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Masondo said investigations are underway to establish if these suspects can be linked to other serious and violent crimes, including the recent murders at the hostels in Ekurhuleni.
