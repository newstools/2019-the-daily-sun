A MAN was arrested with R107 300 in fong kong money on Wednesday. The 49-year-old from Botshabelo, Mangaung, was apparently turned in by residents after they heard him bragging about how much money he had. Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma said: “The suspect was arrested and charged with possession of counterfeit money. “This comes after the Selosesha tactical response team and crime intelligence cluster acted on information. “Police found counterfeit money amounting to R1 400 hidden in shoes on top of a wardrobe. The suspect was interrogated and upon being searched, police found R300 in counterfeit money in his possession. “A thorough search continued inside and outside the house and police found more counterfeit notes valued at R105 900 wrapped in a black refuse bag hidden in an outside toilet. “The suspect is expected to appear before the Botshabelo Magistrates Court soon.” Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe praised cops for their hard work and advised business owners to check whether the money they received was real.
