The water supply in Ntabankulu, Alfred Nzo Municipality in the Eastern Cape, was closed on Saturday after protesters allegedly poisoned the town’s water supply. “This follows vandalism of the bulk pipeline from Ntabankulu Dam. The municipality has suspended the water supply to Ntabankulu until laboratory tests are completed,” said municipal spokesman Lubabalo Majenge. “We would like to thank the community for being patient while we deal with this situation.” He said if water still came out of the taps, people shouldn’t drink it. Municipal trucks will fill the water tanks installed for drought relief,” he said. The municipality delivered water to the people by truck. A borehole was also activated on Monday. Ntabankulu municipal spokesman Lixolile Petela said the water will be turned off until samples sent for testing come back. Test results were expected yesterday afternoon. “A few angry community members have been burning tyres and the education department offices were burned down last week. “It is hard to tell if this incident is linked to these protests,” he said. The protests last week came after the municipality demolished 81 houses in Ndakeni Village. They were erected illegally on land for which the Amanci Traditional Council has put in a land claim. Alfred Nzo district municipality is relieved after the results of water that was tested for poison came back. Spokesman Lubabalo Majenge said the lab results found no poison or any hazardous chemical on both Ntabankulu Dam and Ntabankulu Water Treatment works. “As a precautionary measure we closed water treatment works that supply water in Ntabankulu and surrounding villages after allegations of suspicious poisoning. The allegations followed the vandalising of the bulk pipeline to the treatment works by alleged protesting people. The treatment works will remain closed until the bulk pipeline is repaired. The backup borehole will continue with water supply” he said
