DNA tests have confirmed Khanyi Dube (32) gave birth to a baby girl but she insisted she had a son who was swapped in hospital. Khanyi from Gingindlovu, northern KZN, delivered the baby at home earlier this month with the help of her aunt and gogos. Khanyi said her aunt said she gave birth to a boy and she saw the baby before being taken to Catherine Booth Hospital. Khanyi told Daily Sun she thought this is a way to protect the hospital from being accused of stealing her baby boy. She said she would have a private test done. “After receiving the results I was discharged and left the baby there,” she said. Khanyi’s aunt Nomusa said they believed the hospital was hiding the truth. “Eight women, including the mum, can’t be wrong,” she said. The baby was still in hospital. Khanyi went into labour while only seven months pregnant. Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “The department received the DNA results, which confirm the baby is indeed the mother’s biolgical child.”
