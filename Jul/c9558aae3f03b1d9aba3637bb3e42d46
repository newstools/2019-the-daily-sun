THE Soweto derby is war and we are ready to go for the kill! With this bold declaration, new Kaizer Chiefs striker Lazalous Kambole has practically thrown the gauntlet to Orlando Pirates ahead of the Black Label Cup on Saturday. But his bravado-laced statement goes further than the keenly-awaited one-day Cup match. Kambole wants to change the fortunes of Amakhosi in the new season. The Zambian forward was one of the four players officially unveiled by the club in last night. “Kaizer Chiefs is a big club with a rich history, ” said Kambole. ”In the last four seasons they haven’t won a trophy. Of course, that’s a big challenge for me. I had offers from Belgium, Angola, Congo and from another team also in SA. But it was easy for me to choose Chiefs.” Kambole is excited at the prospect of playing in the derby. “We are going for the kill on Saturday,” said a bullish Kambole. “It’s humbling to be voted into the team for the Black Label Cup.” Serbian striker Samir Nurkovic echoed Kambole, acknowledging the pressure on them to help the club bring back the glory days. But he is not oblivious to the challenge he faces, having to adjust to a new environment. It is the same for James Kotei, the Ghanaian midfielder, who has excelled for Tanzanian side Simba. Koteo rates the Caf Champions League highly and wants to help Amakhosi qualify for the continental tournament. But he, too, is fully aware of the pressure that comes with donning the gold and black. Unlike Kearyn Baccus, the Durban-born but Australia-raised, Kotei has an idea of the PSL, having followed the local league on TV. ”The PSL is strong, competitive. It’ll be good to see Chiefs back in the Champions League, ” said Kotei. Amakhosi are back home from their excursion in Botswana to prepare for the big clash against their Soweto rivals at FNB Stadium.
