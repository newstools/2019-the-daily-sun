A MOTORIST has taken a video of a cop apparently trying to attack her and telling her she’s full of shit. Mapatsa Lesibu (36) claimedthe Metro cop kicked and pepper sprayed her on Saturday. She said she was travelling with her boyfriend and her mum in Randfontein, when he stopped them. Her boyfriend was driving. “We gave him both our licences and he asked what he must do with mine. I said my boyfriend has a learner’s. “He told me to shut up and told my boyfriend he’d write him a ticket for driving with a passenger. “He said if he wanted it cancelled, he must follow him to his car. I refused.” Mapatsa said the cop sat with the licence in his car for 20 minutes. “Then he threatened to cancel it. We got out to speak to his colleagues, and he started swearing at us. I then started taking the video.” She said the cop’s colleagues and her mum pulled the cop away. Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said their internal affairs unit was investigating. Captain Kay Makhubela said a case of assault has been opened.
