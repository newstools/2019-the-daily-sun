GAUTENG Premier David Makhura and Health MEC Bandile Masuku made surprise visits to health facilities yesterday. During their visits to Leratong Hospital and Krugersdorp Central Clinic in Mogale City, they spoke to patients. Patients at Leratong told Makhura they were happy with the service. Masuku said he’d be spending more time at the front line to interact with the public. “We caught everybody off-guard but from what we’ve seen, the patients seem satisfied,” Masuku said. Makhura said he was surprised by the level of satisfaction as most complaints government received were about the healthcare system. At the clinic, there were a few complaints, which included understaffing. Patients said they had to wait for many hours because there was only one person taking vital signs at the clinic. Clinic operational manager Sindi Mongae said: “There is one station with two enrolled nurses. If we could have two stations, our lives would be better.”
