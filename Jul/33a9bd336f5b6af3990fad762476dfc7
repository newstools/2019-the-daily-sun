South Africa’s largest mobile operators believe data prices could start falling once the government releases additional spectrum from next month.  In his State of the Nation Address (SONA) two weeks ago, president Cyril Ramaphosa said the state will start a process to release spectrum by August after repeatedly missing earlier deadlines.   Mobile operators have long blamed the lack of spectrum for the country’s high data prices which are some of the most expensive in the world. Spectrum refers to the radio frequencies needed for cellphone companies to transmit data - they can't transmit wireless signals over the same frequencies in the same markets at the same time. These frequencies are also used by TV and GPS. But in South Africa, spectrum is limited because television broadcasting is still hogging frequencies. The move from analogue TV system to digital terrestrial television would help free up spectrum. This was supposed to have happened in 2012. However, government has missed its own deadlines for this “digital migration” year after year.

This spectrum band is called the "digital dividend", “Having to build a 4G network that uses spectrum other than the ‘digital dividend’ means that we have had to needlessly build significantly more towers,” a spokesperson told Business Insider South Africa.       Vodacom has warned that government conditions as part of the sale could result in even higher data prices.  Also, O’Sullivan cautioned that other factors - including the exchange rate, inputs costs such as electricity and fuel, and theft and vandalism of cellphone towers - also have an effect on data prices.
