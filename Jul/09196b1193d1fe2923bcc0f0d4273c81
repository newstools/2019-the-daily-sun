RESIDENTS of Sinqawunqawini squatter camp are reeling in shock after three people were shot dead on Tuesday. Community leader Lindikhaya Mana said people in the squatter camp in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, heard gunshots but were too scared to go out.s “It’s dangerous to go out because you might also get killed,” he said. Lindikhaya said there had been several murders in the area recently. “Earlier this week, a man was stabbed to death not far from here,” he said. Bandile Maduna (34) said crime was out of control. “Unfortunately, the media is missing all of this. It’s worse than in other areas,” he said. Nozibele Mancoko (34) said she was sleeping when she heard screams. She said they didn’t even bother to call the police. “The police are afraid of this area, and we don’t blame them because criminals burst their tyres,” she said. Nozibele said cops come in large numbers in the day but are scared at night. “We don’t blame them. By coming here they risk their lives,” she said. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said they were investigating a triple murder case after two women and a man between the ages of 23 and 30 were found with gunshot wounds to their heads. “Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation, with no arrests so far,” Rwexana said. “Detectives are following up on possible leads.”
