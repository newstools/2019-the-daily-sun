A family of 19 has been sharing drinking water with cows on a farm for almost 40 years. Mgcineni Xundulu (40) told Daily Sun his family arrived at Geelhoutboom Farm in Alexandria in the Eastern Cape in 1980. “Dozens of dairy cows would poo and urinate in the dam and still drink the water with us. “Our parents never complained as they were scared of losing their jobs and being kicked off the farm.” Mgcineni said he thought things would change with the new government after 1994. “Our situation remained the same. My grandfather and father died. We also worked on the farm and nobody wanted to speak out. “But in 2007 the farmer put a plastic dam in one of the cows’ grazing fields. We ended up drinking water from that plastic dam with his cows,” said Mgcineni. Gogo Nowanele Lalase said: “We only drink fresh water on rainy days as we harvest water with our drums.” She said the dam water caused their stomachs to run. Ward councillor Thembekile Mbunge said: “I have been battling to get a water tank for this family. But before the end of this week, they’ll have a water tank.”
