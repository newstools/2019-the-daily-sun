DJ and producer Heavy K allegedly had a run-in with Botswana cops on Sunday night. The DJ, who was deejaying at Bahama Lounge in Gaborone was booked to perform at Morobosi Festival in Botswana in 2017, but failed to pitch, a source said. Promoter Morobosi Entertainment opened a case against him. A court order stated the DJ should be kept safe should he be found in the country until he appears at Lobatse High Court on 15 August. The court said he owes Morobosi Entertainment R87 000. The source said while Heavy K was deejaying at the club, cops waited for him to finish his set. “They went outside and spoke in the car before they left him to go back into the club,” the source said. Deputy public relations officer of Botswana Police Service Near Bagali confirmed cops spoke to Heavy K. “Cops were on the scene... but Heavy K was not held. The matter was found to be a civil case.” After a fan asked if he was bust in Botswana, The Inde hitmaker tweeted: “Bro I’m safe! I’ll deal with this legally and the same people will go back to social media to apologise.” Heavy K did not answer Daily Sun’s calls.
