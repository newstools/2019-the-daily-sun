SHE thought they were a match made in heaven and a sangoma confirmed it. It all started after Mabizwa Ndlovu (54) from Soweto joined a dating site. She had been single since her husband died in 2009. “I found a man who matched all my requirements. He was 50, single and wanted true love.” She said they exchanged contacts and after chatting for a long time, they planned to meet. But the man told Mabizwa he wanted them to visit his sister, a gobela, in Protea Glen in Soweto. The sister confirmed they were a perfect match. Mabizwa was taken to a dark room where she claims a woman’s voice spoke to her. “The voice said it was my gogo who died many years ago. I believed it was her by the way she described herself.” She said the gogo told her she wanted to give her R10 million. “At first I was told to get R100 000 but I couldn’t at once. I was told bad luck needed to be removed so the money’s not blocked. I started bringing money every time I went there.” She was told to bring R50 000 last week but was robbed at gunpoint by two men allegedly working with the sister. The three were bust for theft under false pretences and armed robbery. Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said the suspects appeared in court last week and were denied bail.
