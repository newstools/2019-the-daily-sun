COPS at Bloemspruit Police Station have been surrounded by kak for more than a year. The situation was so bad that residents of the suburb of Bloemfontein didn’t want to go to the station to open cases. Cops told Daily Sun a blocked pipe was spewing sewage into the yard and they had to hold their noses whenever they were at work. “The leakage was reported to the municipality last year but nothing has been done. The sewage runs in from the gate and surrounds the cop shop. We constantly have headaches because of the smell,” said one cop. He said the sewage was a health hazard. Resident Maria Moloane (54) said the situation became even worse when it rained. “The municipality should attend to the matter before the cop shop closes. No one deserves to work surrounded by kak,” she said. Mangaung spokesman Qondile Khedama said a team was sent to fix the problem. “A police station cannot be in such a state,” he said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “The matter was reported to the public works department. It was discovered that water was oozing from the ground from an unknown source and filled up the septic tanks. An application has been made to the municipality to join the sewerage system in Bloemspruit to the main one.” she said.
