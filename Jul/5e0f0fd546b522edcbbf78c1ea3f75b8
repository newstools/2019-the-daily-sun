FORMER Kazier Chiefs Defender Teenage Hadebe has been unveiled by his new team, Yeni Malatyaspor, in Turkey after passing his medical. The Zimbabwean international joined the Turkish outfit on a two-year-deal.  “The new transfer of our new Malatyaspor, Teenage Lingani Hadebe, passed a health check at Acibadem Altunizade Hospital,” read a statement on the club’s website. “Detailed blood tests were performed; orthopedics, internal medicine, eye, otolaryngology, general surgery and cardiology departments. Health checks were completed with lung, cardiac tests and radiological controls.” Although he will be a loss for the Glamour Boys, Hadebe’s departure has left a spot open for one more foreign player. Chiefs, who have already secured the services of Zambian striker Lazalous Kambole, Ghanaian midfielder James Kotei as well as Serbian goal ace Samir Nurkovic, will have room to accommodate their foreign imports.
