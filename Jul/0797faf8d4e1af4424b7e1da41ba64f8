BAFANA Bafana have scraped into the knockout phase of the 2019 African Cup of Nations as a number of group results went their way on Thursday. South Africa were on the brink of a Group stage exit after their last-minute defeat to Morocco on Monday evening. However, Stuart Baxter's men needed Angola, Mauritania, Kenya, Guinea-Bissau and Benin to miss out on three points and the unthinkable has occurred. They made it into the Round of 16 as one of the lucky third placed teams after Ghana defeated Guinea-Bissau 2-0 and Benin and Cameroon drew 0-0 in Group F, while Mali made Mzansi a favour by grinding out a 1-0 win in their Group E encounter against Angola. Now South Africa will face hosts Egypt on Saturday night (9pm), at Cairo International Stadium.
