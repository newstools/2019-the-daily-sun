Cyril Nzama had a funny and unique way of celebrating his goals. He would wave his hands around as if he was a Ninja jiving to a Kwaito song – hence the nickname “Skhokho”. Even though he always flashed a broad smile, the Soweto-born Nzama was a solid defender who took no prisoners when it came to 50/50 situations. He also loved surging forward and launching attacks, and for that he was easily mistaken for a midfielder. In his prime, Nzama played more than 40 games for Bafana Bafana and featured in all SA matches at the 2002 Fifa World Cup at Korea/Japan. The squad was coached by legendary Jomo Sono. Before Amakhosi, he turned out for local amateur clubs in Soweto. He then found his way into the professional ranks with Bush Bucks, where he established himself as a player to be reckoned with. He started attracting attention from the big boys and Amakhosi swooped on the player – he was later to spend 8 fruitful years at Naturena where he endeared himself to the Chiefs die-hard supporters. With age no longer in his side, he joined Bay United after leaving Amakhosi. How best do you remember u Skhokho?
