THE only positive thing coming out of Bafana Bafana's 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) campaign, obviously despite South Africa's 1-0 win over host nation Egypt, is their leap in Fifa rankings, up two place. It is a big step from 72 to 70th, which can be attributed to the win against the Pharaoh. And clearly head coach Stuart Baxter must be watching in his device and telling himself: "And I have improved their rankings, what more do they want?" The actual gripe with Baxter, who is in his second stint with Bafana, his tactics have not been convincing, which irked the supporters, more especially that he failed to qualify for the Fifa World Cup last year. Another uproar that divided South Africans is whether Safa should keep Baxter in his job, especially after making life difficult for himself by attacking the 56 million population through his comments in Egyp, as well as hanging the country's dirty linen in public with international newspapers in England. But fact remains that Bafana are rated higher than before. The biggest winners in the rankings are African champions Algeria who have moved to 40th in the world, going up a massive 28 places having scored 117 points in the July edition. But their fellow finalists Senegal remains top of Africa and 20th having gone up 2 places, which is not a huge leap by their standards, but reached their best-ever world ranking position. In other rankings, semi-finalists Nigeria are at number 33, up 12 places. It goes without saying that surprise quarter-finalists Madagascar had to move up considerably following their amazing display at the tournament, and are now at 96 in the world, having found themselves going up 12 places. Benin are 82nd, up 6 moves.Belgium, Brazil, France, England and Uruguay are placed at number one to five, respectively. The next world rankings will be published on 19 September.
