NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality has built a children’s dam in Elundini kasi. The natural pool is meant for local kids to swim in. It will be available to kids from nearby New Brighton and KwaZakhele so they too can learn how to swim. Project manager Bulelani Mara said: “The pool will be officially opened in September. It’s finished but it’s still too cold to use. “We’re happy to have finished this project so kasi children can learn how to swim. “The dam is very shallow, at 1,8m deep, and it cost the Metro R2,8 million.” Mara says they got the idea from the swimming pool at King’s Beach in Port Elizabeth. “We’ll build more dams like this one in townships and employ professionals to watch the children,” he said. Gerhard Scholtz of Alpha and Omega Construction said they worked with kasi subcontractors to build the dam. “We also employed people from this ward,” said Scholtz. “The project took us about 12 months. “I was robbed once, but the residents stood by us and protected us. “I’m happy we finished the work on time.”
