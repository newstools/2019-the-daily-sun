How many times have we heard false promises from police ministers about Senzo Meyiwa’s death? The soccer player was killed in a room full of witnesses and still the cops claim they have not made any progress in catching his killers. Now the one man who spent the last part of his life agonising over his murder is gone – and with him, no doubt, any urgency to solve this crime. It echoes the suffering of many South Africans who have lost loved ones, only to spend desperate nights and days wondering if they will ever have closure or justice for the crimes committed against those they cherish. Unfortunately, these days SunLand knows that talking tough and acting tougher is just that – talking and acting. What we want to see are results, not visiting families after the fact for a photo opportunity and another hollow promise.
