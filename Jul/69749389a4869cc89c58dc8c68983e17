MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has explained Tokelo Rantie’s presence in his camp. He said the Bafana Bafana striker asked to train with the Brazilians at the Ingwenyana Sports Resort in Mpumalanga during pre-season in Mpumalanga, in order to keep fit. Explains Mosimane: “We have given him a chance to redeem himself. He told me that he wanted to get his condition back. He added that he will be happy if I would give him contract. “The guy has played in the English Premier League and he has played in Turkey, at a big club. So you always have to give the second chance, I always believe that you should give others a chance. “In life everyone deserves a second chance. Normally when you do that then the person gets better and offers more.” Before Sundowns came to his rescue, Rantie was back in the football wilderness after he left Cape Town City in December last year due to personal reasons. He also left his former club Genclerbirligi in Turkey in October 2017 under a cloud. The 28-year-old, who scored when Bafana beat Nigeria in June 2017 in the African Cup of Nations qualifier in the first game for Stuart Baxter, has got his work cut out to prove his fitness. Added Mosimane: “He’s not old. Of course he has had other issues off the field and that is why I’m saying he can redeem himself, he has a chance. “Maybe he’s still an option for Bafana in the future, you will never know. “But first he must prove himself on the pitch. So we have set no time frame for him to be signed. “We greed for him to train first, and if I’m impressed then I’ll sign him.”
