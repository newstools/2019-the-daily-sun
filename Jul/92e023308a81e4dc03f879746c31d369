TWENTY families were evicted in Alexandra yesterday. Standing next to their belongings thrown into the middle of Selborne Street and 11th Avenue, the gatvol residents clashed with cops. According to the fuming families who claimed to have lived on the stand for as long as they could remember, a woman wanted to steal their land. On Monday, they received eviction orders from the woman claiming to be the owner of the property. She wanted them to vacate the land within 24 hours. Maggie Ramokgosi (38) said: “The person who claims the land belongs to her doesn’t even have a title deed and submitted a permit. The housing department told us the land belongs to the city.” “When we brought proof that the land belongs to us, cops didn’t want to listen. They started shooting at us. “All we are asking for is the city and human settlements to sort the mess out. We just need proof this place is hers.” Another resident Lindiwe Mbhele (58) said: “If this place belongs to her, she must produce papers proving it. She claims the place was given to her by her grandfather. “We built all these houses you see here from scratch.” Councillor Ambe Maseko was allegedly shot at when cops started targeting the evicted families. She said the people who live in the yard showed her the eviction orders. “I told them no one has the power to evict residents in Alex because the stands belong to the municipality,” she said. “I was shot at. Cops told me no one should intervene when they work.” Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun the cops were called to restore calm. “The sheriff was in the area to evict families following a court order. During the evictions, a local councillor and residents held a meeting, which ended up in a clash. “Cops were called to the scene to restore order. The area is now calm and no one was arrested,” he said.
