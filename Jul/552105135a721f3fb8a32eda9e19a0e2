FORMER South African lightweight champion Thompson “Silent Destroyer” Mokwana has moved up a division to campaign as a junior welterweight, and is expecting to be crowned champion again. Mokwana surrendered his lightweight crown to a much younger Ayanda “Greyhound” Nkosi at the KwaThema Community Centre over the weekend. This was his second defence of the title he won two years ago against Mzonke Fana. Now the veteran fighter believes this is the best time for him to move up a division after struggling with weight problems for two years. “For me to move up to a heavier division was long overdue,” said Mokwana. “I have been struggling to make the lightweight division for the past two years. “At times I would go to the scale drained in order to make the weight limit. It was even worse this time because I used a sauna to get rid of the kilogram. I was overweight. “After the fight, I had a chat with my trainer Manny Fernandez about my weight problem. We agreed that I should move up. I believe in my abilities and boxing skills that I can still be crowned champion in the new division. “It is a matter of time before I win another title.” The 34-year-old fighter has taken the defeat (to Nkosi) on the chin, and he wished his conquer all the best in the future. “He took his advantage well. His uppercut and straight right were lethal. This boy will achieve more on the international stage if he continues to be focused. I wish him the best of luck in the future,” concluded Mokwana. This was a third straight knockout loss for the seasoned campaigner. Last year he fell short in his quest to annex the vacant WBO Africa lightweight crown at the hands of Simphiwe Vetyeka. In March, he suffered another stoppage against Michael Mokoena.
