 THE
fire season is nearing closer and closer in the areas of Southern Africa,
including the Mopani District Municipal area. Due
to the prevailing drought conditions, vegetation becomes extremely dry and the
risk of veldfire occurrence is high. Mopani
District Municipality spokesperson Witness Tiva said Landowners are thus
advised to be vigilant and ensure that they comply in terms of the National
Veld and Forest Fire Act. The
Mopani Fire and Rescue Services advised landowners of their legal obligation
under the Veld and Forest Fire Act (101 of 1998) to prepare and maintain
firebreaks on their property. Tiva
said such firebreaks must be prepared as anticipated in the Veld and Forest
Fire Act, with due regard for weather, climate, terrain and vegetation of the
area. Firebreaks
must also be wide and long enough that there is a reasonable chance of
preventing the spread of a fire to or from neighbouring land. The
onus of veldfire prevention thus rests with the landowner, who must also ensure
a state of fire-fighting readiness should a fire occur, or threaten to occur,
on their property. "This
fire-fighting readiness includes the landowner making provision for appropriate
fire-fighting equipment, protective clothing and trained personnel for their
property," Tiva said. The
removal of these plants is thus imperative in proper fire management. Tiva
urged landowners to report emergencies to the Mopani Centralised Communication
Centre on (015) 307-5555 or (015) 306-7000.
