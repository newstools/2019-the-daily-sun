LIMBIKANI Mzava has completed a move to Highland Park. The Malawian defender was released by Golden Arrows at the end of last season after spending three years with the Durban based club where he made 82 appearances while scoring four Premiership goals. However, it hasn't taken long for the Blantyre-born to find the new home as Lions of North have quickly acted by capturing himas they continuing with their shopping spree bolstering their squad ahead of the 2019-20 season. A reliable informant told SunSport that Mzava has joined his former teammate Wayde Jooste who has also joined the Lion of The North. Stated the informant: "It's a done deal. Mzava has signed for Highlands Park. He is currently with the team in their pre-season. They will be leaving for Cape Town on Sunday where they will held their pre season camp." Mzava re-unites with coach Owen da Gama whom he worked with at Bloemfontein Celtic couple of seasons ago. Other players signed by Tembisa-based club ahead of the new season are Makhehleni Makhaula, Marks Munyai and Rodney Ramagalela.
