COUPLES expecting babies are already getting very little sleep. This is because thugs are targeting pregnant women in Alexandra, Joburg. The thugs gain entry when the couple is asleep. They allegedly tie the man up and rape the woman. At least two incidents of a similar nature have been reported to Alexandra cops. Alexandra police spokesman Captain Stephen Malatjie confirmed the incidents to Daily Sun. He appealed to community members to stay alert after a series of rape and robbery cases were reported. “We warn community members in and around Alexandra to remain vigilant,” he said. He said a couple was robbed of their valuables, while the six month pregnant girlfriend was raped by two suspects wearing balaclavas. “The two men allegedly mysteriously gained access to the couple’s house on 26 June at about 2.30am. “They pointed a firearm at the couple, demanding cash and cellphones. They tied the boyfriend to a small table and took the girlfriend outside,” said Malatjie. He said when the girlfriend returned, she told the boyfriend she was raped by the suspects. Malatjie said a similar incident happened in the area a few weeks ago and police were still investigating. Pregnant Sindi Nkabinde (29) told the People’s Paper she heard about the two cases. “I am five months pregnant and I’m so scared. I can’t sleep at night thinking about whether they will come,” she said. She said she hoped the police find the suspects quickly. “Otherwise, one will have to leave this area and only come back after giving birth,” she said. Ntobeko Mbatha (32) said: “I asked my fiance to ask his brothers to stay with us. At least the thugs will fear attacking us when there are many men in the house.”
