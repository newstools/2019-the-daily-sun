TOP Belgian side Clube Brugge are in the hunt to borrow forward Percy Tau. But the club face a strong competition across Europe to sign Brighton & Hove Albion's sought-after South African star. Several clubs from different parts of Europe have expressed an interest in Tau, according Argus reports in the United Kingdom. Brugge are the side that finished second in Belgium's top flight, the Jupiler Pro League, to Genk last season. Tau's move will not be permanent one but it is a loan deal.Â But there is no suggestion that Albion are giving up on the work permit challenges currently preventing him from coming to England. Tau has already proven himself in Belgium. He scored 13 goals and provided 13 assists in the country's second tier last season for Union Saint-Gilloise, who are owned by Albion chairman Tony Bloom. The former Mamelodi Sundowns forward recently helped South Africa reach the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. His country's low FIFA ranking is one of the obstacles in the complicated process of securing a work permit for the 25-year-old. Tau has scored nine goals in 24 Bafana appearances. He has previously been linked to a loan move to Amiens SC in France's top flight, the club that his former club's teammate Bongani Zungu plays for. Their new manager, Luka Elsner, was Tau's boss at USG last season.
