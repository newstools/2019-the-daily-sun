RETIRED footballer Teko Modise seems to have made peace with his estranged father. Teko took to his Instagram page to post a photo of him sitting with his father Steven Sekgaila. He wrote: “Never Thought I Would Actually Say This, Never Mind Posting the Only Pic I Have of Us, Forgiveness Is Important for Peace, Sanity & Growth...MY DAD ??” In his 2017 memoir titled The Curse of Teko Modise, the former PSL and Bafana Bafana star revealed his broken relationship with his father. His father apparently kicked him out when he was eight years-old. In the book Teko further revealed that when he became a big time soccer star, he got a call from SABC 1 show Khumbulekhaya. The long running TV show reunites people with their long lost relatives. He was quoted by TimesLive as saying, “"My dad knows where my family stays. If he wants to see me he must organise a meeting with the family. He can't just get hold of me on television now that I am Teko Modise. These were issues that we could have solved privately." Teko said while his father's intentions may have been good, he didn't appreciate his "dodgy" approach. "This is the guy who threw me out on the streets like I was nothing and never looked back. Now that I am famous he wants to be with me. If he did things properly and requested a meeting with me by going through the family then I would probably be friends with him to this day. It would have been nice to have a relationship with my father. But it seems the 36 year-old recently retired midfielder has made peace and forgiven his old man.
