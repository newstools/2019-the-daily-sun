SELLO “Chicco” Twala said he wished to attend Sam Meyiwa’s funeral but was worried how social media users would react. The music producer, singer and businessman said yesterday it was his wish to grieve with the Meyiwas. “I’m not going to be at the funeral because I’m afraid people will use social media to associate my attendance with my son’s presence during Senzo’s murder,” said Chicco. “They might create fake stories, especially while this murder case has not yet been solved.” Chicco’s son Longwe and others were at the house of Kelly Khumalo’s mum in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, where Senzo was gunned down in October 2014. Chicco defended his son after soccer fans called for him and those who were at the house to say who had killed Senzo. Chicco said Sam died before justice had been served. “Sam was stressed. I believe the stress contributed to his death,” said Chicco. “It’s sad that he died while no one had yet been arrested for killing his son. It’s painful and I’d like to send my condolences to his family.” He said Longwe wanted the case to be solved and to clear his name. “My son is very unhappy,” said Chicco. “We both hope that cops do their job and arrest the culprit because we’re still seen as bad people.” Sam had a stroke last year, affecting his speech and keeping him wheelchair-bound. He suffered another one recently.
