GOGO Lanai Nkuna is a worried woman and all she wants is to see her long-lost son who disappeared three decades ago. The 79-year-old from Xanthia Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga said it’s a struggle for her to sleep every night because she has no idea whether her son is still alive or not. She said her son, Erick Ndlovu, went missing 34 years ago after going to Barberton, in Mpumalanga to look for work on a farm. “Since he disappeared, I have not slept well and I have stress which has affected my health. My wish is to see him again. His father died while looking for him. “When he left, he was with his friend who told us that while they were in Barberton, apartheid police chased them and arrested Erick,” she said. Collen Masinga (30) said they believe their uncle might still be alive as they haven’t dreamt of him being dead. “As a family, we really long to see him, especially now that gogo is not well. She keeps calling his name. “If she dies now, her soul will not rest in peace. We plead with people out there to assist us with information so that this matter can be put to rest,” said Collen.
