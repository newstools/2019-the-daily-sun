THE intense rivalry between Nkunzi and Khathaza is clearly a
hit for Mzansi’s number one telenovela Uzalo.  On its Instagram page, Uzalo announced that their viewership
had again toppled the 10 million mark. Last year, the KZN based SABC 1 production made Mzansi TV history
when it became the first TV programme from Mzansi to hit the 10 million mark. This will be something to smile about not just for the cast
and crew but also for the troubled SABC whose money problems have threatened
the production of Uzalo in the past. The show posted a video featuring its lead actors on
on-screen enemies Nkunzi (Masoja Msiza)
and Khathaza (Sibonile Ngubane) singing
and dancing to the show’s theme song. The two stars thank their viewers for their loyalty. In its four years on air,Uzalo has evolved from its original
storyline involving  two families from
KwaMashu who find out that their sons were switched at birth.  #Uzalo Reigns Supreme. ?? THANK YOU to our AH-MAZING viewers! ????
