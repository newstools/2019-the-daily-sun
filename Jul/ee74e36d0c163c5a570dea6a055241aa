POLICE Minister Bheki Cele yesterday said he was tired of burying cops and declared war on cop killers. He was speaking at the memorial service for murdered Constable Songezo Khetiwe at St Matthews Anglican Church in Delft, Cape Town yesterday. Khetiwe, who worked at the Delft Police Station was murdered while on duty last week. Cele said: “Somebody somewhere has declared war on the police and the state. It is a treason you have committed.” An angry Cele said cops should fight fire with fire because criminals were clearly willing to kill. “Criminals plan to eliminate anybody in their way. “These criminals are not carrying broomsticks, they are not carrying mushrooms, they are carrying hard stuff,” he said. “Hard stuff is responded to by hard stuff. “I’m not a warlord but I’m not an undertaker either to be burying cops every weekend.” Cele said he was ready to protect cops at all cost but he warned cops he would not do so if they were caught on the wrong side of the law. “If you go to a search operation and steal R15 000, we will not protect you but will rather deal with you. “We are ready to protect those who are protecting citizens and themselves against dangerous criminals,” he said. The constable’s brother Mzuvumile described him as the sweetest person he knew. “We have lost a brother, a father and a close friend. He was one of the good people I knew in my life,” he said.
