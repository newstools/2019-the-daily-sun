THE landing of the Guptas at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in Tshwane hurt the image of South Africa and the Air Force. This was what Air Force chief Lieutenant-General Zimpande Msimang told the Zondo Commission yesterday. “This hurt me personally. This is totally unacceptable,” he said. Msimang said he was shocked when he learned the Guptas had landed at Waterkloof as he had earlier refused their request. Major William Matsila told the commission the instruction to allow the plane to land allegedly came from chief of state protocol Bruce Koloane. He said he received a call from Koloane asking him to assist the Indian government with clearance. He said it had never happened before that a clearance was issued without a Note Verbal, correspondence between two states. A Note Verbal states the name of the person visiting and nature of the visit. He said a clearance number issued was done without international relations department authorisation. Lieutenant-General Mbuyiselo Mgwebi, acting director-general of the military veterans department, said procedures were ignored and it seemed Koloane pulled strings.
