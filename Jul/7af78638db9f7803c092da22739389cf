HIP hop and club DJ C-Live lost his son Nadiff Kgoleng in a horror blaze four years ago. Since then he’s never spoken about the tragedy, but he will release a song this weekend. Coco Dreams tells the story of healing from grief. He told Daily Sun: “This project is very personal. It’s about trauma, loss, grief, anxiety and depression.” The DJ, whose real name is Clive Shabalala, said the last words Nadiff said to him before dying at the age of 11 were “good night” and “Coco dreams”. The song features rappers PDot O and T-Phoenix and was produced by SilasBeats. “It will be released tomorrow and the video will be launched next Saturday. “I have not said anything since I lost my son in 2015 because I was healing. I was rediscovering myself,” he said. The DJ said speaking about it was like opening an old wound. “It’s hard but until you have been through it, you will never know what you’re capable of.” He said he partnered with the SA Depression and Anxiety Group to get the word out about the song. “We have bigger plans. I’ll reveal them soon but the aim is to get a conversation started, especially with men. We don’t talk about our emotional well-being,” he said.
