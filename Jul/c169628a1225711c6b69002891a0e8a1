NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality yesterday increased the fares for its Libhongolethu bus service. Fares for the service, which operates between the CBD and a number of kasis, were increased from R5 to R8. The municipality said they were forced to increase fares because fuel prices had gone up. “The recent fuel price hikes have resulted in increased operating costs for the bus service. “The fare increase will ensure that the bus service remains financially stable,” said the municipality. Arcadia resident Joan Blom (34) said she would have to travel less. “The bus service was cheap and very safe. I’m unemployed so I will only travel for important reasons now,” she said. Shaun Plaatjies (28) of Booysens Park said the bus fare was still cheaper than taxis, which cost R15. “When the bus was introduced, they said it would be very cheap but now they have increased the fare by R3. “Let’s hope they won’t keep increasing fares. I will continue using the bus because it’s the cheapest form of transport we have.”
