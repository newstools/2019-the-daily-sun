KING Goodwill Zwelithini has once again called on Zulus to be prepared to fight if the government decides to expropriate land belonging to the Ingonyama Trust. He was speaking in Ulundi, northern KZN, yesterday to mark the 140th anniversary of the burning of King Cetshwayo’s palace. This was after the British army defeated Zulu warriors in the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. Zwelithini told a crowd of more than 1 000 that his position on defending the land had not changed. He said the government had not done anything solid to assure him the land in the trust would not be affected by land expropriation without compensation. “Zulus, you must be ready to defend your land and your culture from any man or woman who wants to take it away from you. “Otherwise, you will be nothing in your own land,” he said. The king also called on locals not to burn trucks on the N3 freeway between Joburg and Durban as this was not only criminal but was also a direct hit on the KwaZulu-Natal economy and that of the country. IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi warned Zulus to resist the destruction of the Ingonyama Trust.
