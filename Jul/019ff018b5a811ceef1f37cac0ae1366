Hey MizzB I AM a 25-year-old theology student and youth pastor at my church. I’m in a relationship with a 22-year-old woman that I really love. But I have a problem. When I’m alone I watch a lot of porn. This has been going on since I was in school. It has consumed my personal life and leaves me feeling embarrassed and guilty. Please save me from this demon. Hey Guy The more you watch porn the greater your desire for it will be. To end it you must be willing to learn new behaviours. Share your feelings with someone you trust or a professional. I must commend you. It takes courage to be open about this. Share more on this by sending a Please Call Me to 083 346 1023, or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za
