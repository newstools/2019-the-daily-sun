UNEMPLOYED agriculture graduates will be given unused land to pursue farming. That was according to Mpumalanga Agriculture MEC Vusi Shongwe, speaking during his policy and budget speech on Friday. Shongwe said the database of state-leased land has been developed already and the department targeted to create 35 new farms. “A decision has been taken to compile a register of all leased farms with the department of rural development and reform, showing the number of operational and non-operational farms in the province. “This will help the distribution of non-operational farms for women and youth to address the challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality.” He said the department will place youth from the Mpumalanga young farmer incubation programme on identified land from sources like unused and underutilised state and private land. Shongwe also said the department would renovate former Elijah Mango Training College as a farmer training centre, along with the revamped Marapyane Farmer Training Centre. “These two centres will contribute to the agricultural sector by providing training of farmers in key agricultural products.” The department plans to train 6 800 farmers in various agricultural skills and another 1 110 young farmers through the national skills fund.
