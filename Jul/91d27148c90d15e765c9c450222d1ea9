THE mum of a mentally ill girl found tied to a chair by neighbours broke her silence yesterday. SEE: MUM BUST FOR CHAINING CHILD TO CHAIR! After spending two days in jail, the 30-year-old woman from Bela Bela, Limpopo, said she tied the 12-year-old up to prevent her from injuring herself. The mum of three was arrested on Tuesday after neighbours called the cops. She said she tied the girl up with a doek and locked the house so she could go to the nearby shop. “I live with my children and my boyfriend, the stepfather of my other two kids. I don’t have extended family to help me with her. “I’m not defending what I did but my neighbours could have made me aware they were calling the police to arrest me.” She begged for forgiveness for her actions. She was charged with child abuse, neglect and abandonment. She was granted R500 bail in the Bela Bela Magistrates Court. The case was postponed to next month for further police investigations and for her to consult Legal Aid lawyers. The court recommended she be psychologically assessed. Social development department spokesman Kanakana Mantshimuli said: “We condemn child abuse and neglect. We have social workers trained to assist people with these issues.” Resident Nhlamariso Manganyi (30) praised neighbours and cops for their swift action. “What this mum did was very bad and needed police intervention,” Nhlamariso said.
