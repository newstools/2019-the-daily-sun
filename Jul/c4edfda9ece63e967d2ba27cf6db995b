Former
police crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli and his co-accused Mthembeni
Mthunzi have been found guilty on charges relating to the 1999 kidnapping and
assault of Oupa Ramogibe. Raogibe was
married to Mdluli’s former lover Tshidi Buthelezi. Judge Ratha
Mokgoatlheng delivered the judgment in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg
on Tuesday. Based on
the evidence, that Mokgoatlheng listened to for over four years, he found
Mdluli guilty on four counts of intimidation, two counts of kidnapping, two
counts of common assault and two counts of assault with intent to do grievous
bodily harm. Mthunzi was
found guilty on two counts of kidnapping, two counts of common assault and two
counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. They were
both acquitted on intimidation of Buthelezi's friend Alice Manana, and
defeating the ends of justice. The matter
was postponed to Wednesday to deal with sentencing. Mdluli had
a long-term relationship with Buthelezi dating back to his school days. During
her relationship with him, she met Ramogibe and they began a relationship. They
eventually got married on July 22, 1998. Between
1997 and 1999, Mdluli allegedly went to extreme lengths to track down Buthelezi
and Ramogibe. Mdluli and Mthunzi allegedly intimidated, kidnapped and assaulted
Ramogibe. He was shot dead in 1999. No one was
ever convicted of Ramogibe’s murder. Mdluli was accused of sabotaging the
investigation. NPA
regional spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane welcomed the verdict. "It
has been a long journey for both the justice criminal system and the victims
that were involved in the crimes perpetrated by both the convicted persons. "We
welcome the fact that the court has dismissed both their defence that the whole
thing was a conspiracy against them," she said. SOURCE:
