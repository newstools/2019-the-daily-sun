TEACHING and learning continued normally at Vukuzakhe High School yesterday. Scores of pupils and teachers from the school in K section of Umlazi, south of Durban, had to be rushed to hospital after getting itchy throats and coughing. Some even had seizures and collapsed. It was believed the incident was caused by a burst ball a group of boys were playing with during break. The ball allegedly had some kind of toxic chemical inside which affected everyone around it. It was apparently brought into the school by a boy who picked it up on the road. On Monday, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said 50 to 60 patients were treated at the scene and rushed to hospital. He said among them was a teacher who suffered from asthma and had to be airlifted to hospital in a critical condition. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi confirmed that classes went back to normal. “About 50 pupils complained about pounding headaches and the school referred those cases to health practitioners. The situation was monitored,” he said.
