GOGO can now take a shower in her newly refurbished house thanks to the Red Berets. The new-look house was handed over to Nomziwakhe Hlobo (74) of unit P, near Mdantsane, Eastern Cape, on Tuesday. The move came after EFF leader Julius Malema visited the area during the party’s fifth anniversary celebrations last year. He found the house in a terrible state because of poor plumbing and promised to attend to it. Eastern Cape EFF chairman Yazini Thetyana said the party spent more than R200 000 to renovate the house. “We made it suitable for gogo because she’s wheelchair-bound. We furnished it and installed a geyser. She also has a shower and there’s also a toilet inside. “When we take over government, these are the houses we’ll build for our people. We thank our leader, Julius Malema, for helping this gogo so that she can live better,” he said. Gogo Nomziwakhe said she was very happy with what Malema did for her. “I’ll never forget him. I worked for the ANC for years, but they did nothing for me. I’m one of the people who cooked for comrades during apartheid. “I believe in prayer and I prayed about my situation. Then I saw people wearing red T-shirts come to my house. Julius Malema must know I will vote for the EFF until I die,” she said.
