PRELIMINARY reports have revealed that five of the nine interns who died in a horrific accident on Friday were from Badplaas, Carolina and Hendrina in Mpumalanga. Four of them were from Limpopo, North West and KZN. This was revealed by the Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety yesterday. The nine interns died during a head-on collision between their minibus taxi and a truck on the N11 between Middelburg and Hendrina on Friday. Eight of them were burnt beyond recognition. The youths were coming from an induction when the accident happened. Community Safety spokesman Moeti Mmusi said the process of taking DNA samples from family members would be conducted by the police victim identification centre. The process would be done at a government mortuary in Middleburg today. Erno Janse van Rensburg of ALS Plant Hire said it was difficult for the mine to say anything at this time as they were still busy identifying people. “We are trying our utmost to help the families. We have sent out vehicles to transport the families to the province as some of them are not from around here. What happened is very tragic,” he said.
