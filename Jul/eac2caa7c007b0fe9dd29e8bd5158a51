SHE is known for having financial headaches in the eTV soapie Scandal! But now the problems faced by her character Gloria have become a reality in Marjorie Langa’s real life. Abby Sibbs, owner of a company called Uber Transport Services, said Marjorie borrowed R30 000 to invest in a tender but never paid her back. She said she first made excuses and started avoiding calls, WhatsApp messages and SMSes. “On 3 April, Marjorie called my husband asking for money and said she’d pay him back in days,” she said. However, when she was supposed to pay the money back two days later, she allegedly ducked and dived. Abby showed the SunTeam screenshots and voice notes proving Marjorie owed them money. When contacted, Marjorie told Daily Sun: “I had serious family issues. I just lost my father, who I’m still grieving for. But I’ll settle this.”
