FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs striker, Katlego “Killer” Mphela, wants to see more killer instinct in front of goals from South Africans forwards. Speaking at the Sports Plus Academy in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, where he spends most of his time grooming young strikers, Mphela said more work needs to be done to guide strikers at a higher level. Mphela, who doesn’t see himself playing professionally again, now focuses on becoming a strikers’ coach. “I don’t see myself coaching the whole team because I don’t think I’d be able to handle all the different personalities and egos. “That’s a difficult thing to do. But if I can help with something, then I will. Maybe as a striker coach because I have the experience. “I’ve missed chances in big games, so I already know what you have to do to score goals,” he said. Mphela, who struggled with injuries in the later stages of his career, has no ambition to be a head coach, but as a former lethal striker himself, Mphela wants to help curb the finishing disease that has plagued South African football for a long time. The 34-year-old from Britz, in North West, has been less than impressed by what he has seen from local strikers in front of goal in the past few seasons. He believes there’s plenty of room for improvement. Dubbed “Killer” because of his natural instinct and eye for goals during his heydays, Mphela is widely considered one of the best strikers Mzansi has ever produced. Mphela’s best season domestically came in the 2009/10 season in the colours of Sundowns where he banged in 17 goals to clinch the golden boot. “Our strikers need guidance, coaches need to work with these guys more,” said Mphela. “If they have to work twice a day, so be it. It’s their job, they get paid for it. Our last top-scorer was from Zambia. Clearly, local guys need to push themselves harder.”
