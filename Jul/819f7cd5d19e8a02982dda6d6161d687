The National Commissioner and SAPS Management have learned with shock of yet another killing of a SAPS member on Wednesday 3 July 2019. Constable Ntobeko Nhlanhla Langa was being followed by a white sedan with three male occupants in the said vehicle. When the member stopped his vehicle, one suspect alighted from the sedan and fired multiple shots at him, killing him instantly. Nothing, including the member’s service pistol, was taken from the member. The member was attached to the Crime Intelligence Unit in Soweto East since 2011 and he was due to testify in the Randfontein Magistrate’s Court this Morning, Thursday 4 July 2019. The National Commissioner of police, General Khehla John Sitole has condemned the killing of Constable Langa. "My sincere condolences to the family and colleagues of the deceased member. I have directed that the province mobilise all resources to ensure that they track down these callous criminals and bring them to book", said General Sitole. In a separate incident, also yesterday, another member of the SAPS was shot and wounded while conducting crime prevention duties in Atteridgeville, west of Pretoria. The member was part of a team that was searching for suspects that had allegedly been committing robberies in the area. In a routine stop-and-search, the team pulled off a vehicle but as they ordered the suspect to alight from the vehicle, he began shooting towards the members, wounding Constable Tumelo Raphael Mohlala. The members returned fire at the suspect. He was later certified dead. The National Commissioner has wished the member a speedy recovery. "I applaud the members of the team for their bravery and for not backing down", said General Sitole.
