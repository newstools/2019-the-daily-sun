Mzansi woke up to a racy nude pic from TV personality Minnie Dlamini. The star is definitely bringing the heat this winter. Mrs Jones recently launched her skin care line MD by Minnie Dlamini and she has been sharing a series of pictures celebrating her skin, in line with the motto for her range of skincare products. The picture captioned “MD, Celebrate your skin  #MDSkincare” received almost 100K likes and the day hasn’t even ended yet!. Over the weekend, the star hosted her closest friend to an exclusive launch for her skin care range, with a pamper party theme. The launch was attended by her close friends and industry peers including Unathi, Gert Johan-Coetzee and Nomuzi.
