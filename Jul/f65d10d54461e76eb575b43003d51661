Tickets for the Carling Black Label Cup encounter between Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Piarates have been sold out, two weeks before the match. The encounter is set to take place at the FNB Stadium on 27 July. Chiefs have confirmed that fans who could not grab their tickets early enough, will have to watch the much anticipated match on TV.  Amakhosi will be hoping to defend their title when the off-season tournament returns after a year’s absence. This year fans have been given more control through the new “change the game” element that allows them to vote for newly proposed seven rules, as part of the action on match day. This will allow fans to select the captain on the day, the man of the match and to make a substitution through Twitter. As far as the votes are concerned, Chiefs are leading with 480 031 votes already cast by their supporters. Striker Bernard Parker and goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune are the most popular players with 83 341 and 75 427 votes respectively. For Pirates, Justin Shonga (49 727) and Augustine Mulenga (40 630) are leading the pack with votes.
