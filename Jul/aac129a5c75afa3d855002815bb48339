AT four months old, baby Alunamda was simply too young to be part of a service delivery protest. And today her family is in mourning. Alunamda died after allegedly breathing in teargas fired by police during a community protest at Marikana squatter camp in Cape Town a week ago. The baby’s sad gogo, Thandiwe Mncedane (40), told Daily Sun at the weekend that Alunamda was fine before the protest. “We think the teargas fired by the police killed my grandchild,” she said. “It hurts to lose a child who was not even part of the protest. I don’t know why the police would fire teargas around our shacks.” Mum Akhona (16) said her baby struggled to breathe after allegedly inhaling the gas. “My baby was still so young. That’s why she couldn’t get air.” The community was protesting about the lack of service delivery. Community leader Xolani Thukwayo said he was shocked by the tragedy. “It’s painful because when police fire teargas they just do it. They don’t think about the kids.” Captain FC Van Wyk said an inquest docket was opened after the death of the four-month-old baby at Marikana squatter camp. “A post mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death,” said Van Wyk. The Mncedane family don’t have any money to bury their little one. “We’re depending on grant money for the two kids. We need all the help we can get,” said grieving Thandiwe.
