Deputy
Chief Justice Raymond Zondo does not have a twitter account. The
Office of the Chief Justice has warned the public and social media users
against a fake twitter account purporting to be that of Zondo. The
twitter handle is @RaymondZondo.  The
last tweet read: “The attacks the judiciary is facing are unnecessary and
devoid of any merit. If anyone has evidence regarding the 'capture' of any
judge by politicians or any entity, they should come forward.” On
Wednesday, in a statement, the office said: “The Deputy Chief Justice does not
have a Twitter account, nor has an account been created for him by the Office
of the Chief Justice. “The
views expressed on the parody Twitter account do not represent those of the
Deputy Chief Justice or the South African Judiciary,” it said. In
addition, the office also reminded the public that Chief Justice Mogoeng
Mogoeng still does not have a twitter account using the handle
@Mogoeng_Mogoeng. “The
views expressed on this account also do not represent those of the Chief
Justice or the South African Judiciar,” added the office of the Chief Justice.
