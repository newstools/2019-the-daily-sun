FUMING residents of Merry Pebble Stream Village outside Thulamahashe, Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, have shut down the Merry Pebble Stream library. This is because they are demanding answers about a group of workers who were allegedly hired without being interviewed. On Monday, residents chased away all the workers at the library after saying they want the Department of Culture, Sport and Recreation to explain the hiring process. Early in May during the opening of the library, MEC Thandi Shongwe pleaded with the same residents to not protest outside the gates when they need service delivery. She asked them  not to protest in front of the library gate when they demand services butto protect it for the benefit of the future generation. But this has fallen on deaf ears. Residents claim that ghost workers were hired to work at the facility during ex-chief whip’s reign at the Bushbuckridge Municipality. Peace Sithole told Daily Sun the community took a decision to suspend activities at the library. “We want those contracts to be suspended because they will not continue to work here until the process of hiring is brought out in the open,” said Sithole. Spokeswoman for the department Sibongile Nkosi said the officials are temporarily placed in the library by both the municipality and the department. She said both entities are responsible for finalising the appointments, which involves capturing of all applications, short listing, interviewing and vetting. “We have four EPWP workers from Bushbuckridge municipality, one EPWP from the department, one acting librarian from the municipality and another library assistant from our department,” she said.
