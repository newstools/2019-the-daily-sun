Since 9 August 2015, founder of Celebration of Life, Kamo Magabane has been hosting a Women's Day event thatÂ  aims at celebrating women. The redefining Beauty campaign brought to you by celebration of life and all things good portrays the beauty that is the female body in all shades, shapes and sizes. Through photography, this campaign seeks to give every woman who has defined her beauty by other people's standards a chance to see how gorgeous she truly is and also gives her the opportunity to formulate her own definition of beauty. If we are all different, what makes us think it is reasonable to subscribe to a single view or universal idea of beauty? So much of the beliefs and thoughts we keep and the decisions we make as women are directly in relation to what the world thinks about women and it's time to change that perception. It's time for every woman to shed the misconceptions, take off the labels and take charge in expressing her own definition of what beauty is or what it means to her. This event gives us as women a chance to evaluate our internal beliefs and some of the effects that external beauty standards has on us. With the overall theme "Love your body" the campaign seeks to affirm women from all walks of life.
