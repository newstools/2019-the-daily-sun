MOGALAKWENA Municipality whistleblower Ralph Kanyane was buried yesterday. The 33-year-old was laid to rest in his home village of Bakenburg, Limpopo, after he and Municipal Public Accounts Committee Chairman Valtyn Kekana were gunned down in Mokopane on Tuesday. It was believed Kekana was about to table a report on financial irregularities in the previous financial year. Ralph’s sister Florence Maroga said she knew her brother died for the truth. ANC PEC member and arts and culture, MEC Thandi Moraka, said: “Premier Stan Mathabatha cannot allow such killings to continue. He has already met with Police Minister Bheki Cele to bring a special unit to Mogalakwena to ensure the killers are arrested. “We know the Mokopane Police are captured as this is the fourth political killing here and those cases have not gone anywhere. We know this duo was vocal about corruption.” Waterberg ANC chairman Morris Mataboge said members had to defend their comrades. “Ralph was among our finest comrades,” he said. “We are calling upon the church to pray for the ANC. We cannot continue eating each other like this.” Two murder cases were opened and anyone with information is urged to contact Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501 or Captain Marcus Mofya at 078 817 8012.
