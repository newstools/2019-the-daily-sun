HE missed out on the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations finals. But Thulani Serero returns to Afcon action when Bafana Bafana tackle Morocco this afternoon. The Netherlands-based midfield ace was famously dropped for the finals in Equatorial Guinea, having failed to report for camp on time. He comes into the starting team as one of the three changes Stuart Baxter has made for the showdown with the Atlas Lions at Al Salaam Stadium. The 29-year-old takes the place of Sibusiso Vilakazi, who started against Namibia. Ronwen Williams replaces Darren Keet in goals while midfield anchor Kamohelo Mokotjo takes the place of Hlompho Kekana. Serero played four matches in the 2013 finals held in Mzansi and knows all about the pressure of securing a spot in the last 16 round.
