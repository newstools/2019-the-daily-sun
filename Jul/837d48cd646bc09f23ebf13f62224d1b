But the Zambian is not going on a hunt alone.“Of course, Billiat and I (we’ll be killers),” says a bullish Kambole. “Khama is a great player. It means a lot to be his teammate. I’m looking forward to playing alongside.” Kambole has been in touch with compatriots, the Bucs duo of Justin Shonga and Augustine Mulenga.But he insists: “There is no friendly match in a derby. “On the pitch there’s nothing like they are my brothers. Yes, they are my brothers, but on the day it’s going to be war. We are going to be enemies. Kambole added he wants to score goals and provide assists in the new season. Well, there can be no better stage for him to properly announce himself in local football than in the derby.
