A NEW Mzansi Magic series aims to tell stories about kings and queens who were in power before Africa was colonised. The series was produced by Bomb Productions. Teboho Mahlatsi, one of the creators and directors of the series, said they wanted to start with the story of Shaka Zulu. Teboho told SunBuzz the series will not only focus on royals but also on men and women who were great leaders. The story of Shaka will be called Shaka Ilembe and it will have three seasons. “Each season will have 10 episodes. The first one will be about the birth and rise to power of Shaka. “The second will be about how he conquered nations and brought them into the Zulu kingdom. The last one will be about the end of his life, focusing on how he was killed.” He said this series would be different from the one told about him by Joshua Sinclair in his book published in 1985 and his series broadcast the following year. “That series was told from a colonial perspective. “It even used English, but we want to be different and tell the story from an internal point of view. “We want to talk about the real events that happened there. Unlike the 1985 series, which focused on Shaka, we will focus on other kingdoms and other people around him such as his mum Nandi, his aunt Mkabayi and his brothers,” he said. Teboho said they want the series to compete with international shows such as Game of Thrones. “We don’t just want to show people the history of Africa, we want to entertain them as well. We want to create something that feels real, which is why we’ll use Zulu.” Teboho said they will start holding auditions next month. He called for dancers, praise poets, stick fighters and any people who think they have talent, to attend.
