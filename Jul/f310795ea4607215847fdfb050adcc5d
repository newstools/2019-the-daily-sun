THESE workers are worried about their jobs. About 1 800 Star Line workers yesterday demanded a government bailout to keep the company’s buses running and to save jobs. They claimed government had threatened to take the buses off the road. The workers, under North West Transport Investment, protested outside the transport department’s offices in Tshwane. They said they were not happy with transport minister Fikile Mbalula’s speech on Saturday. They claimed he said he’d bring new buses from Gauteng to replace the company’s. The minister apparently said the company was failing commuters. Batswana Gare Depot chairman Lawrence Nkoko told Daily Sun: “We demand that the minister bail out the buses, rather than stopping their services because many workers will lose their jobs. “We admit our buses are old and are no longer giving good service, but we need a bailout to meet the commuters’ demands.” Shadrack Mokgoko, a shop steward for Transport and Allied Workers Union shop steward at Pretoria West Depot, said government needed to intervene and help National Transport Investment financially. “We say no to the privatisation of state-owned entities. We need a long-term contract of between seven and 12 years to assist us in our operations,” he said. The department’s chief director of public transport, Lesiba Manamela, received the protesters’ memorandum and promised to intervene within seven days.
