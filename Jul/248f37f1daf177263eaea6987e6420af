Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Gaston Sirino is happy to link up with fellow Uruguayan, Mauricio Affonso, in Chloorkop. Sirino, who had little trouble settling into life in the Absa Premiership since joining in 2018, is backing his compatriot to also hit the ground running. The diminutive midfielder contributed towards 33 goals in his 90 appearances for Downs, scoring 13 goals and providing 20 assists in all competitions. He played a key role for the Brazilians on their way to a record ninth Premiership title. Affonso, who joins fellow South Americans Ricardo Nascimento, Jose Ali Meza and Sirino at the club, will be hoping to contribute to more success. “We are getting along well already and he hasn’t been here for long,” Sirino told the Sundowns website. “I think he is going to do well and I believe we can form a strong partnership together this coming season for sure.” “From what I can see, we could form a dynamic partnership. Affonso has good touches, holds the ball off well and we have been linking up well in training. I think he will adapt to the football here.” Sirino also shared some words of advice with Affonso with regard to the CAF Champions League, which is a different challenge altogether. “I have spoken to Affonso about how tough it is to play in the Champions League,” added Sirino. "I told him the teams are physical and play at a very fast pace. So I am excited to see what we can do together. “I am excited about this new season. And I think if we are able to get a domestic title we would have done well. It is also important to keep pushing hard in the CAF Champions League, and this is why I am looking forward to travelling with Affonso out of the country for our pre-season.”
