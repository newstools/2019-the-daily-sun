GAUTENG Premier David Makhura visited Sebokeng Hospital yesterday. Makhura, who was accompanied by Health MEC Bandile Masuku, said the hospital in the Vaal was one of the worst performing in the province. However, he said it had improved from the bad state he found it in during a visit three years ago. “I’m glad to say there is an improvement today, but it’s not enough. There’s room for more,” he said. Makhura said the hospital was on a priority list. He said three years ago, staff complained about a lack of equipment, but the problem was resolved. Masuku said he added five more hospitals to his list of five worst performing facilities he wanted to improve. He said one of the priorities at Sebokeng was to appoint a CEO. The MEC said nurses and doctors didn’t like working at the hospital because of a lack of human resources, but his department was working on fixing the issue. The premier and MEC were accompanied by hospital staff and spoke to patients, who didn’t have much to complain about. Mama Nqobile Ndabezitha (54) said all they wanted was for things to move faster as they wasted a lot of time waiting for medicine. “We want government hospitals to be more like private hospitals. The services must be 100%,” he said.
