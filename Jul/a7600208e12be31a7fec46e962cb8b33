THE fight over land has not shown any sign of slowing down. Yesterday, Joburg Metro cops demolished new shacks near Lenasia, south of Joburg. This came after a group of people occupied an open field along the K43 road. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the cops had to withdraw and would return to demolish more shacks. “We don’t know where these people came from. We can’t confirm that at the moment,” he said. Two months ago, Daily Sun reported on clashes between land grabbers and cops in the same area. At the time, Councillor Vinay Choonie said he had written to Gauteng Premier David Makhura and President Cyril Ramaphosa about the issue. He said there was a gang illegally selling land to outsiders.
