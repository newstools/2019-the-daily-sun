ORLANDO Pirates unveiled their new home and away kit for the 2019/20 season. And while many Pirates fans were happy with the design that reminded them of the 1994/95 season, others on social media argued whether the team was inspired by Kaizer Chiefs’ jersey from the 2011/12 season. Ajax Cape Town said on Twitter: “It’s that time of the year again, kit launching. @OrlandoPirates, are you bringing SmackDown to the PSL?” “We think that we are doing well in copying from our rivals from Naturena.” Some people thought that Pirates just ripped off the Turkish team Besiktas’ jersey design. Orlando Pirates fans on the other hand like the new/old design. “Hopefully, the players understand the significance of this jersey.”
