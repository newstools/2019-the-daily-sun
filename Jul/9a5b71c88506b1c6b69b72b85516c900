She said since her husband, who was a police reservist, was killed, the family has never received any updates about the case. She said her husband Saddam (59) was shot in February, and she feels he’s being denied justice. Winnie, from Moloto Village near Kwamhlanga, in Mpumalanga, said her husband received a call on the fateful night to say there was a robbery in one of the local shops. “When he got to the scene he was shot and killed. My husband had worked as a police reservist for many years. When he met his death, he was the chairman of the community policing forum in the area,” Winnie said. “My husband was dedicated to his job. I want justice to prevail because he died in the line of duty.” Saddam’s daughter Sonto (35) said they tried to follow up on the case, but had no success. “When we arrived at the police station the cops gave us the cellphone number of the investigating officer. We called the officer but he said we must call later. When we called later, his phone was off.” Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the case was still under investigation. No arrests have been made. He said he has advised the investigating officer to keep in regular contact with the family.
