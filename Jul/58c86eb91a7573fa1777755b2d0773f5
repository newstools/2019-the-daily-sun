WHEN they saw how well their bishop was recovering after his illness, they felt hopeful. But just a few days later, members of the congregation received the shattering news that he had died. KwaMashu Christian Centre’s founder Bishop Zwelakhe Mzimela (71) died in a Durban hospital on Sunday. He had spent over a month there after suffering from kidney failure. Church spokesman pastor Mthetheleli Zulu told Daily Sun when they visited the bishop last week, he seemed to be doing well. “It’s painful for a giant leader like him to die but because we are Christians, we are comforted by the fact that he is now with God.” Zulu said Bishop Mzimela touched many around the world through the ministry he started more than 15 years ago. “He has three children. His daughter is married and he lived with the other two and his wife.” He said the funeral would be held on Saturday at the church in KwaMashu. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala sent his condolences to the family and the church. “Bishop Mzimela was unwavering in his faith and firm in his political beliefs. He comes from a family that played a huge role in the struggle.”
