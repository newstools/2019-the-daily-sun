THE Mbindas were forced to live on nothing last month after their grants were stolen. Gogo Vuyiswa Mbinda (62) from Ibika Village in Butterworth, Eastern Cape, said she was horrified when she went to withdraw her pension grant and her grandkids’ foster care grant early last month. There was supposed to be R4 000 in her account but when she went to the ATM, it was empty. A few days later, she went to report the matter to Sassa and was told a person in Durban had taken her money. Gogo Vuyiswa, who is diabetic, was so shocked she had to be rushed to hospital. “They promised to sort out the problem within 14 days but nothing happened. I didn’t even get the food parcel they promised me.” Provincial Sassa spokesman Luzuko Qina said:“Mbhinda was affected by a minor system error as she was using a private commercial bank account to receive her grants.” “The outstanding June payment will be paid once the recourse process is completed. She has since changed from a private commercial bank account to a Sassa card. “We have made an application for a food parcel. She will receive her social grant payment at the beginning of this month.”
