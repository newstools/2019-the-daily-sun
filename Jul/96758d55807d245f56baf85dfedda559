She said nobody was physically injured, but that the team on duty had been taken away for trauma counselling. The extent of the loot taken was not clear yet, as the staffers were waiting for police to investigate. According to the Minerals Council of South Africa, total diamond sales in 2018 came to R16.3bn. Yellow police tape was put up around the scene, and there was no visible damage to the shop's door, security gate, or windows.
