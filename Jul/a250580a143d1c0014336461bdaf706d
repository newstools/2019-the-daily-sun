TV and Radio personality Masechaba Ndlovu was robbed in her home at gun point yesterday. The former Metro FM drive time presenter shared the terrible news on her social media pages and her fans know that she was left unharmed and says that this reminded her of how many people go through what she went through. "My family and I experienced what many South Africans go through on a daily basis. Many don’t make it out alive. Sending a prayer to anyone out there who has had a similar experience. My heart goes out to you." she said. Masechaba added that the thieves fled with her car which was later recovered with the items they had stolen. " My car was recovered in Alex, after a police chase, approximately 30 minutes after the call out, with most of the contents still inside. The assailants fled on foot and are still at large."
