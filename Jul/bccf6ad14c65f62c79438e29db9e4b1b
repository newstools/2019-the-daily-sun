THE MINISTER of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa has joined a long list of dignitaries, who have come out in support of veteran sports presenter Robert Marawa on his new sports channel Marawa TV. Since announcing the news of his new station, Robert has been getting enormous support, even from the flamboyant minister of transport, Fikile Mbalula.

However, the axing has inspired the star to start this new venture.
