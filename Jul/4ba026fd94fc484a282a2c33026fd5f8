POLICE Minister Bheki Cele visited Philippi East, Cape Town yesterday, meeting families who had lost loved ones over the weekend. “People ask why I’m visiting the criminals. I tell them I’m visiting the parents who never wanted to give birth to criminals,” he said. Cele told residents he could not meet the 24 hour deadline the community handed over to local cops. He asked for five days. “I will be meeting the security cluster and on Wednesday I will meet community leaders to give them feedback.” Cele said more police officers would be sent to the area even if it meant borrowing from other areas. Residents complained there had not been a station commander for six months, which Cele promised to sort out. Community leader Lubabalo Maliti (36) said ministers made promises but none were kept. “The minister should send us tactical response team members as some cops are working with the thugs,” he said.
