POLICE are investigating a murder that took place in Mogogelo Village, North West. Captain Samuel Sebola said the dead Ethiopian worked for his brother at his shop. The brother found the man dead in his room on Tuesday after they had gone to the shop to look for him but couldn’t find him. “He called his phone but it was off. He then called his brothers to help him. They broke down the door of his room and were met by a bad smell.” He said after entering the room, the man’s body was found under his bed with both of his legs missing. “The victim also had an open wound at the back of his head. A murder case was opened and an investigation is under way.” The SunTeam went to the shop to speak to the man’s brother, who said he didn’t understand English. People in the area said they were saddened by what had happened. “We loved him and he was good to us. He was very close to his customers,” one resident said. Monama Ratau (27) said the man used to give them food on credit. “When we were broke and hungry we knew where to go,” she told Daily Sun.
