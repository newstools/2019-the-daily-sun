THE dead are supposed to rest in peace. But at Vanderbijlpark Cemetery, Vaal, heartless thugs steal tombstones. When the SunTeam visited the cemetery recently, over 10 tombstones were missing. Most of them were missing from section A. Resident Sizakele Ntuli (32) told Daily Sun they often saw men in vans inside the cemetery. “It’s not an everyday thing, but once in a while we see men carrying stones in the yard,” Sizakele told the People’s Paper. She said they’d assume the men were erecting tombstones. “But now we’re suspicious of why they only come in the evenings. “Now that you’re raising this issue with us, it makes sense that they’re there to steal tombstones,” she said. Emfuleni municipal spokesman Stanley Gaba said they were aware of the matter. “The municipality will start an investigation and work with law enforcement to protect tombstones and arrest those guilty of this shocking crime,” he told Daily Sun.
