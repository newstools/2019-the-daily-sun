THE family of a taxi boss who was allegedly killed by cops on Thursday morning want justice. Khulekani Buthelezi (37), originally from Nongoma in northern KZN, was shot and killed in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, in front of five relatives. His brother Zama (39) told Daily Sun that cops stormed the house. “There were six people in the house: three sleeping in the main bedroom and three in a second bedroom. “When the cops came in they tied everyone up with cable ties. “They forced the other five out of the house before shooting Khulekani.” He said the cops had told the family different stories: that Khulekani had fired at them first and was killed by a relative and not them. “If my brother was killed by his relatives, which gun did they use? None of them have guns. “Secondly, how do you shoot someone while your hands are tied?” said Zama. “We want justice to prevail because we believe police misused their powers.” Benoni cops spokeswoman Captain Nomsa Sekele said Ipid was investigating. “The deceased was shot by the police in defence. When they arrived, he shot at them,” she said. “In defence they shot back, fatally wounding him. Cases of attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition are being investigated by the police,” Sekele said.
