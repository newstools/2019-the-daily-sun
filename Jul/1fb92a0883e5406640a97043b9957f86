News24 reported that Gauteng police had confirmed to News24 that a man had died
after he was shot several times in his car while on his way to Olivedale. According
to police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini, the man was driving with his gardener
when he was attacked at around 18:00 by two men who were on motorbikes. "He
was shot through the window several times and died at the scene," Dlamini
said. News24
understands that the shooting may have been a hit, however Dlamini said the
motive behind the attack is unknown. A case of murder is being investigated. Alleged
underworld kingpin, Nafiz Modack, who was an associate to the former soccer star
told News24 that he was a family man and not one for "war". "My
comment [to] those who shot him[is they] should be afraid, very afraid. I know
who was after him," he said No suspects
have been arrested. Dlamini was
unable to confirm the man's name to News24. "[We]
cannot confirm his name now. [We] will wait for crime scene officers to confirm
if his family members haveÂ  been
informed," Dlamini said.   https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-well-known-former-bafana-bafana-player-gunned-down-20190715
