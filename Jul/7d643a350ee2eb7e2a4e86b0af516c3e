ALMOST every house in this kasi has a name on it. And this is apparently because residents have invaded these houses and claimed them as their own. This is to show they were reserving them. Some of the houses in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni, have not even been completed. But this hasn’t stopped desperate people from Thokoza, Kathlehong and nearby areas from grabbing the houses. A resident (43) said he was a soldier during the struggle and the houses were meant for MK and Apla veterans. “We felt the provincial government and Ekurhuleni Municipality are not giving us any attention, so we decided to take over,” he said. Thabo Papo, who said he wasn’t fast enough to get a house, said some people had even started marking stands in open spaces. MK Military Veterans Association spokesman and Ekurhuleni regional secretary Bafana Mahlabe said he was not aware of people writing their names on houses. But he confirmed they were meant for former figters. Ekurhuleni Housing MMC Lesiba Mpya said: “In the project in Palm Ridge Ext 10 and 12, the total yield is 6019. “We have dedicated 2 000 stands for the rapid release programme, where those who can afford to build for themselves will be given a fully serviced stand, subject to a qualification criteria.” He said they had also set aside 670 stands for MK veterans across all parties. “We have instructed our lawyers to approach the courts in seeking legal recourse. We will have to evict those who will not voluntarily vacate the houses,” he said.
