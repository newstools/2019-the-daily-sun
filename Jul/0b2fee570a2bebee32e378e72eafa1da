FORMER Ubuntu Cape Town top goal scorer Ranga “Chivas” Chivaviro, who has been loaned to TS Sporting in the National First Division (NFD) by Baroka FC, does not see the move as a downgrade. Chivaviro joined Baroka in July last year after finishing the NFD campaign as a second best top goal scorer with 13 goals in all competitions. But his one-season stint with the Limpopo-based Baroka was not a fruitful one as he played 18 games and only scored one goal. That saw him joining the long list of players such as Phumelele “Ace” Bhengu, Thabiso Kutumela and Sedwyn George, who joined PSL sides and failed to live up to expectations. The Mpumalanga-born Chivaviro said a loan move is something that he wanted to work hard on and regain his goal scoring mojo. “One could see the move to NFD as a step back, but it will help me than sitting on the bench in the PSL,” Chivaviro told SunSport yesterday. The 26-year-old admitted that he did not deliver at Baroka, so he cannot blame the club for loaning him out. He said: “I did not have a bad stay at Baroka. I featured in half of the matches. But you know as a striker your work is to score goals and I failed to do that. I only scored one which is a bad record for a striker. At some point, the team was not in a good position so the coach had to use players who are delivering the results.” However, Chivaviro has already started doing the job for Sporting as he was on target last week when the team played a 1-1 draw against PSL Champions Mamelodi Sundowns. “I just want to score goals. I know if I do well I will put myself in a good position of returning to PSL mid-season.” Chivaviro, who signed a three-year deal with Baroka, could not reveal how long is the loan move.
