GABISILE Ndlovu is begging SunReaders to help her find her son Siyabonga. The 43-year-old mum from Orange Farm, Joburg, told Daily Sun her son Siyabonga Mkhwanazi (21) went missing last month on his way back to his residence at the University of the North West. She said Siyabonga’s roommate told her he was missing, saying he had gone to visit a friend nearby but never returned. “He called me to ask if Siyabonga was with me. I told him he was not here and then I realised he was missing and panicked. ” Gabisile said when she called Siyabonga’s friend, he told her he last saw him on 12 June at about 7pm. She said a week ago, someone called her and said he was in Deneysville. “We tried to find him there without success. When I call the officer handling the case, he ignores my calls, so we have to handle this alone.” Siyabonga’s friend Veli Mgenge, who was the last to see him, said there were no taxis anymore when Siyabonga left his house, so he hitchhiked. “If I’d known he would go missing, I would have stopped him,” he said. Veli said Siyabonga was wearing a blue T-shirt, a charcoal denim jacket, blue jeans and green Nike trainers. Captain Fikile Funda said an inquiry case was opened. “We will do our best to find him. A lot of kids go missing during initiation season but we won’t rest until we find him,” Funda said.
