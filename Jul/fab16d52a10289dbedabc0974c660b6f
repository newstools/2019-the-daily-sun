OUTSPOKEN TV host Ntsiki Mazwai is known for not being shy to voice out her feeling about anything, so it comes as no surprise that she had answer for a tweep, who dug up her old picture, in which she appeared naked as a park of a campaign against rape. A Twitter user by the name of Kagiso posted a picture of the star in her birthday suit, but that didn’t bother Ntsiki, who instead schooled him about what the picture was about and what it represents for her as a victim of rape. “Who is she? “reads the tweet posted by Kagiso. Ntsiki defended herself, saying that was the woman, who had overcome rape. “The woman who gave birth to the new generation of feminists. Used her naked body to defy rapists. She said, &quot;Even if I&#39;m naked....it does notmean I want to be raped&quot;- Ntsiki Mazwai MBOKODO,” she twitted.
