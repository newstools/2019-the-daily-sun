ACCORDING to the bones, Bafana Bafana will beat Egypt at the Afcon Cup tomorrow. Sangoma Nzama Maluleke from Meadowlands, Soweto, told Daily Sun he woke up with this happy knowledge yesterday morning. “In my dream on Wednesday night, women were ululating and men were whistling,” said Nzama. “We were blowing vuvuzelas and kids were running around. I needed to clarify what the dream meant and I threw my bones. “They showed me Bafana beating Egypt tomorrow. Nzama said at first he found this hard to believe as the team had not been playing well. “I threw the bones again and they gave the same answer.” Nzama said he’s been a sangoma for more than 10 years and the bones never lie to him.
