After
a long battle with infertility, Nigerian couple, Uchenna and James Okeigbo, are
now the proud parents of 3 boys and 2 girls, a journey that began 18 years ago,
reports Legit.ng. The
quintuplets were conceived via IVF, and it would be Grace Ogoke, the same
obstetrician who advised the pair to try fertility treatment, who would
eventually deliver their 5 babies. "After
going through all their investigations, I saw that they would need to be
assisted, that spontaneous pregnancy, medically speaking, might not be
achievable, and I advised them to be assisted," said Grace. According
to the obstetrician, it had been her first time delivering this many babies via
C-Section. "It
is a relief and achievement for all of us and I thank God for that," said
the specialist. Although
overjoyed, the 42-year-old mom, Uchenna, said that the birth had been hard,
"It is not easy to have five children at once," she said, crediting
her husband, James, for his support. The
47-year-old dad was in turn just as grateful to his wife for not giving up on
their longstanding desire to have children. "I
thank my wife for retaining her respect for me for [these] 18 years of childlessness
without quarreling with me. I am also grateful to her family for standing by
us." While
elated, the family are concerned about the financial burden of raising 5
infants all in one go and have called for governmental assistance. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eight-month-old-cape-town-baby-back-home-from-hospital-after-rape-20190703
