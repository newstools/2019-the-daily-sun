MEMBERS of a police choir on Friday opened their hearts and wallets to a destitute family. The family of six from Rolle Village, outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, were left stranded in 2016 after their shack was burnt to the ground. The mother of the children allegedly endured further hardship when she suffered physical abuse at the hands of her husband, who later left the family. The starving mother and children approached social workers for help. Their sad story touched the men and women in blue in the province. Social worker Dan Mabunda told Daily Sun: “We conducted an investigation and found the situation was really bad. No one in the family was working and the children could not get social grants after their IDs and birth certificates were destroyed by the fire. “We joined forces with Mhala police. Now we’re in the process of working with the department of home affairs to ensure they get new birth certificates and IDs. “We’ll continue to provide the mother with counselling for the domestic violence she went through,” said Mabunda. Choir leader Captain Mthuthuzeli Majeke said it was part of their programme to identify needy families and offer help. The 30-year-old mum, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the children, said it was hard for her family to survive. “I’m speechless. I didn’t expect this to happen. My children and I are very grateful for what has been done for us,” she said. --
