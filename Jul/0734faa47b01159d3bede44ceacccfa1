MORE than 50 angry residents from Govan Mbeki kasi, Port Elizabeth, shut down their councillor’s office on Friday. They claimed two office assistants robbed a man of R18 000 after promising him an RDP. Residents stormed the office, demanding answers. They also ordered the two assistants to leave, but they refused. They then burnt tyres outside the office until Metro cops intervened. Vuyo Mbale (48) said: “I was desperately looking for a house and I went to the councillor’s office. Her two assistants said I’d get the RDP if I paid R18 000, but nothing happened.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We can only follow through once a case is opened with the cops. The councillor and municipal officials will talk to the residents.”
