SEEING other people getting RDPs while she and her children sleep in a damaged mud house has been tearing Qabukile Ntuli apart. The 46-year-old mum of four from Zitholeni in KwaNyuswa, west of Durban, told Daily Sun her two rondavels collapsed during a storm in 2017. Qabukile said she informed a ward committee member, who promised she would get an RDP last year. But she was left behind when construction on a local RDP housing project began. She said she contacted the committee member several times, and he kept saying he’d get her a house. “Now he doesn’t answer my phone calls,” she said. Councillor Themba Shelembe advised Qabukile to contact her. “This is a five-year housing project. Phase one has been finished and phase two will start in two months,” he said.
