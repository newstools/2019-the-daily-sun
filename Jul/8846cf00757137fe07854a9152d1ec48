AT least six people were bust after they blew the whistle on thugs digging up copper cables! Community leader Nolubabalo Mtshalala from Thembani in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, was one of the people arrested. She said cops had failed to arrest the real criminals. “They arrested us instead!” said Nolubabalo. She said police arrested a 65-year-old madala who had copper cables in his backyard. “The madala struggles to walk. He’s sick and is always indoors sleeping,” she said. Residents were arrested because they wanted police to release the madala. “The criminals were shooting at passers-by while they were digging for cables. We never saw the cables they were hiding in the backyard.” Sonwabo Plata (65) said he was shocked when they kicked in the door of his shack. “I almost died in the police cell. I begged the police to bring my medication but they refused,” said Sonwabo. “I don’t know why I was treated like a criminal. I hardly go outside because I’m sick.” Thando Sapula (38) was in the cells from 4 to 9 July. “We didn’t appear in court the following day, and we never did anything wrong.” Residents said they wanted the police who arrested them to pay for what they did. Sergeant Balo Malo said Khayelitsha police confirmed that a case of interfering with police duties was opened following an incident in Thembani. “Six suspects between the ages of 23 and 65 years were arrested,” said Malo. He said that all six suspects appeared in court.
