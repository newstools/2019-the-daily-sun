AFTER municipal officials made a number of visits to the site of the Dobsonville Social Housing Project, the area’s issues seem closer to being resolved. On Monday, officials, including Joburg housing MMC Meshack van Wyk, visited the Joburg Social Housing Company’s open day in Dobsonville, Soweto. They also launched a help desk where people could make rental applications or inquire about RDP houses. Willington Simelane from the Joburg Social Housing Company said more than 200 people attended and applications were put in for rental opportunities. “This development caters for residents who earn a monthly income of between R1 500 and R15 000,” said Simelane. He said units would be rented out for between R850 a month to R3 700, depending on the size of the flat.
