AFTER Sizakele Tonisi heard he had been approved for an RDP in 2013, he was overjoyed. But six years later, he is miserable because a stranger is living in the house meant for him. The 60-year-old from Missionvale kasi in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun he reported the matter to his previous councillor and housing officials. “They told me I shared a house number with this person, but I asked them how this could be as she’s a stranger to this community. The officials just told me to go back to my shack because there was nothing they could do for me.” Sizakele said the problem had started affecting his health. “Every time it rains, I get sick because my shack is leaking and cold while someone else is in my RDP. “I suffer from heart disease because I always think about my house. Doctors say I’m sick because of stress. Since it started getting cold, I have been coughing every night. “What makes it worse is that kids own houses while I’m still trapped in a shack.” According to community leaders, housing projects in Missionvale were full of illegal occupants. Sizakele’s neighbour Dylan Plaatjies (27) said: “When we were born, madala was already living here.” Daily Sun sent an inquiry to Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki, who said he could not comment. He advised the madala to approach his ward councillor for help.
