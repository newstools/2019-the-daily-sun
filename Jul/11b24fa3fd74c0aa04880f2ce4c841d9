THE driver of a truck carrying more than R1 million worth of scrap metal was shot and killed in a hijacking on Monday night. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the driver, Absalom Mnisi (53), was flagged down by about seven men wearing reflective jackets and a white vehicle with a blue light near Coega, Nelson Mandela Bay. He said the white Volvo truck was later located at Makepeace Crescent in Port Elizabeth by a vehicle tracking company. “A flying squad vehicle found it hidden behind a warehouse and on entering the premises, seven suspects fled into the building,” said Beetge. “On searching the warehouse, cops managed to arrest five suspects aged between 27 and 41.” Beetge said almost 23 tons of scrap copper worth R1,9 million and a Mini Cooper vehicle were recovered. “On the scene, cops also found a white Ford Ranger rental vehicle with a blue light, a reflective jacket, a mobile radio frequency signal blocker and seven cellphones.” Mnisi’s body was spotted by a motorist close to the N2 highway at 9.30am yesterday. He had gunshot wounds to his back and neck. “Murder and hijacking cases were opened and were being investigated,” said Beetge. “All five suspects have been charged with possession of stolen property and police will investigate their role in the hijacking and murder,” he said. Beetge said anyone with information should contact Lieutenant-Colonel Willie Mayi on 082 697 5914.
