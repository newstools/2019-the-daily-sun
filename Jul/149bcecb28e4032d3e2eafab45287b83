AFTER HE used the magosha’s services, he didn’t have money – so he offered her a handgun instead.The unsuspecting woman accepted the weapon, hoping to sell it to get the money she was owed. NOW THE POOR MAGOSHA IS BEHIND BARS, CAUGHT WITH AN ILLEGAL FIREARM! Captain Johannes Ramphora said the magosha (28) was bust after trying to sell the gun for R500 at a gun shop in Springs, east of Joburg on Saturday. “The gun shop owner became suspicious and contacted the cops,” he said. He said when they got there, the magosha told them she serviced her client and was expecting R150, but after the job was done the man said he didn’t have any money. “Investigations indicate the .357 revolver was used during a business robbery which took place on 25 June in Springs. It belonged to a security company,” said Ramphora. “Cops are looking for the man who gave the gun to the woman to explain where he got it from. We are not sure if he was part of the robbery.” Ramphora said that kind of weapon costs between R3 000 and R5 000. The magosha appeared in the Springs Magistrates Court on Monday for possession of a suspected stolen weapon. The case has been postponed for further investigation. “She’s still in custody as cops are busy with the investigation,” he said. “We advise sex workers to be vigilant and not to get into situations that can get them into trouble with the law.” Daily Sun spoke to some magoshas working in the area who said they often face the problem of customers who can’t pay. “After they are done they don’t want to pay. We are not here because we want to, we have our children to support,” said a magosha. “We feel pity for our sister. She’s in trouble now but all she wanted was to try and get the money owed her. She’s lucky because some customers try to kill you if you demand what is due to you.”
