 A video of a speeding motorist reaching over 322km/h on a public road has surfaced on social media. The video of the speeding motorist was filmed on the R21 in Johannesburg. Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee shared the video on Twitter with the caption: “VIDEO as received: R21 JHB. This madness must be stopped!” On the tweet Abramjee tagged Transport minister Fikile Mbalula, Gauteng Community Safety and the Road Traffic Management Corporation. In the video, the speedometer of the car shows that it was travelling at 175km/h, the car then accelerates to 241km/ as the motorist switches lanes from the fast lane to the middle. It seems the motorist was racing against a motorbike, which looks to be also speeding. Towards the end of the video, the car was travelling at the speed of 322KM/H. Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) has condemned racing on public roads. The EMPD said racing on public roads is dangerous behavior and will never be tolerated by the department. EMPD spokesperson Wilfred Kgasago said drivers caught driving over 200km/h will be arrested with no bail granted until court appearance after 48 hours.
