HER two sons Vuyo (12) and Junior (8) were watching TV on Wednesday night while she was ironing their clothes in another room. Suddenly, the house was engulfed in flames. “I heard my daughter Mpumi (18) screaming for help after she was trapped in the passageway by flames that were apparently coming from one of the bedrooms,” said mum Sophy Milaza (57) from Oakley, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. They all managed to escape the evil flames, but only with the clothes on their backs. Almost everything was destroyed in the fire. “Neighbours came out running and called the firefighters and police for help. We don’t know what caused the fire,” she said. Shocked family friend Thembinkosi Zwane said: “We rushed out to help after hearing the family frantically shouting. “We threw sand and sprayed water on the house, but the fire kept on spreading quickly.” Sophy’s shocked son Selby (37) said he had just knocked off when he received a call that his home was on fire. “I don’t know how I reached home from Emalahleni after hearing the sad news. But I’m thankful to God my family is safe,” he said, “My mum couldn’t even talk as she was crying. The fire ate everything, including my siblings’ school uniforms, cash, IDs, birth certificates, clothes, food and furniture. We have to start life from scratch.”
