ANOTHER commuter train has been torched in Cape Town. Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said the rail commuter agency was still investigating the cause of Monday night’s incident in Blackheath in which two passengers had minor injuries. “Train No 3230 was bound for Cape Town from Strand when a fire was reported on board a motor coach between Melton Rose and Blackheath stations,” Scott said. She said two passengers were injured as they jumped off the train. A motor coach and an adjoining passenger carriage were damaged. This is the third train-torching incident in Cape Town in the past four months. In April and May, Metrorail lost train coaches after they were destroyed by fire at Cape Town Station. Civic organisation #Unitebehind has called on the government to improve rail transport. It said it was concerned at reports that R2 billion was to be diverted from Prasa to Sanral to help with the e-tolls debt. “Shifting money from rail to road in unacceptable. We understand Prasa has not been able to spend its capital allocation but that is because there has been no disaster management plan,” it said.
