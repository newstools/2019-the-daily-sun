TO be stressed every time one has to answer the call of nature stinks to high heavens. But residents of Nelson Mandela Bay say their municipality doesn’t understand this. Residents of Port Elizabeth’s Westville squatter camp have demanded to be allowed to keep their pit toilets until the municipality provides enough bucket toilets. The municipality started developing the area after residents blocked roads with burning tyres and torched vehicles. Although they appreciated the move to make their lives better, they insisted their pit toilets must not be done away with. Community leader Sipho Ntsondwa (43) told Daily Sun: “Our pit toilets are better than these bucket toilets. For 18 years we have been using pit latrines and they make us feel safe and relaxed. “Last year, the municipality gave us only 300 bucket toilets for about 1 500 people. This is dehumanising because our families are big. When you relieve yourself, you have to rush because someone else is waiting. “We understand the municipality is busy with service delivery, but we need toilets. Our pit toilets will remain until the municipality gives us enough bucket toilets.” Nomonde Gwedashe said residents were worried about contracting infections. “These toilets are not emptied on wet days because our streets are muddy. Pit toilets are also helpful when we have traditional functions and funerals,” she said. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the best way to eradicate the bucket toilet system was to build houses with flushing toilets. “However, this continues to be a challenge as the budget for housing delivery is with the national government. “As a temporary measure we offer ablution facilities for people to use. The plan is to eradicate the buckets completely,” Mniki said.
