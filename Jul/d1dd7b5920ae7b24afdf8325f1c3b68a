Following a spate of
attacks on paramedics, the City of Johannesburg has now come up with interim
measures. The Metro police will
now escort the Emergency Services crews when attending to identified hot spot
areas, to render their services. This was revealed by
the Public Safety Acting Head of Department David Tembe, during a media
briefing on Wednesday. On Saturday, the
emergency crew was attacked by angry community members in Cosmo City, north of
Joburg. It is understood that
they were attacked for providing medical care to a man believed to have
murdered someone in the area. After the incident,
the City announced to have withdrawn its services to Cosmo City. Tembe said this was
not a sustainable measure but they needed to act faster to protect lives. He said: “The police
vehicle will escort emergency vehicles from 10 at night until 6 in the morning,
these are high risk times. “The safety of
employees and that of the community is primary to the public safety department,
and a number of measures have been introduced to provide safety of
fire-fighters while on scenes,” said Tembe.
