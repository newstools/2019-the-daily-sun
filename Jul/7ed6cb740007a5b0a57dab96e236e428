The crimen injuria case against Adam Catzavelos has been delayed yet again in the Randburg Magistrate's Court. This was to allow the Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to consider representations submitted by his lawyer, Lawley Shain. Shain submitted the 68-page representations on July 5.  The court, however, did not get to hear the contents of the said representations on Wednesday, as the matter was postponed to August 29. Catzavelos landed in hot water when a selfie video he shot - in which he used the k-word slur - went viral in August 2018. While holidaying on a beach in Greece, Catzavelos made racist comments about the lack of black people in his surroundings. In the video, he celebrated the fact there were no black people on the beach. "Not one k***r in sight. F*king heaven on earth... You cannot beat this!" he said in the video. In his previous appearance, his lawyer alerted the media that Catzavelos had received a letter from Greek authorities. 'The sooner he is convicted, the better' The letter, which is written in Greek, states in summary that he is facing charges relating to the "intention to publicly - via internet - incite, provoke, excite or [encourage] acts or actions which may cause discrimination, hatred or violence against a person or group; or persons identified by race, colour, religion, genealogy, national or ethnic origin, gender; or threatens the lives or freedom of such persons", his lawyer explained to the media following his brief court appearance. "He will go to Greece when he has to; the date, however, has not been set," Shain said. The EFF in Gauteng, which initially laid a charge of crimen injuria against Catzavelos, is unhappy with the delay in this matter. SOURCE: News24
