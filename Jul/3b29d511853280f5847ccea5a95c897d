ANC Tshwane chairman Kgosi Maepa said they want the auditor-general to get back the money irregularly spent by the DA/EFF coalition in the Tshwane Municipality. Maepa was briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday about the findings of the auditor-general. The City of Tshwane had R5 billion irregular expenditure during the previous financial year. He called for Lebogang Maile, MEC for Traditional Affairs, to intervene in the municipality and put the city under administration. He said that failure to intervene could lead to a total collapse. “The city failed to spend half of its R4 billion capital expenditure budget. This is money meant for new infrastructure for housing, roads and libraries,” he said. Maepa called for the suspension of city manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola and said he must be held liable for the irregular and illegal appointment of GladAfrica. The auditor-general found that GladAfrica was irregularly appointed to assist with the roll-out of infrastructure projects worth millions. He said the ANC was calling for a special council sitting before 10 July to suspend the city manager. He also questioned the qualifications and appointments of senior officials, including chief of Emergency Medical Services Previn Govender and chief of the Metro police Lieutenant-General Johanna Nkomo. He accused Govender of lying about his qualifications and Nkomo of not having a diploma in traffic management.
