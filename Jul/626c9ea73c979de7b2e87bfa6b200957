STRANGE screams can be heard from an abandoned mine building at night. Speaking to Daily Sun, some people from Everest and Gugulethu squatter camp said the building was spooky and they wanted the Ekurhuleni Municipality to demolish it. Residents said the building was connected to a shaft and residents used to commit suicide there years ago. The People’s Paper wrote an article about how residents wanted the shaft to be sealed five years ago. Community leader Celani Mngomezulu said: “We fear one day we’ll find a body inside that building if something is not done soon.” Lesego Moloi said the voices in the building were loud as if people were screaming inside it. Captain Johannes Ramphora said before the shaft was closed by the municipality two years after Daily Sun’s article, there were cases of people reported missing and not being found. Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said the building belonged to Grootvlei Mine and they would send officials to investigate.
