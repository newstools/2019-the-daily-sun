South Africa has revised its visa requirements for certain countries, including New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Minister of Home Affairs (DHA) Aaron Motsoaledi, announced the new list of visa-free countries at the Budget Vote 2019, earlier on Wednesday. The new list is as follows - with roll-out under way and full implementation set for November 2019. The new visa programme is no longer subjected to a reciprocal policy usually required by Department of International Relations (DIRCO), says Motsoaledi, as this is in the best interest of travel and tourism to SA. - Qatar - United Arab Emirates - New Zealand - Saudi Arabia - Cuba - Ghana - Sao Tome and Principe
