MINISTER Nathi Mthethwa has taken the baton from his predecessor Tokozile Xasa in the fight to find justice for the embattled Caster Semenya,  who has been under attack from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The IAAF has made a ruling that female athletes with the higher level of testosterone in the 400m and 800m fields must take blockers that will reduce their levels. But earlier in June the Switzerland federal supreme court suspended an IAAF’s ruling restricting testosterone levels in female runners, which meant Semenya could continue to compete pending a final judgement. Now Mthethwa has put on his fighting gloves: “We will fight to the bitter end... They are trying to deter Semenya, but they will fail. They will continue to fail and, as government, we will leave no stone unturned to make sure South Africa’s favourite daughter wins her fight against them.” Xasa has been more vocal on the Semenya fight against the IAAF and Mthethwa surely felt the need to carry on with the fight, as the majority of athletics bodies around the world are in her corner. “Semenya is a fighter herself,” Mthethwa said without mincing his words. “We will file papers and fight on her behalf because what is happening to her is injustice. She is experiencing the same kind of discrimination suffered by many Africans. “I think of the late Khoi Khoi woman who also suffered a great deal of humiliation. It’s not about the sport but about discrimination. We have fought all kinds of injustices in this country and won, and we will not rest until Caster wins.” But Mthethwa is aware they are racing against time, with just over a month to go before the IAAF World Championships scheduled for Doha, Qatar in September. The 28-year-old Semenya, the double Olympic and world 800m women’s champion, is on stand-by for the Championships until a final decision is taken on her court battles.
