BEWARE of social media scammers! They’ll take your money and disappear. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi warned people to stop getting involved in social media activities where money’s involved. “Those agreements don’t end well.” He told Daily Sun many men had come forward to complain. “Usually the woman agrees to come to the man’s place but then asks for transport money,” said Hlathi. “The excited man makes the deposit but then comes the wake-up call. The woman blocks the man from social media, blocks the calls and disappears.” Dumsane Ndamane (30) from Vereeniging, Vaal, said he once arranged to meet a beautiful woman. “She was from the North West. I deposited R500 for her but she never came. She blocked me everywhere,” he said. Simphiwe Shandu (39) from Joburg said: “I dated a girl from Cape Town. We arranged for her to visit me but she had no money. “I sent her R1 000 but that was the last time I heard from her.” Police said men could open a case of false pretences. Kabokweni cop shop in Mpumalanga posted on Facebook on Wednesday: “If you send money for anyone to come over and he or she doesn’t pitch and fails to refund your money, you can file a case of theft under false pretence. “He or she can be jailed for up to seven years.” On the Daily Sun Facebook page, men were happy to hear this. Mabwedza said: “Finally, I’ve seen the law applied in our favour because these cousins of Jezebel are very good at using us.” Khorula said: “These girls lie and take our money. Some are not even the people on their profile pics.”
