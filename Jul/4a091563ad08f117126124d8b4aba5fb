WHEN you are a celebrity, it means your diary is always full of commitments and everyone wants your attention. This is why some stars decide to escape their busy schedules by treating themselves to sabbaticals. Actor and television personality Lunga Shabalala has taken a little hiatus from the hustle and bustle of Joburg by treating himself to a holiday in Maldives, Asia. The star has been showing off his well-toned body while on holiday in the island. While his character on 1Magic’s The River Lindani can only dream of a holiday in Maldives, the Lunga is having a great down letting his hair down. In interviews, the star shared how despite being a familiar face he was rejected at auditions. "I have auditioned so many times on so many shows and the one thing you get used to in this industry is rejection; you don't put too much faith in the process regardless of how well you do. At that point, I was content that I gave myself the chance and opportunity to feature if it does happen,” he told Zalebz. Walking through paradise like... #centaramaldives #PriorityTravelClub ??????
