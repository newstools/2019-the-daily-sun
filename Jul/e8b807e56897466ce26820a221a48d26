IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala has expressed sadness following the shooting of Aubrey Baardman yesterday. Baardman, the party’s PR councillor in KwaDukuza, was shot and injured on the N2 on the KZN North Coast while driving with his family. Gwala said Baardman, his wife and a family member were rushed to hospital. “In our province we have this narrative that politicians are being killed and we don’t know if it’s common crime or political attacks,” he said. “Either way, we want the police to arrest the suspects so the truth can be uncovered.” “We wish them a speedy recovery as they’re receiving medical attention in hospital,” said Gwala. KwaDukuza mayor Dolly Govender said that after being shot, Baardman drove to the Lavoipierre Building municipal offices. “Luckily, his condition was not critical. A family member was also shot,” said Govender. She said crime prevention unit cops had escorted the family to hospital. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Baardman and his family were driving towards KwaDukuza at about 7am when they were attacked by unknown suspects. “They fired shots at them. A family member sustained a leg injury and the man was injured in the neck.
