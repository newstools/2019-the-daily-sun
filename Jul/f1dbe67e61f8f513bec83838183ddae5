JOHAN Bothma, who was bust for moering a pastor because was wearing an EFF cap, was in court yesterday. When he entered the Roodepoort Magistrates Court, angry EFF members called for his blood. “Voetsak, racist!” were some of the calls that came from the gallery. The case was postponed to 18 July. Bothma, wearing a black leather jacket, blue shirt and blue jeans, left the court through the back entrance. He faces one count of assault and one of crimen injuria for allegedly using the k-word. He attacked Ron Rambebu at a petrol station in Roodepoort. Prosecutor Isaac Masete asked for a postponement for further investigation and to get a statement from a witness who was at the scene. Bothma handed himself over to cops over the weekend after a video showed him approaching the grey Mercedes- Benz and throwing punches through the car’s open window before the car drove off. Rambebu, who saw his alleged attacker for the first time since the incident, said he felt some anger. “I want to give the court a chance to do its work. “I want to allow the process of the court to continue. “I believe we’ll have a victory at the end of the day,” he said.
