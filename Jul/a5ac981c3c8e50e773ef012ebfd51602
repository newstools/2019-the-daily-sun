MPUMALANGA Education MEC Bonakele Majuba has urged parents to work with government to restore order in schools. He and the police made a surprise raid at Bhekiswako Secondary School in Mahushu near Hazyview yesterday. Police seized cellphones and knives. Majuba said the school had a challenge, caused mainly by the community. “We heard intruders come to the school to attack pupils. “We’re going to come with ways and means of stabilising the school. We’ll speak to the community. “We’re concerned about safety in schools. “We want to appeal to schools and communities to ensure safety around schools. “We don’t want drug dealers and criminals to go into schools and rob children.” Majuba said they’d continue raiding schools because they wanted to ensure all schools were safe. “Last week, a pupil was stabbed to death at Barberton Secondary School, while another sustained a stabbing injury at Bhekiswako. “A pupil from another school allegedly entered a grade 8 class and attacked a 17-year-old while the teacher was busy.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the community had a serious problem if pupils behaved like this.
