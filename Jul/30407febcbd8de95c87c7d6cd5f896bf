Suspended eThekwini mayor Zandile
Gumede has expressed her pain at the way the ANC communicated her extended
suspension through the media. Speaking through her spokesman
councillor Nkosenhle Madlala the mayor said she was shocked and concerned that
she only learned through the media that she won't be allowed to return to her
office today. This after ANC provincial secretary
Mdumiseni Ntuli addressed the media on Wednesday and said the mayor's leave of
absence has been extended pending the finalisation of the investigation by the
task team that was established to assess her capabilities to lead the
municipality. This after she was arrested and
released on bail.  Ntuli also cited the mayor’s strict
bail conditions as part of the assessment whether she will be to discharge her
duties. Madlala said the mayor felt
undermined that no one from the ANC thought of informing her about changes in
her leave. The mayor also lashed out at the
police for arresting her supporters and journalists.  She said what she saw reminded her of
apartheid brutality. Among those arrested were the Councillor's
supporter’s leader Mzo Dube. At the time of writing their
lawyers were still negotiating their release.
