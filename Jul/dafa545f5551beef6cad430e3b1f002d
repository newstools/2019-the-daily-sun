ELDORADO Park cops are concerned about the rise in human trafficking cases in the kasi. As a result, police have urged community members in the kasi south of Joburg to stay vigilant. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, cops spokeswoman Constable Fezeka Khobo said: “Eldorado police have received complaints from human trafficking survivors. “So we decided to educate the community about human trafficking, how people are trafficked, and what causes it, in order for people to take care of themselves. Khobo outlined what human trafficking really is and how it can be avoided. How people get trafficked: - Promises of employment or opportunities abroad - Deception and false promises - Some victims respond to job ads - Others are sold by family members, friends or a family friend. According to a UN Office and Drugs and Crime report, forced labour accounts for a third of victims in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.
