AN Eastern Cape pupil has died after a
tree fell on him during breaktime. TimesLive reports that Asenathi Gani
(10), died at Lusikisiki Village Junior Secondary School on Monday after a
gumtree branch fell on him. “The 10-year-old was among three grade
6 learners who were involved in this incident. Unfortunately St Elizabeth
hospital, which initially admitted all three of them, had to airlift Gani to
Mthatha where he later succumbed due to the seriousness of his head injuries,”
Eastern Cape education department spokesman Mali Mtima said in a statement on
Tuesday. “Other learners who were involved in this
incident and were taken by ambulance to St Elizabeth hospital with him included
12-year-old Lindokuhle Dweba and 11-year-old Alindwe Nqubula … Lindokuhle Dweba
had a middle finger injury. The finger was later amputated to stop the
bleeding. Alondwe Nqubula suffered a left shoulder injury.” The hospital later discharged the two.
