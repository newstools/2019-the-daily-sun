JUVENTUS star Cristiano
Ronaldo will not face charges after being accused of sexual assault, US
prosecutors say. Kathryn Mayorga, 34, had alleged
that the Juventus player raped her at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. She reportedly reached an
out-of-court settlement with the Portuguese star in 2010, but sought to reopen
the case in 2018. He denied the allegations. In a statement on Monday, Las
Vegas prosecutors said the claims could not "be proven beyond reasonable
doubt". The Clark County District
Attorney's office said the victim reported an assault in 2009, but refused to
state where it had happened or who the attacker was. As a result police were
unable "to conduct any meaningful investigation". In August 2018, Las Vegas police
investigated the alleged crime again at the request of the victim. But the statement added:
"Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of
sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt. Therefore, no charges will be forthcoming." German weekly magazine Der
Spiegel, first published a story about the allegation last year. It said that in 2010, she reached
an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment
for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Ms Mayorga's lawyer said she had
been inspired to re-open the case by the #MeToo movement. Ronaldo has not denied that the
two met in Las Vegas in 2009, but said that what happened between them was
consensual. At the time, Ronaldo was playing
for Manchester United, and about to join Real Madrid, where he spent the next
nine years. Ronaldo moved to Juventus last
July. He has won the Ballon d'Or - awarded to the world's best footballer - in
2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017. -AFP
