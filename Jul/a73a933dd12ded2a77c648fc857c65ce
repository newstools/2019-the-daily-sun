SOUTH African-born Belinda Davids was honoured at the UK’s National Tribute Music Awards in Droitwich, England. Belinda, who was the star of hit show The Greatest Love of All: A Tribute to Whitney Houston, said: “As an artist, there’s nothing more rewarding than knowing you affect people in whatever way that is.” Belinda, originally from Port Elizabeth, has performed in a number of countries and has also won the BBC’s Even Better Than The Real Thing contest. Belinda will be performing at the Artscape Theatre Centre in Cape Town from 20 November. “This will be the only concert I perform in South Africa this year. I’m looking forward to working with a live orchestra for the first time in South Africa,” she said. “We are working on an amazing performance.” She’ll also appear at Joburg’s Civic Theatre in June next year.
