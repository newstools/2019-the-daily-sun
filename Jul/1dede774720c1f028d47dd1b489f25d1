SINGER Xoli Nosenga said it’s time to start apologising to people with albinism. Last week, he donated sunscreen to pupils with albinism at Manzini Primary School in Sebokeng, in the Vaal, for Mandela Day. He said this was his way of starting a campaign to assure people with the condition are protected. “They should be treated with respect because it’s their basic human right. We have to start participating in keeping them safe and realise they are human just like everybody else,” he said. “We even call them inkawu, which means monkey, but we fight when we are called names by other people and races. Our silence has been loud and that is why this problem continues to happen. But it ends with me. We are tired of cruel people who claim their skin cures diseases and can be used for muthi.” Last year, Xoli released a book called My Skin is Not a Cure, which was inspired by the bad treatment people with albinism received in past decades. In his book, Xoli writes that the world is sick for thinking people with albinism make good muthi.
