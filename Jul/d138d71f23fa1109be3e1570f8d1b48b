RELATIVES of a murdered teenager want her killers to rot in jail. Sinegugu Dlamini (13) was found dead next to a river near Jika Joe squatter camp in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday. A resident was electrocuted while chasing a suspect believed to have been involved in the girl’s murder. A relative (32) told Daily Sun Sinegugu didn’t come home on Sunday afternoon and residents started searching for her. “She often went to play around the area and would come home in the afternoon,” she said. The relative said they approached cops on Monday morning after looking everywhere for Sinegugu. Residents continued searching and found the body the next day near a shack belonging to two men who’d arrived in the area two months before. “Residents suspected the two men could be behind the death of the girl. They stormed their shack,” she said. “The two men ran away but residents chased them. During the chase, one of the men pushed a resident onto exposed wires, which electrocuted him.” The relative said they caught one man and the other was still at large. “I hope the other suspect is found and put behind bars,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a missing person’s docket was opened on Sunday. “A resident believed to be in his 40s was electrocuted and declared dead on the scene. “A suspect in his 20s was arrested. Cops are investigating a murder case and an inquest docket was opened.”
