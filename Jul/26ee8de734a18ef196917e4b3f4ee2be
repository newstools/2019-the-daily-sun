THE Nyanga cop shop in Cape Town is intensifying its efforts to decrease crime in the area. On Saturday  last week the police station brought men together to encourage them to play a positive and responsible role in society. “We invited men to help find a solution,” station commander Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha said. He said men were both perpetrators and victims of crime. “We always ask ourselves where we went wrong and why men are always the ones doing bad things. “Besides arresting them, we had to come up with another plan. We hope this dialogue will help. “We’re not doing this because we’re tired of arresting them but because we want to make our communities safe.” Nyanga CPF’s Buyisile Makhasi urged men to attend such talks. “We’re aware some men are victims. That’s why we want to talk as men about how to fight this. We can’t just depend on the police to arrest those who commit crime,” said Makhasi. “We have to do our bit to make sure those who aren’t involved in bad things don’t do them.” Lesego Raphalane said the Human Rights Commission joined the dialogue because it wanted to be part of change.
