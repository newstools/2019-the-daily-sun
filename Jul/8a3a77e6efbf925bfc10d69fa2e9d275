THERE was no teaching or learning at Hlelingomusa Primary School on Monday. This came after parents in Imbali unit 15, Pietermaritzburg, kept their kids home and locked the school gate. They demanded that the education department fire the principal. Among the things they were unhappy about were poor marks, interference with the nutrition programme and infighting among teachers. A 37-year-old parent said: “Our kids tell us they’re not being taught and we’ve discovered the principal has caused divisions.” Another parent (33) wanted the department to intervene. A teacher said some staff members were badmouthed after asking questions about how the school was being managed. “The hated teachers are given 80% of the work, while the favourites are given 20%,” said the teacher. “This results in teachers who’re overworked resisting work and the academic programme suffers as a result.” SGB chairman Mabhungu Mkhize told the People’s Paper the complaints were valid, and he urged the education department to intervene. Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they were made aware of the situation at Hlelingomusa Primary School. “But we’re appealing to the parents not to correct wrong by doing wrong,” Mahlambi said. “Closing the school is not right. This affects the education of their kids. “We urge them that when they have issues they feel are being ignored, they should raise them directly with the department.”
