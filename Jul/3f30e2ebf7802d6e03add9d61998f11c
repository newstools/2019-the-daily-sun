KZN’s human settlements department is flooded every day with calls from people wanting RDPs. But not all beneficiaries are doing the right thing. Department spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said he was shocked to see a Facebook post on Tuesday from a man advertising his RDP for R65 000. He said it showed a lack of gratitude. “Selling the house for this amount is literally showing the middle finger to government’s efforts to provide shelter to the poorest people in the country. “Currently, to build an RDP house costs the department R116 000 a unit.” Baloyi said they knew the house was in ward 2 of Sweetwaters in the Msunduzi Municipality. “And he said he’d seen similar posts from other people. “People need to know selling an RDP house is against the law. “When we provide houses, we want people to have shelter. “If a person doesn’t need the house anymore, they need to call us and give back the title deeds, so it can be given to someone who needs it more than them.” Baloyi said people in cities and kasis needed to stay in their RDPs for at least seven years before they could pass them on to anyone else. “The challenge we have with people in rural areas is most of the time, the land on which the houses are built falls under traditional authorities and we don’t have control over it.” Baloyi said the department was following up on the posts and had the right to take back the houses if beneficiaries were found to be breaking the law.
