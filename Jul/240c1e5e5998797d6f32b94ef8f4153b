RESIDENTS of Better Life in Gugulethu, Cape Town, were shocked when they found a newborn baby dumped in a communal toilet on Friday morning. The body was found by kids who wanted to use the toilet. Resident Lindiwe Faku (44) said: “Cops must arrest the person who dumped this baby. “The incident has traumatised our kids because they saw blood and a dead baby.” Another resident, Siyasanga Majola (37), said he believed whoever dumped the baby was from another kasi. “Nobody from our area would do this because obviously people would have seen who was pregnant. “Dumping a baby in the same area would have raised suspicions,” he told Daily Sun. “We will help the police get to the bottom of this matter.” Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said cops were investigating the incident. “An inquest case was registered after community members found a dead baby in the toilet. “Anyone with information about the incident should call Gugulethu cops or 08600 10111,” he told the People’s Paper.
