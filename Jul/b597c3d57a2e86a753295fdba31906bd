THE residents are being terrorised by an electric pole! Residents of Soweto-on-Sea, Nelson Mandela Bay, said the electric pole had been hanging over their houses for weeks. And while the wild wind the area is famous for keeps blowing hard, the residents believe tragedy can strike at any time if the pole on Mqwashu Street is not fixed soon. Phindiwe Billy (46) told Daily Sun there was strong wind and rain on 6 April. “The blew the pole around. We reported it immediately to the municipality and the ward councillor. Municipal workers came later on the same day and promised to come back,” she said. “But we haven’t seen them since. They never came to fix it. “It is a ticking time bomb. We are worried about the safety of our kids and our houses.” Her neighbour Monwabisi Nkone (47), said: “We don’t know what else we need to do for the municipality to fix the pole. “I’ve switched off my fridge because I’m scared. When this pole falls down it is going to cause a lot of damage,” she said. “We are living in fear of being killed by this pole.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Residents should report the pole at 0800 2050 50 and get a reference number. As soon as they provide us with it we can investigate what happened.”
