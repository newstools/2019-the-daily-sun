THREE people travelling in a white Toyota Etios were yesterday gunned down in an incident apparently linked to taxi violence. Two died at the scene and the third in hospital. The incident took place in Protea Glen at about 10am. The three had pulled over on the side of the road. Captain Kay Makhubele said a BMW pulled over next to them. “Information received is that one of the occupants of the Toyota got out to take a school bag from the BMW driver,” he said. After the BMW driver drove off, a Mazda bakkie with three occupants stopped next to the Toyota. “Two occupants of the Mazda got out and started firing several shots at the people in the Toyota before driving off. Two of them, aged 35 and 40, died instantly.” The motive for the attack was unknown. “No arrests have been made yet,” Makhubele said. He urged anyone with information to come forward.
