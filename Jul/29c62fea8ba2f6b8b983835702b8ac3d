FOR PEOPLE living with albinism health is as important as anyone else. A unique intervention has been locally designed to promote other initiatives that advance the rights of people living with albinism through the Family and Community Restoration programme. The programme was introduced by Khulisa Social Solutions, an NGO that aims to strengthen the fight against stigmatisation of the condition through public education. The programme serves as a vehicle for justice to redress discrimination and ill-informed practices against people living with albinism. It also aims to promote dialogue to resolve and transform conflict and make peace between families and communities. To date, the process is working well and has already been introduced in countries like Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Malawi, among others. The findings of the preliminary cases will be announced in early November at the Pan-African conference to be hosted by the department of justice, in partnership with Khulisa and other key participants, to celebrate 16 Days of Non-Violence and International Restorative Justice Week. At Khulisaâ€™s recent workshop and feedback session, people witnessed how progress could be achieved, through effective dialogue and restorative practices, in one of the most stigmatised sectors of our society.
