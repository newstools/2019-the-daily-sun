FUNERALS often become a show-off event for boastful relatives, and a burial that should cost no more than R20 000 can end up costing up to R300 000! Funeral Industry Reformed Association spokesman Johan Rousseau said: “If a neighbour had this and that, the other neighbour wants to beat that. It’s insane. People need to be educated.” He said funeral parlours were creating unnecessary competition. “They sell a casket for R20 000 and people buy into that. This is daylight robbery and people fall for it.” Cultural expect Mtimande Ngwenya said there’s no need to spend so much on a funeral. “The funeral is about the dead person’s dignified send-off. There’s no need for fancy food and cars and hearses,” he said. “Some people buy fancy clothes to show off at the funeral. Are they going to a funeral or a fashion show?” He said this was all wrong. “People need to go back to their roots where a person dies and the mourners and the family get together the next day to bury the family member,” he said. Manqoba Mbatha of Mbatha Funeral Parlour told Daily Sun he didn’t blame families for wanting proper burials for their loved ones. “If that’s what they want and they can afford it, then they must do it. The problem is when people get into debt trying to impress people. If you don’t have money don’t fall into a debt trap for someone who’s not coming back,” he said. Gogo Thandi Malekela (62) said: “Usually, we wait for the family that comes from far away. We delay the funeral for one uncle who’ll contribute nothing towards the cost of the funeral.” Thandi said: “You’ve just lost someone and at the same time you have to feed all those people. We really have to change this thinking.” Gogo Anne Seemela (64) said: “I don’t want my children to be frustrated by people who’ll give them orders but do nothing to help. “If there’s insurance money to be claimed, they can do it after my burial. I have a will for this.”
