EVERY TIME Johannah Sekopane (27) goes to the local clinic she is told her file is missing. Johannah claims that every time nurses tell her to open a new file and now she is worried about her medical record, since she is taking medication after an operation. Johannah said the clinic nurses ended up telling her not to come back anymore. The woman from Almansdrift, near Vaalbank, said she could no longer take any medication and had to endure the excruciating pain in her womb caused by an operation in 2014. Her mother Lobisa Sekopane (62) said she had to use her pension grant to buy her daughter painkillers. “In the house I have to feed 11 people and buy pills for my daughter. She can’t work anymore because of the operation. No one is working and we survive on my grant. The clinic just chases her away,” she said. Johannah said she had the operation when she gave birth to her first child. “The operation at Mmametlhake Hospital was botched and doctors there failed to close the wound. I got help in hospital with the help of Daily Sun. “It dawned on me that I don’t have a medical record. The nurses at the clinic ended up telling me not to come back again. I couldn’t endure the pain and could not sleep at night because of it,” she said. Department of Health spokesman Dumsani Malamule said the complaint was traced and the patient was treated at the clinic. He said an appointment was made for Johannah to see a doctor.
