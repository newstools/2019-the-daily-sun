WHEN their four-month baby died after allegedly inhaling teargas during a protest, the family did not know how they were going to bury her. No one in the Mncedane family, from the Marikana squatter camp in Cape Town, works. They all depend on social grants to survive. Alunamda died after cops allegedly fired teargas into a group of protesters. Daily Sun published the story on 1 July under the headline: “Teargas killed my baby,” in which the family pleaded for help. Thanks to the People’s Paper, Fihla Funeral Services heard their cry. Baby Alunamda was buried last week. The funeral home’s CEO, Nozipho Fihla, said they knew they had to do something after reading the story. “We always reach out to those in need. We did the same a few months ago when we helped a family that lost three members in a shack fire,” said Fihla. “We are where we are because of the community. Helping is our way of thanking them for always supporting us.” Family member Nomzamo Mncedane said the family would be forever grateful to those who made sure Alunamda was buried. “We thank Daily Sun for publishing the story and Fihla Funeral Services for availing themselves because we didn’t know how we would bury her.” She also thanked the Marikana community for helping the family through this difficult time.
