HISTORY will be made in the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games (MAP) on Sunday as the curtain goes down and the new champions are crowned. As is always the case, hordes of football fans will gather at the Rotary Grounds to witness the last piece of action, making for an atmosphere that is unmatched at this level. Tomorrow, four teams who have never won this competition, will battle it out in the second leg of the semi-finals. Lebash will lock horns with D-10 in the first game at 1pm. The second match will see Baroka FC tackle Mamba 11 at 3pm. In the first leg of the semi-finals, both matches ended with a 1-1 scoreline, which will make things more interesting in the second leg. Overall winners of the two-legged fixture will face each other in the final of the tournament at Alexandra Grounds on Sunday (5pm). The players know what is at stake as the champions will pocket R190 000 and a new kit, while runners’ up will get a consolation price of R105 000 plus a kit as well. The team that finish in third place will get R35 000. Mambas’ dribbling wizard Tshepo “Skhwama” Matete said they know what to expect. “Baroka have young energetic players who train on a daily basis and us (Mamba), we only meet on match day and do our thing. But our experience is always key,” Matete said. Last year Mamba made their debut in the tournament and they crashed out in the last-16. “We are relying on experience. Our team might be barely two years old, but most of our players have been playing in the Map Games. That will give us an edge on the day,” Matete said. Matete, who is known for entertaining fans with his skills, said entertainment will be galore for football fans. “I have grown now. I don’t do those things (dribbling) anymore. But we have a lot of young players in the team who do those things, and they won’t disappoint on the day.” Over the years, the Map Games have grown in popularity, with fans travelling from around the country to come and watch the tournament.
