GONE are the days of battling relegation. Baroka FC will be gunning for the R15 million Absa Premiership prize cheque in the new season. The latest prize increases have been roundly welcomed by PSL clubs, and Baroka boss, Khurishi Mphahlele, reckons there can be no better motivation for his team to clinch a maiden league championship than that. “We are going for the title. Undoubtedly, that’s the goal in the new season,” said Mphahlele. “Plans are already underway and the team will be going for camps outside the province to prepare thoroughly. Of course, the league is no easy target. “But what would be the point of competing if we are not aiming for the title? Bakgaga attained their highest success when they edged illustrious Orlando Pirates to lift the Telkom Knockout Cup. But given their regular troubles with relegation, it all sounds like a lofty goal for Mphahlele. In their maiden PSL season, three years ago, the Limpopo side fought in the relegation play-offs to regain their top-flight status, having finished 15th in the Premiership. They staved off relegation the following year as they ended in 14th spot, and were no better last season when they escaped through the skin of their teeth. Yet, Mphahlele has refused to let the past determine the future. To that end, the club have already made five signings, recruiting Malawian Gerald Phiri Jnr and Manuel Kambala, Kamohelo Mogashwa, Sibonelo Ngubane, Manuel Kambala, Richard Mbulu and Mfanafuthi Shozi. They are not yet done in the transfers, and Mphahlele has confirmed they will be announcing two more players in the next few days. Some of the players may well come from the Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) Games – the popular tournament underway in Alexandra. Like other PSL team scouts, Mphahlele has been keeping a keen eye on the talent flowing in the annual tournament. The six-week tourney, featuring the juniors, seniors and masters, runs until 21 July.
