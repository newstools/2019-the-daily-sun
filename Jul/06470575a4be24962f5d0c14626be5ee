THE trouble began after Siyabonga Zondi’s cows strayed into his uncle’s garden and damaged his plants on Monday. The 30-year-old said his uncle (57), beat him as his garden was damaged. Siyabonga, from Bubende Village in Swayimane, in the KZN Midlands, said the uncle’s house was only a few metres away from the grazing area. He said he was herding and left the cows in the usual place and went home as he always did. “I wasn’t aware the cows had damaged his garden until later on when he sent his son to call me. My uncle started beating me with fists. “He said I was disrespecting him. He beat me until my left eye was closed and he kicked me and broke some of my ribs.” Siyabonga opened a case against his uncle on Tuesday. “He was arrested on Saturday. I want him to be locked away as he has not come to ask for forgiveness,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault was opened at Wartburg Police Station. The suspect appeared in the New Hanover Magistrates Court on Monday and was released on free bail. The case was postponed to 7 August.
