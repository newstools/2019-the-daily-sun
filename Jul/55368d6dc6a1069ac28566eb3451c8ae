Hey MizzB I’M a 26-year-old married woman who grew with abuse and now  my husband is very abusive towards me and my kids. My 10-year-old daughter, who I had before my marriage, told me my husband tried to rape her. I cannot go back home as both families say no successful marriage is without its secrets. I fear for my daughter but  my husband is a respected church leader.  What must I do? ) Mum Hey Mum Children who are witnesses or victims of domestic violence end up with mental and physical problems, leaving them vulnerable to becoming violent or having toxic relationships. It is sad that you have poor support from your families but staying in an unhealthy relationship risks your kids’ lives. Report abuse and get professional help. Turn your wounds into wisdom by breaking the cycle of abuse for your children.
