COPS and Metro police have been raiding schools in Ekurhuleni kasis since last week. Metro cops spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago  said the raids were expected to continue this week. Kgasago said school safety remained a challenge. Dagga, condoms and scissors were among the items that were confiscated. “Some pupils carry dangerous weapons to school while some use narcotics and get high before classes even commence,” he told the People’s Paper. Kgasago said Metro cops regularly conducted searches at problematic schools, where  s chool bags and toilets were searched. When the combined team raided Bokamoso Secondary School in Tembisa on Friday, dagga was found on the pupils. “At Rhodesfield Secondary School in Kempton Park last Tuesday, police found dagga pips, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, matches, lighters, condoms and a pair of scissors,” Kgasago told the People’s Paper. All the confiscated items were sealed and booked in at the Kempton Park Police Station. Kgasago said no arrests were made.
