WHEN Phakamani Vazi went out to buy bread and sausages for his hungry girlfriend, he had no idea he would never see her again. While he was out at about 12.30am on Sunday morning, she burnt to death in a shack fire in Qandu Qandu squatter camp, Khayelitsha, Cape Town. The 31-year-old told Daily Sun his girlfriend started complaining that she was hungry at about 10pm. He said he was shocked when he returned to find his shack on fire. Phakamani said what was most shocking was that only his shack was affected. “I will miss her so much because we loved each other. I’m left alone and the way she died pains me.” Neighbour Nomalungisa Nkwakhwa (35) said the fire could have been started by a candle. “I think if it was caused by illegal connections, more houses would have been affected,” she said. Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Jermaine Carelse said they responded to a fire in Qandu Qandu early on Sunday morning. “Upon arrival, it was confirmed that one adult female had sustained fatal burn wounds,” he said. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the body of a 26-year-old woman was identified by the community. “The dead woman sustained burn wounds and an inquest case was opened for investigation,” she said.
