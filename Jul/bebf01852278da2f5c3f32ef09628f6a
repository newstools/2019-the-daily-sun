Being too nice is almost a crime these days because the world is filled with dishonest people. Learn to associate with people of good quality, for it is better to be alone than to be in bad company. Your worth is what you are and not what you have. The sad thing about betrayal is that it never comes from your enemies. Sometimes you need to give up on bad people. Not because you don’t care, but because they don’t. Contrary to popular belief people don’t change, but stick to their nature after they reveal their true colours. When I was growing up, I realised that people who claimed to be my real friends were actually not. They only needed my help so they could achieve their goals. It is better to have an enemy who slaps you in the face than a friend who stabs you in the back. Heilbron
