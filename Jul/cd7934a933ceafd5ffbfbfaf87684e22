THE people of Glen Marikana squatter camp, Ekurhuleni, have lost faith in the police. They told Daily Sun a number of incidents led them to believe that cops were not on their side. On Friday, 11-year-old Teboho Mathamela was shot with a rubber bullet, allegedly by police. His mum Nthabiseng (42) said she was on her way to work when she saw her son crying in someone else’s arms. “I was told they were playing soccer and I still don’t understand how cops randomly shot at kids,” she said. Lucy Mamaru (27) said she was playing snooker when the police allegedly started assaulting her. “I kept asking why they were beating me, but all they did was laugh and said I talked too much,” she said. Jeffrey Malerothu (37) claimed he was searched and when he asked for the search warrant, cops assaulted him. “I was shocked because the cops are supposed to protect us, not assault people,” he said. Kenneth Thoka (33) and Thabang Ntsoane (32) claimed they were beaten and sprayed with pepper spray. Maria Khoza (43) said last Saturday, cops allegedly crashed into her shack and refused to take responsibility. Kempton Park police spokesman Captain Jethro Mtshali said they had not received any reports of an injured 11-year-old boy. “We can confirm that on Friday police were in Glen Marikana squatter camp tracing suspects in assault cases. It’s alleged the police were pelted with stones and bottles. “They fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. “We also want to state that last week, police were conducting a normal crime prevention operation in the same area and two police vehicles and three private security vehicles were damaged,” he said. He advised anyone who wanted to report wrongdoing to approach station commander Brigadier Samuel Maredi.
