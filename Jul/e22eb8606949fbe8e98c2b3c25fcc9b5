BISHOP Zwelakhe Mzimela’s grave is right at the gate of the church, and not everyone is happy with the arrangement. There’s a school and creche on the premises, so parents are worried. Parents of pupils at Bonginkosi Christian Academy and Pre-School in KwaMashu, north of Durban, said their kids aren’t allowed near a grave. “But now they’re being forced to be at a school that has a grave,” said a parent. She said the church should have dug the grave at the back of the church, where it would have been out of sight. Another parent said: “I wish to take my child to another school.” A worker said if he wanted to work at a graveyard he’d have applied for a job there. Other parents said the grave didn’t bother them. “Kids won’t have a problem unless someone tells them there is one,” said a parent. Mzimela died from kidney failure and was buried on Saturday. KZN Traditional Healers Association chair Thandonjani Hlongwane said: “The parents should find an inyanga who’ll guide them on what they should do to protect their kids from being affected.” Church spokesman Pastor Mthetheleli Zulu said: “We appeal that they come to us so we can explain why this was done.” Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said a cemeteries and crematoria by-law permits anyone to be buried anywhere. “So the church applied and it was approved.” Mayisela said if approved a grave can be dug anywhere the person wishes.
