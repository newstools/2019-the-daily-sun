TWO local stars inspired DJ Weather to follow his passion for music. The house musician, whose real name is Selaelo Moseamo (22), is from Mohodi in Limpopo. He told SunBuzz Shimza and Black Coffee’s hard work and determination motivated him. He has listened to their music since he was 13. He said they were the reason he was making music right now and their music kept him going when he was feeling low. DJ Weather told SunBuzz: “They are dedicated to their work and they help people reach for their dreams.” They even push their brands outside the country. “I produce and play only dance house and Afro house. “These genres are doing well in Mzansi. People love them and so do I.” The DJ, who started making music professionally in 2013, said he has learnt a lot from his mistakes and is now a master of his craft. When he is not busy in studio, he offers deejaying lessons and teaches young musicians how to produce their own music. DJ Weather said: “Around October, I am going to release a new single titled Don’t Stop with Chymamusique. “It is an Afro house song and fans are going to love it.” The DJ said playing his sets at the Durban July last weekend was one of the highlights of his career. “People loved it and were very happy. “I couldn’t stop smiling after the show on the way home,” he said. DJ Weather said he hoped one day to be able to work with his idols Shimza, Black Coffee, Da Capo, Mi Casa, Jim Mastershine and Vitoto.
