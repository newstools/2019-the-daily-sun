ALTHOUGH residents keep complaining about their chemical toilets, Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina denies tender corruption allegations. On Wednesday, Masina said chemical toilets in his municipality had increased from 9 000 to 39 000 in the past five years. He said R872 million was spent on them, dismissing an amaBhungane investigation that claimed there was tender fraud relating to the toilet projects. Last week, the investigative reporters said R1,9 billion had been spent on the toilets in the past two years. Residents of Madelakufa extension 2 squatter camp in Tembisa told the SunTeam yesterday they were gatvol. Mum of three Thabeth Mbo (41) said: “They stink. They get cleaned but are impossible to manage. Many of us share a single toilet. “I’m often at the hospital as my children suffer from flu and diarrhoea. There is sewage everywhere.” People said there were 530 chemical toilets, despite them being promised 1 000. Bertha Moyo (36) said the situation was a mess. Councillor Philip Thamahane said: “The toilets don’t give dignity to residents. It seems other people benefit from them.” DA shadow MEC for human settlements Kate Lorimer said an audit of how many toilets were delivered was needed. “We need an investigation. It’s time to get to the bottom of this as residents are suffering,” she said.
