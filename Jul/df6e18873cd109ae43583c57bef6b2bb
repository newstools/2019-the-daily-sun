WHEN he vowed to come back and burn down the housing transit camp, residents thought he was just making an empty threat, and ignored him. But the residents of the Ridgeview transit camp in Chesterville, Durban, found out in the early hours of yesterday morning that the jealous man hadn’t been joking when he returned, poured petrol on a block of shacks and set it alight. Five rooms in the block were burnt to ashes. Fisani Majola (44), who lost everything, said she wasn’t home when the man made the threats. “I was told he came looking for his baby mama, who came into the transit camp with a maskandi group member about two weeks ago for rehearsals,” she said. “I heard they stayed in the room of a male group member. When the baby daddy arrived, the owner of the house was there.” Fisani said when the man answered the door, holding the man’s baby in his arms, the angry father left in a huff, saying he would come back and finish everyone off. “We were woken up by fire burning. There was fire everywhere and all our belongings were destroyed,” she said. Daily Sun tried to get hold of the baby mama but her phone was on voice mail. The baby daddy’s phone rang unanswered. Sources told Daily Sun the baby mama was now back with her baby daddy as she probably feared he would go back to the transit camp and kill everyone. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed about five rooms were destroyed by fire at the transit camp. “The cause of the fire is not known. No injuries were reported and no case was opened,” said Gwala.
