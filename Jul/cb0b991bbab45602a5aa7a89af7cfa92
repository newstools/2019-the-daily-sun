A PANEL beater has angered a gogo by stripping her car! Gogo Maureen Mnguni (69) from Moeka in North West told Daily Sun she took her Ford Ranger to be fixed in 2015 after it was involved in a car accident. She said much of the damage was on the driver’s side. But instead of the car being fixed, it was stripped. She said the man took advantage of her as she was an elderly widow. “I want him to take the car and put back the right engine and wheels.” She said the panel beater had asked her to pay R22 050 to fix the car, and she paid a deposit of R12 000. “He told me my car would be fixed within two weeks but instead, stripped it and took my money.” But Thompson Sekwambane (60), the owner of Thompson Panel Beaters in Kanana, Hammanskraal, admitted to Daily Sun gogo Maureen’s car was supposed to be a cut and joint. He said he was about to buy the missing part needed to fix the car when he was diagnosed with diabetes. He said his family had taken him to Tzaneen, Limpopo, for treatment. “It took me almost two years to heal. My workers stripped the car while I was away and even stole my business material.” He said he’d asked the gogo to give him a chance to fix the car. “But she demanded her car back and I towed it back. “I’m still recovering and taking medication.” Thompson promised that he’d negotiate with gogo Maureen to pay her R4 000 every month as he didn’t have enough money yet.
