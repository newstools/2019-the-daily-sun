GOGO Mavis Madlala (70) said she was happy when former KZN premier Zweli Mkhize promised her a proper house in 2011. But eight years later, the gogo from Willowfontein, Pietermaritzburg, is still waiting. She said her situation became worse in 2017 when three of the five rooms of her mud house were damaged by heavy rain. “I now share the remaining two rooms with my daughter, son and three grandkids whose mum died a few years ago,” she said. “When it rains, water floods into the house and we fear the remaining rooms will collapse.” Mavis said she met Mkhize when he visited gogos in the area for Christmas in 2011. She said Mkhize later sent local leaders to give her a blanket, groceries and R1 000 food vouchers. But that was the last she heard from him. Councillor Thabiso Molefe said: “The matter was brought to my attention. I’m still following up on what happened.” Mkhize’s spokesman Popo Maja said the minister couldn’t remember the gogo. “But he has asked local leaders to visit the family and find out more,” he said.
