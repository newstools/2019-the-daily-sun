WHEN madala applied for an RDP house in 2012, he thought he would have onewhen a new housing project started in his area. But disabled Bonga Zuma (60) still lives in a mud house – seven years later. Bonga, from Sweetwaters inPietermaritzburg, told Daily Sun he was suffering. “Two years ago my roof was blown off in strong winds. The people I hired to fix it didn’t do a proper job,” said madala. He said he was left confused after residents who applied for houses at the same time received theirs two years ago. “I was left out. I don’t know why. I waited and kept hoping mine would be built. Months passed by but nothing happened,” he said. Bonga said he approached his ward councillor last year to inquire about the matter. The councillor allegedly took down his personal details and promised to check for him. “Whenever I go to his office for a follow-up, I am told he is out,” he said. He pleaded with the authorities to build him an RDP house. “My leg was amputated in 2013. I can’t work and my disability grant is not enough to cover all my basic needs. I can’t buy food with it and save towards building a better house.” Ward councillor Sbu Mtshali said: “The project is not yet finished and is still ongoing. “The madala is not the only one whose house is not yet built.”
