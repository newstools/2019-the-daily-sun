MANY up and coming businesses face the problems of access to funding when it’s time to expand. When these businesses reach a stage of expanding the business, they can be faced with the predicament of selling a stake in their company in exchange for capital. This brings into the picture venture capitalists. Venture capitalists are an investor that provides capital to businesses showing high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake. This could be funding start-up ventures or supporting small companies that wish to expand but do not have access to equities markets.  Venture capitalists are willing to risk investing in such companies because they can earn a massive return on their investments if these companies are a success. These investors experience high rates of failure due to the uncertainty that is involved with new and unproven companies. According to co-founder of Alumni Energy Investments Shakes Motsilili, most entrepreneurs get frustrated when venture capitalist expect financials from them as they are still starting out and don’t have a track record. “You need to be able to do forecasts, where you are able to analyse what you current market is and how much profit you expect to make,” Motsilili said.
