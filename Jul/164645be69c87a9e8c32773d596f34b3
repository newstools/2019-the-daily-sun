MAYOR Zandile Gumede’s supporters were arrested yesterday after protesting at Durban City Hall. Vowing to make Durban ungovernable until the mayor returns to work, they blocked Pixley kaSeme Street in the morning. Mzo Dube, their spokesman,was bust. One of their leaders, Ndumiso Nojiyeza, said they would not go home until the ANC allowed the mayor to return to work. “We came here to give her a hero’s welcome but were disappointed to learn she was prevented from coming to her office. “Let police kill us but we are not going to leave the city until they bring back our mayor,” Nojiyeza said. He lashed out at ANC provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli, who on Wednesday said Gumede would not be allowed back to work. He said Ntuli led a faction that didn’t want the mayor to retain her position as regional ANC chairwoman. Ntuli said on Wednesday that the mayor’s leave was extended for a month. Cops bust Independent Media journalist Sihle Mavuso for filming the arrest of the mayor’s supporters. They claim he assaulted a policeman during his arrest. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a man was bust for assaulting a cop, while seven were bust for public violence.
