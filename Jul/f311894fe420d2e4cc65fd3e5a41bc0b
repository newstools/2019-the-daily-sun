WARD 20 in Nelson Mandela Bay will hold a by-election soon. This is after the incumbent, Bongo Nombiba lost numerous appeals, including in the Constitutional Court, and handed himself over to prison officials. The ward, one of the dirtiest in the metro, is now without a councillor. Residents even dump uncollected refuse in front of the councillor’s office. Noxolo Speelman (43) lives opposite the office in KwaNdokwenza. She told Daily Sun residents were ready to elect a new councillor. “We want a new councillor who is not going to be biased. The new councillor must deal with numerous challenges. We have houses but no title deeds. “My new RDP house was sold and I now live on a property that isn’t registered in my name. We want water, toilets and electricity. We want to vote and want radical change,” she said. Madoda Mfengu (45), of KwaZakhele, said: “I don’t think people are ready for a by-election. We’ve just had national elections in May. Whoever wins will have to work hard.” Crosby Bacela, IEC chairman in Nelson Mandela Bay, said: “I’m not sure when the by-election will be held in Ward 20. We’re waiting for confirmation from the provincial legislature. “However, there are by-elections lined up for 18 September. But I can’t say an election in Ward 20 will be one of them.” Nombiba was found guilty of fraud and corruption in April 2017 and was sentenced to five years imprisonment. He appealed more than six times. He lost his Constitutional Court battle on 4 July and was ordered to hand himself over to prison officials last Monday.
