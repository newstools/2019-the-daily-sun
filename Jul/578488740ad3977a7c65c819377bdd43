SHE kissed her two sons goodnight and, as usual, went to sleep in another room. But the next morning when they didn’t come to greet her, Anna Makwakwa (30) went to investigate and found her sons dead. Her kids, aged five and 10, had died from inhaling smoke from a mbawula in the room in their house in Langaville, near KwaThema in Ekurhuleni. Police were called and paramedics certified them dead. Anna was admitted to hospital. She was crying as she told her story to the SunTeam. “We were trying to keep ourselves warm because we didn’t have an electric heater. “I’ve now lost my two kids because of an mbawula.” Anna from Maputo said she had a headache during the night and went to drink water. “I wish I had gone to check on my children. Perhaps I could have woken them up.” She said she regrets bringing them to Mzansi. “They were living with my mum, and last year I went to fetch them so they could be closer to me. “Now I’ll never see my kids again. I don’t know how I’m going to face life without them. “I don’t have money to give them a decent burial.” She appealed to SunReaders for help to bury her kids. Tsakane police spokeswoman Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu said an inquest docket was opened.
