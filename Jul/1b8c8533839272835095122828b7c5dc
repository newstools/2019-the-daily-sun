THE ANC has described the destroying of schools and other structures during protests as ‘barbaric acts’.The ruling party released a statement today following the torching of Katlehong Primary School in the east of Joburg apparently during a protest against lack of electricity.Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi early this morning tweeted photos of the damage and said his department would not fix the school. “We strongly condemn this destruction of a school, in the process destroying the future of the children, past and present. This senseless act of criminality must not go unpunished”, read the statement from Luthuli House. “Since 1994, the ANC government has been working tirelessly with communities to open the doors of learning and culture to all children, so that we secure our future. As communities, we should be determined never to allow criminals and anarchists to derail this progressive programme. “ “The ANC is confident that the law-enforcement agencies will leave no stone unturned in pursuing those responsible and ensuring that they face the full might of the criminal justice system.” “We urge members of the community to join hands with the police and provide whatever support or information that they might have to the police to enable them to bring those responsible to justice.” “We call on the law-enforcement agencies to continue adopting a zero tolerance approach against those who destroy public property. We must ensure that criminal elements in our midst have no place to hide”, ended the statement.
