RESIDENTS of Lower Crossroads were furious after they heard a woman was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend early on Tuesday morning. They woke up to the disturbing news that Buyiswa Matho (33) was found dead at her home in the Cape Town kasi. Buyiswa’s landlady, Nomaxhosa Mbethe, said she didn’t hear any fights between the victim and her 39-year-old boyfriend. “I lived with her for years and we never had a fight. She was a peace-loving woman. I used to see her boyfriend visiting her and they looked happy together,” she said. The boyfriend disappeared after the murder and Nomaxhosa found the body covered in a blanket after noticing Buyiswa’s door was open early in the morning. Neighbour and friend Nozipho Mlazi (25) said the boyfriend was jealous but she never thought he would turn to murder. “He had anger issues but I didn’t think it would lead to the death of my friend. As young women, it’s now hard to feel safe around our boyfriends,” she said. Police spokesman Siyabulela Malo confirmed the incident and said the boyfriend was the suspect. “A case of murder was registered after a 39-year-old man handed himself over to the police in Philippi East at around 12.45pm on Wednesday. He confessed to murdering a 33-year-old woman. The suspect was detained and is expected to make an appearance in the Athlone Magistrates Court soon.”
