FOUR of Polokwane’s municipal electricians were arrested for allegedly stealing electric cables. The three men and a woman have been linked to cable theft worth millions of rands. After investigating for a while, cops nabbed them on Friday. It seems the municipality suffers cable theft in the townships almost every two weeks, while one or two incidents are reported at substations every month. Municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said cable theft is a serious crime. “An internal investigation will be held and if there are findings against these employees, disciplinary processes will proceed. Cable theft affects services to the residents,” he said. Selala said the matter had been handed over to the police to investigate and residents are urged to keep watch over their service infrastructure and report any suspicious activity to the police. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspects were nabbed after being suspected of involvement in several cases of cable theft. These caused power cuts in and around Polokwane. “As investigations continue, more arrests may be made. Investigations will show if they are part of a syndicate.”
