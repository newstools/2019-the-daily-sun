MANY people believe bigger women are not fit and call them names on the street. But big mama Maatemeke Phasha is on a mission to give them back their confidence. The 37-year-old Miss Curvy 2018 is from Atteridgeville, Tshwane. She told Daily Sun that at the next April pageant in Bloemfontein, she wants to show women that no matter how big they are, they can still be beautiful. “I want to use my body to show other women with bodies like me to be proud of themselves and to inspire others,” she said. Maatemeke, who won Miss Face of Limpopo Plus Size this year, said she wanted to become an ambassador for clothing shops because bigger women often struggle to get clothes in their sizes. “To prove that nothing is wrong with my body, I show people I can run and dance and do most things better than skinny people.” Maatemeke said the plus size community loved what she was doing as they were not used to seeing bigger women wearing bikinis and short shorts. The married mum of a 15-year-old boy said in 2017 she weighed 120kg but has gone down to 98kg. “I follow a proper diet and do a lot of running to keep my body in good shape.” Maatemeke said she was fighting the exploitation of children and was a health ambassador who encouraged plus size women to live a healthy lifestyle.
