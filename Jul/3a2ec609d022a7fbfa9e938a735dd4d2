FOLLOWING his Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) debut, Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Ronwen Williams is sure to compete for the national teams’ number one jersey, Itumeleng Khune and Darren Keet must be warned. The future indeed looks bright for the 27-year-old SuperSport United keeper who proved his worth in Egypt where he made some telling saves , including from Mo Salah. But consistency will be key! He has received rave reviews about his sterling performances against Ivory Coast where he stood out higher than the rest when Bafana lost 1-0 loss to Ivory Coast in their Afcon opener match. In the last 16, when Bafana outclassed the host Egypt and eliminated from the tournament, Williams played a crucial role to deny Mohamed Salah and Mahmoud “Trezeguet” Hassan from scoring. “I always believed in myself,” he told SunSport. “I knew that I can perform well at an international level. I’m proud of myself. We did well as a team, no one expected us to reach the quarter-finals. We are proud of ourselves and this team can achieve a lot if given a chance. The game against Egypt was one of our best performance where we did not concede against Salah, who was the tournament’s superstar.” However, the quarter-final match against Nigeria’s Super Eagles nearly overshadowed Williams’ great displays when Bafana lost 2-1. Williams conceded a soft goal in the dying minutes of the match which saw Nigeria proceed to the semi-finals, where they last night played against Algeria. He stated: “That was a bad way to concede, and to go out in that manner is bad. But we are proud as a team with all the performances. From my side, this is a learning curve. I must not let this get me down. I must stay positive and reach for the stars. “There are a lot of positives that we can take out of this tournament. There are a lot of negatives as well. We know that in the first few games we didn’t play to the best of our abilities.”
