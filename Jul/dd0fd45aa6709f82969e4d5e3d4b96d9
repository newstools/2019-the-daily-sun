A SCHOOL has decided to allow boys to wear skirts and girls to wear trousers to make them feel free of judgement. St Brigid’s National School in Dublin, Ireland also took down signs showing whether toilets were for boys or girls. They said they changed their policy after realising some kids were questioning their gender. Local gay rights movement Me1st said: “Schools in Mzansi should adopt similar policies to encourage kids not to discriminate. The school has done a good thing because children need to be allowed to be who they are.” SunReaders also had their say:
