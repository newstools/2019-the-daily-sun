FIKILE is not only beautiful but has a golden heart! She will compete in the Mrs Africa Pageant on 2 August in Rustenburg. Fikile Mondlane (38) from Nkomazi in Mpumalanga said she believed the crown didn’t define her, but she defined it. She said she didn’t think she would go all the way to the finals when she joined the pageant. “I was overwhelmed when they announced the finalists. It felt fulfilling to have my name as one of the continental beauty pageant finalists,” said Fikile. She said the competition was not about being famous but making a difference in people’s lives. “It makes me happy to see other people smiling and going to bed happy,” she said. Fikile said being a Mrs Africa finalist was more about self-discovery. “Beauty is not about standing in front of a camera, taking pictures and showing them to the world. It is about bringing hope to the hopeless and loving everyone,” she said. She said she adopted an orphanage called Uthandiwe Children’s Home based in Malelane. “Children need love and attention. I go to the home to give children love, talk to them, ask them how they are doing and what they need,” she said. Fikile said she loved doing charity work. “I focus mainly on underprivileged communities. I go to schools, identify disadvantaged children with the teachers’ help and donate school uniform,” she said. She said she is also the founder of Grass to Grace Foundation, an organisation aimed at creating awareness on mental health. She has also worked as an immigrations officer for the Department of Home Affairs for 13 years.
