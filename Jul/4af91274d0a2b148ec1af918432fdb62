THANDOKAZI Mankayi has been in pain since she was bitten by a pit bull last Tuesday. The 32-year-old from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, told Daily Sun: “I can’t sleep because of the pain. “And the painkillers I got from the local clinic are not helping me at all.” Thandokazi said she was standing outside a gate when the dog attacked her. She claimed the dog owners offered her R30 to get medical treatment. She said she was later slapped by a member of the family that owns the dog, and told to stop telling people their pit bull bit her. “I was surprised when the boy slapped me, telling me to stop spreading lies about their dog. “Luckily, cops listened to me and the dog was taken away,” she said. “I want justice for my injuries, and the person who slapped me must be arrested.” Municipal law enforcement inspector Wayne Dyason said the dog was taken away, and a docket was opened. When asked whether the owners would get their dog back, he said: “That will depend on the circumstances, but public safety is the primary concern. “The details of the violence and how bad the injuries were will be taken into consideration,” Dyason told the People’s Paper.
