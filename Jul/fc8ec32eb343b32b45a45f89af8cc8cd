EASTERN Cape Health has called on people to protect ambulance employees after a gunman threatened workers in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth on Thursday night. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: “The workers were attending a call at Ngoma Street in Motherwell just after 9pm, when a gunman approached them. “When the driver sped away, a patient in the ambulance fell from a stretcher and injured her leg. The two ambulance workers escaped unharmed.” Kupelo said the threat against their workers seemed to be continuing non-stop. “Similar cases have been reported in other parts of the province. We condemn such crime in the strongest possible terms. “We call on residents to stop threatening ambulance workers and instead, protect them from thugs in their areas,” he said. He said they reported the matter to the police and called on them to leave no stone unturned when investigating the matter. “The law must now take its course and bring the person behind this crime to book.” Police spokesman Captain Andrew Beetge said that a case of pointing a firearm is under investigation but no arrests have been made yet.
