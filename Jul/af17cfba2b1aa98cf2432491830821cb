REAL Madrid are set to offload Gareth Bale in the current transfer window, head coach Zinedine Zidane has confirmed. The Welsh star was left out of the La Liga giants’ squad for their pre-season friendly against Bayern Munich on Saturday – which they lost 3-1. "He wasn't included in the squad because the club is working on his departure and that's why he didn't play," Zidane said. "We'll have to see what happens in the coming days.” Madrid, who have completed most of their acquisitions earlier in the window, now appear to be turning their attention on making space in the squad by clearing out a few players. Top of their list of players they want out the door, it appears, is Bale. The 30-year-old, however, could prove difficult to offload because of his age, injury record as well as his huge wages. Nevertheless, Zidane has made it clear that Bale will not be part of his plans this season and it would be ideal for both parties to part ways. "We'll have to see if it goes through tomorrow, if it does then all the better. Let's hope, for everyone's sake, that it happens soon,” Zidane added. "It's nothing personal. There comes a time when things are done because they need to be done. I've not got anything against him. We have to make decisions and change things, that's all there is to it. "I don't know if this will happen in 24 or 48 hours' time. The situation will change and it's for the best for everyone."
