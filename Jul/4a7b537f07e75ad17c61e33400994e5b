NYIKO Mobbie is sitting at home and frustrated! According to SunSport insiders, Mobbie may not realise his dream of playing for Mamelodi Sundowns this coming season. The former Free State Stars defender, who has signed for Sundowns, was not unveiled by the club when they announced their new Paraguayan striker Mauricio Affonso last week. Affonso is in camp with the Brazilians and Mobbie was conspicuous by his absence at the club’s off-season training camp in Nelspruit. Sundowns played friendly matches with National First Division side TS Sporting. “The management of Sundowns are divided with regards to Mobbie. As we speak, he’s stuck at home,” said an insider. “When they unveiled Affonso, why didn’t didn’t unveil him too? Why? “This is very sad because he’s just sitting at home while Sundowns are training. It was going to be better if he joined Bidvest Wits or Orlando Pirates because the two clubs wanted him.” When SunSport contacted Mobbie, he said he couldn’t talk. His agent, Mike Makaab, told SunSport he had no idea why Mobbie was not in pre-season camp with Sundowns, but said the player now belongs to the Brazilians. However, Sundowns official Yogesh Singh said Mobbie’s move is yet to be finalised. Said Singh: “We are involved in negotiations to sign Mobbie. “When everything is done, we’ll make an announcement.” Mobbie spent four seasons with Ea Lla Koto. However, the Bethlehem-based Stars were relegated last season, ironically losing to Sundowns in the last match of the season, with Pitso Mosimane’s charges confirmed the league champions. Mobbie was the mainstay when Stars won their Nedbank Cup last year – their first trophy in the PSL era, and their first cup in 24 years. Mobbie was always expected to leave Stars, who have already lost no fewer than nine players.
