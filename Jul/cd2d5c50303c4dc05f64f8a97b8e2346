While Bafana Bafana and other Cosafa representatives huffed and puffed at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), Madagascar have been writing their little sweet success story in their first appearance in the continental showpiece. There is no doubt that the tiny Indian Ocean islanders have been flying the flag high for the southern African region in Egypt after they carved their own path to the last 16. Madagascar will next face the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday. Guided by little-known French coach Nicolas Dupuis, Madagascar finished the group stage unbeaten and progressed to the knockout stage as Group B winners in a pool that had Nigeria, Guinea and Burundi. This while other Cosafa affiliates - Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola were sent packing after the first round. “I was happy when I learned about the groups because we were playing good teams and we had a chance to prove ourselves. I am happy that we did,” commented Dupuis after their 2-0 win over Nigeria to seal their last 16 berth
