TWO weeks ago Gugulethu Hlatshwayo left home to give birth. And the 20-year-old from Zola, Soweto, was not seen again! Her mum Nono Hlatshwayo (53) said the last time she saw Gugulethu was when she asked for transport money to go to the hospital. She later received SMSes saying Gugulethu had given birth to a boy and needed a blanket. But she never said which hospital she was at. “We call her phone every day and it rings but no one answers. We don’t know whether she’s safe. We need help to find her,” Nono said. “After I got messages from her, I rushed to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital to see her but she wasn’t there. I couldn’t find her at Jabulani Hospital either.” Nono’s sister Eunice Hlatshwayo, who works for the health department, could find no record of her being admitted to any hospital. “We are really worried,” she said. They said Gugulethu never went to the clinic for check-ups and they were worried she was the victim of a gang targeting pregnant women in Soweto. Constable Dakalo Phemula said police were investigating a missing persons’ case.
