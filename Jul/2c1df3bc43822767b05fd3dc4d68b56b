COPS in Kimberley arrested five suspected copper thieves on Thursday. The suspects were bust in two separate incidents. Northern Cape police spokesman Captain Sergio Kock told Daily Sun: “On Thursday at about 7.15am, the public order police followed up on information about stolen copper. They arrested two suspects for possession of suspected stolen goods in the veld in Florianville.” Kock said when cops arrived at the scene, they found a group of people burning copper in the veld. They tried to flee but one man and a woman, both aged 33 years old, were bust. “The 217kg copper has an approximate value of R16 000,” he said. “Police pounced on the men while they were busy burning copper cables in Colville. The 78kg copper has an approximate street value of R5 100.” The suspects are expected to appear in the Kimberley Magistrates Court.
