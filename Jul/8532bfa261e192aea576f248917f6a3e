ANC veterans league in KZN is mourning the death of its member Amos Ndwalane. The news of Ndwalane's death was broken by the provincial veterans league secretary Terressa Mthembu on Friday. Ndwalane(69) lived in Lamontville south of Durban with his family. In a statement issued by Mthembu she described him as trusted freedom fighter who sacrisfied all he had to fight for the liberation of the black people. Mthembu said Ndwalane passed away on the weekend but the league was only able to issue a statement on yesterday(Friday). "He was part of the coterie of ANC members who never backed down during the difficult days when many freedom fighters were murdered, forced to exile and arrested," said Mthembu. Ndwalane missed the death penalty by seven days when he was released in prison after he was due to be hanged. He was saved by the unbanning of the ANC in 1990 and death penalty was abolished. He was part of the rent defiance campaignÂ  called Asinamali which was led by the late young activist Msizi Dube in the Durban townships to boycot rents in the state owned houses.His daughter Sibonisile Msimang said the family was devasted by the Ndwalane's death. She said her father died after long illness. She said there was no specific illness and said the age wasn't on he dad's side. She said he will be buried next week.
