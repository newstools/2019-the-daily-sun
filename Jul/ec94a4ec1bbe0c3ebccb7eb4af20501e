KHUTSONG residents on the West Rand are afraid their houses will sink. Three families have moved out of their homes because of sinkholes. Others feel it is just a matter of time before their houses fall into the sinkholes. Two houses have already fallen in and one has a big hole that keeps sinking in the front lawn. Areal Ntaopane (51) said his family had to move out of their home because the hole in the front of the gate was getting bigger and deeper. “The hole first appeared in 2017. It was a very small. We reported it and got help. It appeared again last year and they closed it. “It appeared again in May and it became deeper and deeper,” said Areal. He said they have to live with relatives because it is not safe, especially for his kids. Areal said the hole is getting bigger because the dirty water that flows into it causes the soil to erode. “When we left our house, some of our valuables were destroyed, while some were stolen. So we have to move everything as soon as we can,” he said. He said it really upsets them that they have to move from their homes and live with other people. “It is an inconvenience. We are burdening other people when we have our own homes,” he said. Merafong municipal spokesman Sammy Mosia said the matter was being investigated by the relevant department.
