The Feather Awards and Thami Dish Foundation have released an official statement regarding the recent comments made by Zodwa about gay people. The statement reads as follows: "We have noticed, with great concern, a growing number of public figures making irresponsible statements on various public platforms. The feather awards prides itself in celebrating allies and lgbti individuals that push the agenda of acceptance and tolerance toward the LGBTIQ+ movement on various platforms of influence. Also read: ZODWA WON'T POSE WITH SKOLOPAD! With that said, it is with great disappointment that the feathers awards confirms that Zodwa wabantu is hereby stripped off the award that was conferred to her as an ally who symbolized freedom of expression, and challenged the status quo that often oppresses the marginalized. We also welcome the suspension of radio personality Phat Joe, for his homophobic statements against the LGBTIQ+ community. These incidents are a sad reflection of how much work still needs to be done on educating society about understanding diversities and promoting tolerance within the spectrum of human sexuality. See: ZODWA WABANTU'S SHOW ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE As we continue with our LGBTIQ+ dialogues, we hope that these unfortunate incidents will serve as teachable moments for all of us, public figures and “ordinary people” alike. Thank You." Zodwa has been trending all week, with social media users petitioning for the socialite to be 'cancelled'. Zodwa is yet to respond to all the commotion that's currently surrounding her.
