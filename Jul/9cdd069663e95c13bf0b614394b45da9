JUNE was Men’s Health Month. But are men taking care of themselves? Dr Tokelo Ramakhula, a general practitioner at Esizayo Clinic in Cosmo City, Joburg said although some men visit clinics for regular check-ups, many still avoid healthcare centres. Dr Ramakhula said healthcare workers encourage men, among other things, to seek advice, test for conditions that put them at risk, get treatment, take medication and stick to appointments. June is also the month in which the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people are highlighted. They, too, have rights to access healthcare facilities where their needs are taken care of. “We’re here to help men and provide medication where necessary, guide them through dietary plans and exercise routines, including referring them to the right specialists should this be required.” The doctor said support is there and men shouldn’t feel left out. He told the People’s Paper: “At our clinic we operate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 8am to 4pm and on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 7am and 7pm.” He stressed the danger of obesity mainly in men. According to Dr Ramakhula, obesity is when a patient’s body mass index is 30kg or higher. Esizayo Clinic will be running a winter campaign from today to 30 September.
