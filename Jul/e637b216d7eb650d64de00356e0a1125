THABONG residents have been living for weeks with dirty water spraying from a burst sewerage pipe. People from the kasi outside Welkom in the Free State told Daily Sun the pipe on Nkoane Road started leaking after a new mall was opened. Thapelo Molebatsi (29) from Orange Grove kasi said it was unbearable when it was hot. “It’s better now that it’s winter. The pipe burst and sewage is flying everywhere. “We’re being forced to eat kak. Imagine passing by while laughing on your phone. Flying kak will get into your mouth.” Nthabiseng Mofokeng (48) had tried to get the municipality to fix the pipe. “They refused to come. I don’t know what their problem was, but this is not healthy for us. “We can’t even pass on the side of the road where the kak is flying. I hope they do something before it’s too late. We can’t afford to go to doctors.” Matjhabeng municipal spokesman Tshepo Davids said: “The infrastructure department assigned workers to the area. The work will be done and the pipe will be fixed. “It has been leaking for some days but I will see to it that it’s fixed.”
