THE uproar over senior ANC member Derek Hanekom working with the opposition to oust former president Jacob Zuma continued to rage yesterday, with calls for his sacking rumbling. So far the calls for his sacking are coming from Zuma allies. Even Zuma entered the fray, tweeting that he was not surprised and that Hanekom “is a known enemy agent”. Even though ANC secretary- general Ace Magashule called Hanekom fake and divisive, there was no indication from his statement issued in the dead of the night that he would be brought before the disciplinary committee. Magashule said Hanekom was a “wedge driver” who was on a mission to divide the party. “Indeed this charlatan is making his mark through his ownership of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. Hanekom does not have the capacity to form a new political party, but he has shown remarkable agility in his efforts to divide the ANC,” Magashule said in the hard-hitting statement. He said it was shocking that Hanekom would even admit meeting the EFF to plot Zuma’s exit when, as a national executive committee member, he had full access to air his views in NEC meetings. Hanekom twice in 2017 in the NEC meetings raised the issue of Zuma to step down. The ANC veterans have come out to call for the expulsion of Hanekom, saying Magashule and the party’s top six must suspend his membership based on his admission. “There is no need to investigate Hanekom’s conduct any further. He has himself through his own confession confirmed what he had done,” the veterans charged in a statement. Head of ANC presidency Sibongile Besani has reportedly said the office agreed with Magashule’s statement. “Our view of the SG’s statement is that it is similar to that of the presidency. We wouldn’t like to find members of the ANC plotting against leaders of the ANC with leaders of the opposition. That is uncalled for. It cannot be supported,” Besani is reported to have said.
