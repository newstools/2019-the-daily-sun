THE family of Asenathi Gani and his school’s SGB have blamed the provincial education department for his death. A branch from a gum tree fell on the 10-year-old and two classmates at Lusikisiki Village Primary School, Eastern Cape, on Monday. The other boys, Lindokuhle Dweba and Alindwe Nqubula, sustained minor injuries but Asenathi died in hospital. His mum Phatheka (29) from Nyuswa Village said her son wanted to be a pilot. “I don’t know how I will bury him because I’m unemployed. I’ve been left with a permanent scar that will never heal.” SGB chairwoman Nombonisa Sigcawu said they had long been begging the department to build a proper school. “Damage has been caused over the years by trees. We have been raising this issue since 2012.” Sigcawu said there were 25 trees on the school premises. “We would hire someone to cut them but the maintenance funds won’t cover it. Government must do something.” Education department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said 10 social workers were sent to the school to provide counselling to pupils and teachers. “This was meant to address the traumatic experience suffered by those who witnessed the incident. “MEC Fundile Gade sent his condolences to the family of the victim,” he said.
