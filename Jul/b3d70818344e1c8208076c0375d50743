Charges have been dropped against Mandla "Mampintsha" Maphumulo
in the assault case laid by his partner Bongekile "Babes Wodumo"
Simelane. Both Simelane and Maphumulo appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate's court
on Thursday, after having initially ditched a court appearance on Tuesday. "The matter was finalised in that the charge against Maphumulo was
withdrawn. This is because both parties adhered to the ADR [mediation] processs
they committed to," said NPA spokesperson Natasha Kara. A warrant of arrest was issued for the couple on Tuesday, after they
failed to appear in court. The court previously heard that both parties had agreed to intervention
from Famsa. The organisation provides counselling, education and training for
South Africans who want help with relationship issues. Maphumulo was previously granted R2 000 bail. He was arrested after a
video of him launching a physical attack on Simelane went viral. The court ordered him to have no contact with her. However, since his previous court appearance, Maphumulo released a video
on Instagram of a song called Khona Ingane Lay'Ndlini, in which it seemed that
the couple had reconciled. The video featured Simelane, alongside DJ Tira and
Campmaster. SOURCE: NEWS24
