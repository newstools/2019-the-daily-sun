The urgent
application between President Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Protector Busisiwe
Mkhwebane has been postponed in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. According
to eNCA, the application, which is aimed at suspending her remedial action
against him, was postponed as there was no judge available on Tuesday. The urgent
application is aimed at suspending her remedial action against him. The
remedial action relates to her report on a R500 000 donation which Gavin
Watson, the CEO of Bosasa (now African Global Operations) had made to
Ramaphosa's 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Mkhwebane
found that Ramaphosa deliberately misled Parliament about the donation and that
his actions were inconsistent with his office as deputy president at the time. She also
found that Ramaphosa breached the Executive Ethics Code by failing to disclose
financial interests accrued to him as a result of donations received for the
campaign, News24 earlier reported. The matter
will now be heard on Thursday. This comes
a day after the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ruled in favour of Public
Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and suspended her remedial action against
him, pending a review. Judge Sulet
Potterill ruled that Mkhwebane was not "entitled" to entertain
complaints that were older than two years and that her findings on the
so-called South African Revenue Services (SARS) "rogue unit" were
"flawed", City Press earlier reported. SOURCE:
