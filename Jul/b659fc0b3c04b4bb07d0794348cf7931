THE thought of an elderly man shoving his kak and pee down her daughter’s throat keeps her awake at night. The angry 55-year-old mother from Eshowe, northern KZN, whose daughter (24) survived an abusive relationship with her 54-year-old lover, wants the suspect to rot in jail. “I cry each time I think about what he did to my daughter,” she told Daily Sun. She said her daughter had kept the affair a secret. “We disapproved when we discovered he was an ex-convict who had been in jail for killing his girlfriend,” she said. She said he was a control freak, but her daughter never said anything about it. The elderly woman said last year the man insulted her over the phone after she told him her daughter wasn’t going back to him. The young woman later reported the man to the police. “That’s when we found out about the abuse and death threats,” said the mum. The victim’s sister said there were signs of abuse. “She started dating the suspect in 2014. In 2016 she started losing weight. “She had bruises all over her body. “She stopped bathing in front of me,” said the sister. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a man was expected to appear in the Eshowe Magistrates Court soon for rape and assault charges.
