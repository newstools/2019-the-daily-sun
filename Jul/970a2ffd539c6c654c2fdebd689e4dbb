It’s beautiful to see everyone celebrating Mandela Month by offering their 67 minutes to help and make a difference to someone’s life. I hope and pray that from today, we make a conscious decision to go beyond just 67 minutes. Let us make every day a Mandela Day. Madiba lived his life for others. He fought for us and helped make a difference to the lives of the poor. Let’s learn to help people every day, not only during this month. I promise to give beyond 67 minutes.
