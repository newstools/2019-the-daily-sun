WHEN residents realised a rondavel was on fire, they tried to put out the flames. They were happy they did. That is, until the family the rondavel belonged to realised two kids were missing. They frantically searched inside the rondavel in Sandlwana Village, Bergville, KZN Midlands. To their horror, they found the bodies of Slindokuhle (7) and Khulani (2) Sishange, burnt beyond recognition. Their grandmother Zesuliwe Hlophe (43) said the two kids had gone to their aunt’s house to play. “Their aunt’s house is a few metres away from their father’s house,” said Zesuliwe. “They usually went there to play with other children. “But there was no one at home when they got there. “We suspect they went in and burnt something that apparently started the fire.” She said the rondavel was used to store thatch and other building material. “Their bodies were found behind the door and they were holding each other,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket had been opened.
