Thulani "Tyson" Hlatshwayo, the Bidvest Wits and Bafana Bafana captain has been heavily linked with a move to Pirates in this transfer window and the Soweto giants are said to seriously considering to make a strong bid. Said Motale: “Joining Pirates will be good for Hlatshwayo. It is a big club and if he goes there and do well for himself, so many doors will be open and his life will change." “Bear in mind that Pirates is a people’s team…they play in the Caf Champions League. When you speak about Pirates on the continent, they know what you talking about.”Magents as Motale is known, spent three years with Pirates. He captained them when they lifted the Caf Champions League in 1995 before leaving in 1997. But because he played for the Buccaneers, many still remember him of what he did at the club. At the age of 52, these days Motale is an ambassador for the annual Carling Black Label Cup.
