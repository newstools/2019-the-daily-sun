NANGOZA Jebe Hall was packed yesterday as people from all walks of life gathered to pay tribute to actress Nomhle Nkonyeni. Her memorial service in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, was attended by politicians, actors, musicians and Nkonyeni’s friend John Kani. He said: “I’m here to pay tribute. I’m not here to cry. “She was one of the best actors the world has ever produced. Nomhle was talent itself. “We met in 1961 and Nomhle, Winston Ntshona and I became politicians of artwork. “Her passion, dedication and focus when she was working were incredible.” Eastern Cape legislature deputy chairman of committees Tony Duba said Nkonyeni had a generous spirit and shared her passion for the arts with youngsters.
