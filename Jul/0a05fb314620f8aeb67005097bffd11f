MPUMALANGA police boss Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma has urged cops to be cautious on the road, on or off duty. Zuma’s plea came after two more cops died on Saturday. The deaths brought the number of officers who’ve died on the road to six since the beginning of the year. Constable Portia Zwane and Mthokozisi Nkosi, both aged 27 and working at the Mahamba Port of Entry, were travelling from Amsterdam. They were just about to join the N17 when their vehicle was hit by a truck travelling from Ermelo in the direction of Oshoek. The bakkie they were travelling in landed in a nearby plantation. Zwane was the passenger and Nkosi the driver. Zwane died on the spot while Nkosi was taken to hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries. A case of culpable homicide was opened at Chrissismeer Police Station. Ndhlovu was travelling with his wife, two daughters and a relative when the accident happened. Sergeant Lucas Morena (44) died on 8 June when his bike collided with a truck on the N4 near Rolling Hills. Zuma said the deaths of their members had left a void in the hearts of their families, the police force and communities they served.
