CLUBLESS Daylon Claasen could find a new home in Cape Town City. The former Bafana Bafana and Bidvest Wits midfielder is training with Maritzburg United, having cut ties with Bidvest Wits. But the Citizens have also shown interest in him and are understood to be watching the situation closely, hoping to lure the midfielder to the Mother City. Maritzburg, however, have also confirmed Claasen was training with the Team of Choice, along with former Chippa United midfielder Thamsanqa Sangweni. They added that they were looking to finalise more signings this week so that the coach can prepare for the new season better. For the longest time, Claasen has been considered one of the most promising youngsters to have emerged from the country, and there were high expectations when he joined Ajax Amsterdam when he was 18. But two years later he joined Belgian side Lierse, had trials with English Premiership side Everton and subsequently signed with Polish side Lech Poznan, and later with German club 1860 Munich. But he returned home having neither made a mark nor fulfilled the potential, which earned him a Bafana debut aged 20. The 29-year-old Mendes was spotted at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt and will be turning out for Lidoda Duvha next season. Mendes played in all the qualifying matches and featured in three of Guinea’s matches at the Afcon. “Black Leopards welcome Jonas Asvendo Mendes. He comes with a lot of experience from Portugal and Guinea Bissau,” the club said. The Limpopo side are on spending spree, splashing the cash in the transfers as they looked to challenge strongly for honours next season. Elsewhere, former nomadic Marc van Heerden has joined new kids on the block Stellenbosch FC from AmaZulu. The left-back becomes the eighth recruit for the Stellies.
