WHEN Thulani left his home, his family did not know it was the last time they saw him. Thulani Sibiya (26) from Lindelani, north of Durban, was shot dead on Saturday outside the home of a relative in Richmond Farm, not far from his home. His uncle Bonguyise Mhlongo (49) said: “When he left home he went to visit his relatives and was not planning on being away long. “But when he got there, he found there was a traditional ceremony and stayed longer,” said Mhlongo. He said they were told that a few minutes before the shooting, Thulani was talking to relatives inside the house. A woman came into the house and asked him to go outside with her to the gate. “We heard that while he was standing outside, people came and shot him. He died instantly,” said Mhlongo. He said they were not told who the woman was, where she came from, and what she wanted from Thulani. Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “On Saturday at 11pm, a man was found dead with a gunshot wound on the face along Khoza Road at Richmond Farm. A case of murder was opened at Ntuzuma cop shop.”
