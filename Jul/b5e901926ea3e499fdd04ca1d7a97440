THE process of identifying the bodies of nine young people killed in a horrific accident on Friday will start today. Eight of the dead were burnt beyond recognition after a taxi and a truck collided head on between Hendrina and Middelburg in Mpumalanga. The dead were interns who had just attended an induction at a nearby mine. Mpumalanga community safety spokesman Moeti Mmusi said they were waiting for the names of the dead to be released for the bodies to be identified. He said experts, working together with Road Traffic Management Corporation officials, were conducting the investigation. “The taxi was transporting nine interns from an induction at a nearby mine. “Eight of the deceased were burnt beyond recognition. “The saddest thing is that the passengers were young people who started working at the mine only on Monday.” The day before the accident, Community Safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala announced the road would be among those that would receive attention this year owing to the number of crashes there.
