ANKARA, TURKEY ~ MORE than 20 people have died from alcohol poisoning over the past month, according to media reports, as steep taxes on booze push Turks to consume bootlegged spirits. Broadcaster Haberturk reported at the weekend that a man in the southern province of Adana had died from methanol poisoning, the 12th such death in recent weeks in Adana. At least 23 people have died from alcohol poisoning across the nation, according to media reports. The deaths come as prices have surged after a government tax hike of at least 8% on most alcoholic beverages this month. A litre of Turkey’s traditional aniseed-flavoured raki spirit now costs more than 200 lira (R494). The Chamber of Chemical Engineers said the deaths were a direct result of the high taxes. “A litre of an alcoholic drink is equal to the three-day-wage of a worker with minimum pay. “Nowhere in the world are the taxes on alcoholic drinks higher than in Turkey,” the organisation said. Zafer Senyurt, chairman of the Chamber of Food Engineers in Istanbul, called on authorities to tighten controls on illegal booze. “The tariffs on alcoholic drinks and the oppressive attitude of the government on the consumption of alcoholic beverages result in illegally produced alcohol. The controls must be tightened,” Senyurt told BirGun newspaper. This month’s incidents followed repeated cases of alcohol poisoning in Turkey in recent years. In 2015, several people in Turkey died and others went blind from improperly mixing booze which can have a purity level of up to 95%. – REUTERS
