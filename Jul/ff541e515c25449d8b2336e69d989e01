GOGO Cynthia Motau celebrated her 63rd birthday with children at the Sinothando Daycare Centre in Alexandra, Joburg. The gogo from Mamelodi West, Tshwane, usually spent her birthday with her family. But on Wednesday she decided to spoil kids instead. “I was left speechless. I had tears in my eyes when I saw the many happy faces when they were told they would be celebrating my birthday with me,” she said. She said anything that had to do with educating young minds was very close to her heart. “We need to befriend them and protect our early development centres to ensure a better, safe future for the kids,” she said. The kids were spoiled with lunch and then cake and smiled all the way home with party packets in their backpacks. The gogo, who’s a businesswoman and a social worker, said she was touched when she saw the run-down state of their building. She called on all South Africans to give a helping hand to such centres. Sinothando principal Thandi Luruli said she was very happy the event took place at their centre. “Our kids were so excited.” She said they had a problem with space. “We have so many kids who are on the waiting list, but we are limited because of space,” she said. Luruli said they hoped to have more donors. The event was hosted in partnership with HomeComing Events, an organisation run by young people.
