THE family of a murdered security guard want his killers arrested. Mjedi Mkhize (58) and his colleague were shot at Folweni High School, south of Durban, on 22 June when gunmen stormed the school. Mkhize later succumbed to his injuries but his colleague is recovering. The daughter of the dead guard said: “He was everything to us. We never thought he was going to die such a painful death. “All he’d ever wanted when he became a security guard was to put food on the table for us. We don’t know what we’re going to do, now that he’s dead.” She said her father had been working as a security guard at the school since 2009. During the incident, Toyota Quantum engines and gearboxes donated to the school for mechanical technology practicals were stolen. An administration block and computer and science laboratories were damaged. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said: “Given the time he’d spent in hospital, we were hopeful he was going to survive. “Our prayers are with his family and all those who were close to him.” He was referring to Mkhize. Two weeks earlier, teacher Sibonakaliso Nyawose (48) was killed at Masuku Primary School in the same area. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said police were still investigating. No arrests had been made.
