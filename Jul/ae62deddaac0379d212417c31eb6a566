A WOMAN is worried that her family may be in danger after her daughter was robbed on Saturday. This after a gang pretending to be pastors performing religious acts robbed her 18-year-old daughter of her cellphone and a laptop in Phola near Ogies, Mpumalanga. According to the mother (37), her daughter went to buy bread at a nearby shop, but while she was walking home a man asked her about a salon around the area. “My daughter ignored them, but when one of the men prophesied saying she’d lose one of her siblings within seven days, my daughter spoke to them,” said the woman. “The man allegedly told her to go to her house and fetch her cellphone and laptop so they could pray.” She said they convinced her daughter to pray at the crossroads to prevent the bad things. “One of the men was told to pray in a house some distance away, and my daughter was sent to another house. “When she came back the people were nowhere to be seen and her phone and laptop were gone,” she said. “They could have done worse things to my daughter. I hope they’re caught before they do something bad to other people.” The daughter said: “I didn’t open a case because my things were not insured.” Lucas Mtshweni, chairman of Waya Waya Movement, said they will work with the community to find the thugs. Constable Thabang Ntuli advised the family to open a case.
