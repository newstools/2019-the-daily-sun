According to Gizacha Landabo, tuckshop owner in Maseding section in Makapanstad, North West, a man covered in blood stormed into his shop and tried to choke him. “I managed to pull his hands away from my throat and screamed for help. Then he punched me with his fists and left the shop,” said Gizacha. The man apparently threw bricks into the shop, breaking the fridges. Emily Motshaba (38) said they tried to help Gizacha. “But the man was very violent and left on his own,’’ she said. Mary Mafafo (59), whose windows were smashed, said she and her family locked themselves inside the house. “We still don’t know what drove him to attack our house.’’ Emily said cops were called to the scene and they managed to calm him down. “Before he was arrested the community gave him street justice,’’ she said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh told Daily Sun the 32-year-old suspect has been arrested. “He was charged with three cases of malicious damage to property. Myburgh said he will appear in the Moretele Magistrates Court soon. Daily Sun could not speak to the man’s relatives as the gates of the house were locked.
