MZANSI’s unemployment rate has jumped by 1,4% to 29% – the highest it’s been since 2008. This is according to figures released by Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke yesterday. Maluleke said the number of unemployed people increased by 455 000 to 6,7 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared with the previous quarter’s figures. “Of the 20,4 million young people aged 15-34 years, 40,3% were not in employment, education or training, which is a decrease of 0,3 percentage points compared to the first quarter of 2019,” Maluleke said. Marriam Manzini (45), a hawker, said news like this didn’t bother her because she had been unemployed for 10 years. “I make a few cents on the street so I can support my children,” she said. “My fear is for my children. “Will they ever be able to work and provide for themselves?” Phemolo Kati (20), a student at Tshwane College, said: “Being hired these days is just pure luck. People must pursue their small business ideas. “It must be of basic importance now that people create small businesses to survive because South Africa is just going down.”
