MZANSI-born stars Atandwa Kani and his father John Kani have been living in America for some time now and by the looks of things, they are having the time of their life. The duo has bragging rights after rubbing shoulders with some of the world’s most famous family – the Carters. Multi-Award winning Singer and actress Beyoncé Knowles- Carter is part of the The Lion King cast and so are the Kanis. This got the the opportunity to hang out with Queen B and her family at the premier of Lion King in Beverly Hills, California. Atandwa took to social media to share his experiences of meeting the Carter family and the impression they made on him. He captioned a picture, in which he is standing next to Beyoncé and her daughter Blue Ivy: “@beyonce is such a great person & so is Her amazing husband... Blue Ivy Carter is such a pleasant, brilliant, beautiful little lady... blessed!”. @beyonce is such a great person & so is Her amazing husband...
