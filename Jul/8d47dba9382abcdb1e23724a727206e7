 "WHAT
more can I ask for?” Those were the words of Banyana
Banyana striker Rhoda Mulaudzi after securing herself a deal with a Cyprus
club. Mulaudzi, who was part of the Banyana
squad at the Fifa Women’s World Cup which  came to an end in France in the
past weekend, has joined Apollon Ladies FC in Cyprus. The Limpopo-born
player was on the books of Australian outfit Canberra United, but her contract
came to an end just before the World Cup. Mulaudzi revealed that it all
started when she received an inbox of Facebook from the club
chairman. "The
vice-president of the club sent me an inbox asking
if I was available to join their team," Mulaudzi revealed. "At first I thought it was a
scam, but my faith pushed me to go ahead and probe further, and here I am today
seeing another dream come true." Malaudzi will now become the
third SA player to play in the Uefa Women Champions League following the likes
of Nompumelelo Nyandeni and Leandra Smeda. "I'excited about this move,
what makes me even happier is that I will be playing in the UEFA Women
Champions League which is the second highest level in the game after the World
Cup. "It is a dream dream come
true,”she added. “I am so excited about this move,
and I am almost certain it will open doors for other players to come this side.
I still don’t believe how it happened. “I am so happy I don’t even know
what to say – this is just a good indication that when God says yes no one can
say no. "He has been really amazing
to me – first taking me to Australia, then getting a chance again in the
national team, playing in the World Cup and now this, what more can I ask for?”
