IT WAS a slow start at Masonwabe Primary School in Delft, Cape Town, yesterday. This after 14 kids collapsed in the classroom last week. The education department said pupils’ attendance was lower than normal. Several parents accompanied their kids to school, while others went there to assess the situation. Parents had a short meeting with the principal, and some even called for a prayer to chase away evil spirits. “I will not dare bring my child here today. It’s too early after what happened on Thursday. I will only bring her when I’m certain an incident like that won’t happen again,” said parent Thozana Mjingelwa. “My child will not set her foot here this whole week.” Some parents said they apologised to the principal for treating him unfairly over the incident. A parent said: “I was part of the group that blamed the principal for not doing anything about the collapsing kids. But to be fair, the incident was a mystery and I believe it was evil spirits. The principal wasn’t at fault.” The education department confirmed the slow start at the school yesterday. Department spokeswoman Bronagh Hammond said: “The school is open and teaching and learning is taking place. “Pupil attendance is lower than usual. “The department has arranged for counselling for support.”
