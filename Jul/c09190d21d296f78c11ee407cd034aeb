ALTHOUGH there are only 12 shacks in the area, residents of Evaton in the Vaal, south of Joburg, want to be treated like others. They said they were tired of living without water and claimed their councillor was avoiding their calls. Luckyboy Miya (48) said they had been without water for three months. “We hate bothering people for water, but we have no choice,” he said. Luckyboy said the 12 families moved to the area in 2014 after they were chased away from where they lived. “Someone said he owned the land and would let us live here if we paid rent. We had water and electricity back then.” He said in 2016, they discovered the area was owned by the municipality. “We went straight to the councillor and he told us not to pay any rent.” Luckyboy said everything was fine until the beginning of May. “The water supply was cut. The councillor promised us water and he sent people to give us water. Those people wanted a reference number before installing anything. We have been waiting for a reference number and the councillor is not returning our calls anymore,” he said. Another resident said they had small children who needed water. Emfuleni municipal spokesman Sonqoba Kunene said the municipality would visit the affected area. “We will help supply water and gather information about the water supply challenge,” he said. Kunene said they would also check if the land belonged to the municipality or if it was privately owned.
