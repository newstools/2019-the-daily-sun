BACK in the old days, a man who killed a leopard would become a village hero. Although leopard skin is in huge demand in most kasis and sangomas apparently pay R25 000, the animal is protected. Killing it is against the law. A man in Uitenhage, Nelson Mandela Bay, learnt this the hard way on Tuesday. Rumours spread that he was keeping a leopard in his house. Sergeant Majola Nkohli said: “Police received information that a man was keeping a leopard at a house in Tiryville. “When they arrived in the area, a man was seen placing a skin of what was believed to be a leopard on his boundary wall. When he saw police, he fled the scene.” Cops confiscated the fresh skin and found a baboon head in the house. A case of breaking the Nature and Environmental Conservation Ordinance Act was opened for further investigation. “The suspect is known but is still at large. The docket was later transferred to the environmental management inspectorate.”
