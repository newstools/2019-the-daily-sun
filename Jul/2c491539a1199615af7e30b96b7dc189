THEY want traffic lights! They don’t want the pointsman who directs them into each other. Motorists told Daily Sun they’ve lost faith in the Ekurhuleni Metro Police pointsmen and would rather not have them at all. Residents and motorists said accidents happen almost every week. Yesterday morning, six cars were involved in two separate smashes at the corner of Welgedacht and Grootvaly Road in Springs near Payneville. Over 10 people were injured while a pointsman was on duty. Lindiwe Mnguni (26) from Springs said she couldn’t understand how she even got involved in the crash. “The one minute I was taking instructions, the next I had bumped into someone else’s car,” she said. Moses Mokoena (29) from Payneville said he remembered taking instruction from a pointsman and the next thing he knew, his car was on the side of the road. “This pointsman should be helping us move faster, not leading us into crashing each other. We ended up going to police stations for accident reports,” he said. Peter Mtshweni (28) said the pointsman called him to come. “Then I crashed into three others he also directed. These guys are directing us to our deathbeds,” Peter said. Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago confirmed the accidents and said they would investigate. “The outcome would help us decide how to resolve the issue. All locations seen as high accident zones are where we use necessary interventions by deploying a pointsman,” he said.
