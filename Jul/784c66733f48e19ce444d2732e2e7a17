RESIDENTS are tired of standing in long queues at this clinic. They are complaining about poor service delivery at Thanduxolo Clinic in Motherwell NU10, Port Elizabeth. Patients also accused staff of a lack of skills. As a result, they are often turned back without any help. One of the patients, Mandisa Ngele (54), told Daily Sun: “We stand in long queues every day waiting for our treatment. I was turned away on Tuesday without getting my medicine. “There is a possibility I might not get my pills today because the clinic is overcrowded and I am still in this long queue outside.” Another patient, Simanye Ngcamlela (42), said: “We queue here as early as 4am in order to be the first in the queue. At 4pm the nurses close the clinic and go home. The following day, they do not start where the queue ended.” “This is really stressful because there is no better working plan here. I was turned away three times because my medical folder is missing and I had to open a new one,” she said. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: “This is an operational matter that needs to be addressed with the clinic committee. “The clinic committee should put the interests of the community first.”
