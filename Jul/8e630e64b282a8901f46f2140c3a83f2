REIGNING Commonwealth Games and African Championships 100m champion Akani Simbine was in impressive form at the IAAF Diamond League in London on Saturday. Not only did he record his season best time as he blitzed home in 9.93 in the 100m final. The 25-year-old prevailed over local favourite Zarnel Hughes, who finished second in 9.95, but most significantly also edged former world champion Yohan Blake (9.97). It may be early days, but Simbine appears to be getting in shape for the World Championship in Doha in September. "I'm really happy with the time," Simbine said. "I came here to get the Diamond League points and make sure I get the win to build confidence, and (instead) I've come away with a season's best. It's always amazing running here and I'm just pleased to come out healthy and finish on top."
