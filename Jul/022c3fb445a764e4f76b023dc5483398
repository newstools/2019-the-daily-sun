SO far DJ and producer has given back over 2000 pairs of school shoes to children in and around his community in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni... He did it again yesterday when he gave out a handed out 400 pairs of shoes to learners at Mashemong Primary School in Tembisa as it was their first day back to school after the winter holidays. Speaking to Daily Sun, Shimza (real name Ashley Raphala) said: “It was dope seeing how the kids were happy. It gave most of them hope and the recipients of the shows were very excited. Even though not all them got shoes, they were happy for the ones that did.” He told the People’s Paper that Shimza’s shoe drive has been taking place for about 5 years and he hosts an annual Christmas party for kids in Tembisa on 25 December during the day, before he hosts his annual One Man Show. At the Christmas part he organises food, jumping castles and other activities to accommodate those who are in need and never get to fully celebrate Christmas because of their disadvantaged back rounds. In January he uses the proceeds to purchase uniform for kids who are in need. Back to school ?????? A post shared by  SHIMZA (@shimza.dj) on Jul 8, 2019 at 11:35pm PDT
