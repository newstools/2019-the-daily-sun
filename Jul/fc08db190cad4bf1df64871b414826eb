WHEN the Zwilibi family heard their three loved ones had been killed, they didn’t know how they would bury them. No one in the family is working, but they recently received donations to bury their kids. Family member Nombulelo Ngayeka said: “We don’t know the people who donated the money. “But we’re grateful to them because we didn’t know how we would have buried our loved ones.” Another family member, Buntu Zwilibi, said: “We understand that when some people offer help, they don’t want their names to be revealed. But we want them to know we’re grateful.” Buntu said the Good Samaritans got their banking details from some journalists. “We heard they read our sad story, and that we needed money for the burial. “We were surprised when we received the amount because we never expected to get so much cash.” Another relative, Portia Gamtela, said: “We are grateful to the people who’ve came through for us.” Sonwabo, Sikelela and Aphiwe Zwilibi will be buried in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, on Saturday.
