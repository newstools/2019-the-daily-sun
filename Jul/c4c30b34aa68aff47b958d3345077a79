A MEDICAL doctor will appear in court today after he was arrested on Friday during a roadblock. The road block was initiated by North West Safety and Transport MEC Sello Lehari. The doctor from Wolmaransstad was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. He was arrested on the N12 in Klerksdorp. Lehari kicked off the road block with a short briefing, followed by a parade inspection. He was accompanied by various top officials from his department as well as police brigadiers. Lehari engaged with motorists and handed over gift bags in honour of Nelson Mandela and Mandela Month. The roadblock continued to the Potchefstroom Weighbridge, along the N12. Lehari said he wanted to ensure law enforcement officials were more visible on the roads. He urged motorists to drive safely, avoid speeding, wear seat belts and ensure their vehicles are roadworthy.
