A BURST underground pipe outside the offices of two councillors has angered residents. They said water’s been flowing continuously from the pipe at the offices of councillors Mendisa Makunga of ward 56 and Mambalu Mgcokoca of ward 58 on Mkombe Street, Motherwell. They share the same premises. Residents said it was wrong for water to be wasted like that as it was a scarce commodity in Nelson Mandela Bay. Anelisa Mukeyi (53) of ward 56 said she was angry this was happening in front of councillors’ offices as they should lead by example. She told Daily Sun: “This is shocking. We expect them to quickly report this to the municipality, but this has been going on for weeks. “There is a drought in the metro and water should be preserved.” Ward 58 resident Moses Moloi said: “These councillors expect residents to save water when they are not leading by example. This is not good.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said councillors should report the problem themselves to the municipality. Mambalu said this did not fall under her ward. “It is ward 56, but they reported the case long ago to the municipality. We expect municipal officials to fix it,” he said. Efforts to get comment from Mendisa were fruitless. Her assistants refused to give Daily Sun her cellphone number. They said they didn’t give journalists councillors’ contact numbers.
