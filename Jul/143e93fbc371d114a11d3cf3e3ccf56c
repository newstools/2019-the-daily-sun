BAFANA Bafana defender Sifiso Hlanti says he does not fear facing Egypt's Mo Salah in Saturday's last-16 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tie. Hlanti is regarded as Bafana's first choice left back under coach Stuart Baxter but has struggled in the competition along with compatriot Thamsanqa Mkhize at right-back. The national team reached the last-16 in fortuitous fashion after winning just one match in the group stages with two defeats. This clash is set to take place at Cairo International Stadium in Egypt'son Saturday evening (9pm). With Salah playing on the right flank for his national team where he also does for Liverpool in the English Premier League, it seems the 29-year-old is in for a tough time. However, the player says he is unafraid of the Reds superstar: "There is nothing we are afraid of. We also have good players."If we can switch on as players and take things in a positive manner with the right attitude, we can make things happen against Egypt. So we are not going to give them too much respect."I have a feeling that we can make things happen, not only for us but for the county, as they have been waiting for something to happen."It's a learning curve to play against players who are playing in Europe. That's what I'm always looking forward to, in order to compete with the best. I won't put pressure on myself, but I'm not afraid of anyone."
