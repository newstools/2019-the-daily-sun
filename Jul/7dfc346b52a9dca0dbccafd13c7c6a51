HIGHLANDS PARK are not too worried about their new signing, veteran goalkeeper Greg Etafia, who hasn’t played football since 2016. Etafia (36) has been signed by Lions of the North for the upcoming season after a three-year absence. The former Nigeria international’s move was necessitated by Highlands’ by captain and goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini’s injury. “Etafia impressed me at training,” said coach Owen da Gama. Etafia’s last match in the PSL was at Moroka Swallows in the play-off game against Black Leopards. That match confirmed Swallows’ relegation to the National First Division (NFD) after they finished second from bottom in the 2014/15 season. He then coached the Dube Birds in the NFD the following season but he was only in charged of the three league matches as Soweto giants lost all three matches. Added Gama: “He’s living a clean life, absolutely professional. As much as he’s 36, you can’t see that at training because the amount of work he’s putting is phenomenal. I’m not only signing him to play, but also to inspire our players on and off the field.” Before Etafia joined the Tembisa-based club, he had the short stint as Baroka FC’s goalkeeper-coach in the 2017/18 season. Since Etafia arrived in South Africa to join Swallows in 2003 from Platueu United in his homeland, Highlands will be his second club in the PSL. He spent 12 years with Soweto giants side, playing over 300 games. At the club, he won the Absa Cup in 2004, Nedbank Cup in 2009 and the MTN8 trophy in 2012-13 season. He was sadly disappointed when Swallows were pipped to the podium by Orlando Pirates in the last league match in 2011-12 season.
