CIVIL
rights watch dog AfriForum will be approaching the courts to force the National
Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to make a decision regarding the prosecution of the
Economic Freedom Fighter Leader, Julius Malema. They
announced this during a media briefing at their offices in Tshwane. AfriForum
indicated that they will approach the courts with a mandamus application to
force the NPA to make decisions regarding the prosecution of Malema, concerning
three pending cases against him. Afriforum
CEO, Kallie Kriel said the three cases in which Malema is implicated included
the corrupt activities of the company On-Point Engineering, his alleged assault
of a policeman, as well as firing off shots with an assault rifle. He said
they were compelled to take this step after the NPA unnecessarily kept
postponing their decisions regarding Malema’s prosecution despite repeated
requests by them. “AfriForum’s
Private Prosecution Unit also indicated in a letter to the NPA that the
organisation will apply for nolle prosequi certificates to privately prosecute
Malema themselves, should the NPA decide not to prosecute him,” he said. He said the
NPA has however still not decided on whether to prosecute Malema and also
failed to supply valid reasons to AfriForum for the delay in having justice
prevail. Kriel said
the NPA’s failure to quickly prosecute Malema for this alleged crime is a
disgraceful negligence of their duty and creates a false impression that EFF
commander was above the law. “We want to
send out a clear message with its legal action against the NPA that Malema is
not considered to be above the law. Malema is pretending to be an advocate for
the poor, but is instead enriching himself and his family by allegedly
committing fraud and tender corruption,” he said He said if
the NPA was not willing or not able to prosecute Malema for these crimes,
AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit will gladly take over the reins.
