FREE State Education MEC Tate Makgoe tested tablets to be supplied to schools on Tuesday. The devices, which use a type of closed internet network, are provided in partnership with the Closed-Loop Learner Network. The network makes digital textbooks and educational resources freely available to pupils and teachers in poor schools through the use of tablets. The tablets are customised and preloaded with educational websites. Makgoe said: “President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that we need to prepare our pupils for the fourth industrial revolution. Today, we are here to test the devices with pupils to say to them we expect your results to improve. “The pupils were all excited about the devices and showed interest. Some said they would help them do research and they could use them during their holidays. “The devices are going to cover grades 10, 11 and 12. We’re going to pilot them at three schools. If we see they produce good results, we will use them throughout the Free State.” Ajit Gopalakrishnan of Closed-Loop said they started distributing the tablets to Vulamasango High School in Bloemfontein last year. “We engaged pupils so they could give us feedback on how the devices work. A few of them identified some small problems but the majority was happy. These devices are not for chatting but for educational purposes,” he said. Grade 11 pupil Nomsa Hlongoane (16) said the tablets would help them as they wouldn’t have to carry so many books.
