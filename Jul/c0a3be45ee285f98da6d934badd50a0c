HE was connecting izinyoka cables in rainy weather on Wednesday, and it cost him his life. Captain Andre Beetge said a man in his early 20s was electrocuted. He’d been trying to make an illegal connection at the Ramaphosa squatter camp in Motherwell, Nelson Mandela Bay. “There were many loose wires in the storm drain,” said Beetge. “He was apparently killed while trying to connect the wire.” An inquest docket has been opened. A resident said he paid izinyoka R400 to have his shack connected to the power grid. “Izinyoka are ordinary men who go around looking for customers. But it’s a very dangerous job,” the resident said. He called on the municipality to speed up electrification of the squatter camp. Another resident said her two kids lived with her mother in Uitenhage as she feared they’d be electrocuted, were they to live with her in Ramaphosa. “I’ll only bring them when there’s legal electricity.” Nelson Mandela Bay head of infrastructure and engineering, Andile Lungisa, recently told Daily Sun that squatter camps would soon be electrified. “The contractors are already on site and we’re talking to the communities,” said Lungisa.
