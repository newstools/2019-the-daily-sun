DEPUTY Minister Njabulo Nzuza has promised to fix the long queues at the Umgeni Road Home Affairs in Durban. Nzuza was visiting the branch yesterday ahead of the department’s budget vote tomorrow, where he’ll report to parliament on what he saw. Dumisani Gwala (35) from Maphephetheni in Ndwedwe, north of Durban, said he arrived at the office at 5am. After talking to people waiting in long queues, Nzuza said he was concerned. He promised to address the problem as soon as possible. He said he was aware of problems facing people who visit Home Affairs offices throughout the country. “I have spoken to people and some told me they arrived here at 3am to be first in the queue. “We’re not here to complain as government officials but to see the problem for ourselves and fix it.” He said problems at the branch were caused mainly by Durban’s growing population. Home Affairs needed new technology to cope with the growing number of people who needed IDs. Gwala had come to apply for a smart ID card.
