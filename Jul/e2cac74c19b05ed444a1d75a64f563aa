A 44-year-old woman was arrested for allegedly stealing from her employer. According to Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) the employer discovered the theft estimated at almost R300 000. She explained that the valuables were hidden in her bedroom cupboard for a period of three months and could not confirm exactly when it had been stolen. “Reaction Officers established that the victim had recently employed a domestic worker. Officers interviewed the woman who confirmed that she had stolen the jewellery and cash over a period,” Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram said. The stolen goods were reportedly sold to a Nigerian national who runs a cash for gold business in the Verulam CBD. He also allegedly paid her R8500 for 1000 U.S Dollars which she had also stolen. “After further questioning, it was established that the suspect had four pieces of jewellery at her home in Waterloo, Verulam” “RUSA members proceeded to the residence where she handed over a woman's Raymond Weil watch, two bangles and a gold neck chain. The Nigerian businessman was also interviewed and claimed to have no knowledge of the sale and stated that he had never seen the suspect before,” Balram said. Balram said RUSA officers contacted the suspect’s previous employer who confirmed that she had allegedly stolen from their residence whilst she was employed as a domestic worker.
