MANY people believe the Mandela Bridge is one of the most beautiful on the continent. At night its bright lights catch the eye and tourists visiting Joburg take photos of it. The Mandela Bridge has been used on popular TV series, The River, during a heist scene. In February 2011, designer David Tlale sent out 92 models down the bridge, each one representing every year of Tata’s life. It was part of his autumn/winter collection, Made in the City, which was shown at the Joburg Fashion Week in the same year. However, the bridge named after Mzansi’s first democratic president, has recently been making the news for all the wrong reasons. SunReaders shared their stories about the bridge on Facebook, and this is what they had to say. I think they should get 24 -hour heavy security. Police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele said there had been an increase in robberies there during the day, despite the introduction of security guards. “The guards at the bridge are working hand in hand with the police,” he said. According to Mbele, there were also a lot of incidents at night. The bridge is the link between Braamfontein where there are a lot of students, and the Joburg CBD where people catch taxis. Mbele said many of the crime victims had reported theft of their cellphones, laptops and cash. He advised people to walk in groups at night to avoid being crime victims. Joburg Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said security guards are stationed at the bridge to protect students. He said they deployed crime intervention unit patrols regularly. “We also have the crime reaction unit assisting us with CCTV. “We have arrested a few suspects, thanks to the footage.”
