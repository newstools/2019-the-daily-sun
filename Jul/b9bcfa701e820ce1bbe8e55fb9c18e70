“MY brother is innocent!” These were the words of Oupa Mothupi (45), whose brother Manusi (40) was arrested in May for allegedly stabbing a homeless person in Muckleneuk, Tshwane. Oupa told Daily Sun: “My brother’s rights were violated and he was not fairly treated. I was shocked when I received a call saying he had been arrested,” he said. Oupa told the SunTeam there was no way Manusi would have committed such a crime. Muckleneuk has been in the spotlight recently after the bodies of five middle-aged homeless men were found in the area. Cops had not linked the killings to Manusi. Oupa said at the time of the stabbing, Manusi was not even living in Tshwane. He said he was at a hostel in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. “What is happening to my brother is very painful and we blame the police for the way they are handling his case,” he said. Oupa said his brother was a completely normal person. “He grew up in front of me and he’s a Christian,” he said. Manusi’s case was being heard in the Pretoria Magistrates Court and was postponed to the end of this month for further investigation. Gauteng NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said: “The accused abandoned his bail application and will remain in custody.” She said the NPA had charged Manusi with attempted murder.
