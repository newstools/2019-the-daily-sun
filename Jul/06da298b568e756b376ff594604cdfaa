THERE was joy on the streets of Delft on Sunday when a man who went missing six years ago was welcomed back by family and friends. Mentally ill Denzil Daniels (30) was found in eSwatini two weeks ago after he went missing in 2013. After the family held a memorial service for Denzil in 2016, his mum Jane (60) explained what she went through when she saw her son in eSwatini for the first time. “It feels good seeing my son again,” she said. “I didn’t even know how to hug him and keep him in my arms. “I give thanks to the Lord who made it all possible.” Jane couldn’t stop heaping praise on Warrant Officer Michael Daniels and Constable Emile Faroa from Delft’s missing persons unit, who drove her to eSwatini. “If it weren’t for them, my son wouldn’t be here today. “Those two are my heroes. They went all the way to eSwatini with me and made it possible for us to celebrate today.” According to the cops, Jane fainted when they broke the news to the family about finding their missing relative. She couldn’t believe the news. They said they applied for leave and drove with the mum to fetch her son after they found out he was in eSwatini. Michael said: “I told Emile, ‘Let’s go to Delft community police chairman, pastor Charles George’. “When we went to him and told him the story, he said we’d make a plan and offered his Golf 7 to fetch Denzil.” Charles said: “We had the forum behind this whole process. “We collected funds and want to thank the Gift of the Givers, which played a big role in all of this.” Jane wanted answers about how Denzil ended up in eSwatini but was happy that he’s back.
