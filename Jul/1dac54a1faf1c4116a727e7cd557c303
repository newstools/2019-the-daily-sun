SIYANDA Ntenga’s humble beginning have made him a giving person. The 35-year-old businessman from Durban has committed himself to donating school shoes to as many kids from disadvantaged homes as he can. He founded Ntenga’s School Shoes, which manufactures them from scratch, and has donated around 1 500 pairs of shoes to kids across the country. He told Daily Sun he started the company in 2017. “I used to buy the shoes with my own money but it was expensive. Being a business-minded person, I decided to start my own manufacturing company,” he said. Siyanda said he hired six people to work for the company and it helped him save money while also creating employment. He said the reason he wanted to help kids was because he personally knew the pain of not having school shoes. “When I was growing up, I didn’t have shoes for school and that affected me negatively. I made a promise that no child should have to go through what I did,” he said. “Not having shoes affects your self esteem and it makes it difficult to perform well in class.”
