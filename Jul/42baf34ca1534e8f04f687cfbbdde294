THE RAKGOALE family is desperate! The family of five from Shilubana-Mine View Village in Tzaneen, Limpopo was attacked by villagers in May and their ten-roomed house and belongings, including three cars, were burnt to ashes. Community headman David Rakgoale (58) was apparently accused of turning his back on his community. David told the People’s Paper that people threw heavy stones at his house before it was torched. “Thank God we escaped from the scene without injuries.” He said his family was shocked because they had never fought with any of the residents. “We fear going back because we feel we are no longer welcome in the village.” He said during the attack, people threatened to bury them in the flames. “I really don’t know what we’ve done. Hearing my children screaming for help was the worst experience of my life. “We tried to talk to the people but none of them would listen to us,” he said. He said life was getting hard. “We need shelter, food and clothes because we escaped with only the clothes we had on.” David said he had no plan to survive because all his business materials were burned with the house. His wife Pulane Sebela (40) said the attack made her kids feel sad. “We are being hunted and we don’t feel safe at all. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said no arrests have been made so far. “Investigations are still continuing.” He said cases of intimidation and damage to property were opened.“We urge residents not to take the law into their hands if they claim wrongdoing.”
