NOMFUNEKO Dlangamandla (41) needs help for her son. The mum from Lower Crossroads in Philippi East, Cape Town, said her son Sihle (21) started using drugs when he was 12. “He claims he only uses dagga, but I can tell it’s not only dagga. “I’m worried because the drugs make him slow. “When I send him to the shop, he comes back and asks the same thing over and over again,” Nomfuneko said. She said she wanted her son in rehab as some people in the area were sending him to buy tik for them. “Even though he denies smoking tik, I can tell he’s smoking it.” She said Daily Sun was her only hope. “I’ve read stories of young addicts who were helped through the paper. I hope I’ll also get help for my son.” Sihle confirmed to the SunTeam that he smoked dagga. “I want to go to rehab,” he said. Joshua Chigome, a spokesman for Western Cape Social Development MEC Sharna Fernandez, said their department was willing to assist where they could. “We will get someone from our department to call her and help in this matter,” said Chigome.
