GLADYS Rulumeni (49) has been struggling to deal with the death of her son at an initiation. On top of having to organise her 26-year-old son Anele’s funeral, her other son, Wandisile (21), will be coming home from initiation school a day before his brother is buried. Gladys said both her sons were circumcised on 14 June, and Anele died a week later. “My heart is bleeding. I thought my sons would come back home healthy men,” said the mum from Qumbu Village, near Mthatha. She said her sons were supposed to go to initiation school last year, but they both fell ill. “Before they went to the initiation school this year, the doctor who examined them said they were healthy.” She said she was told before Anele died, his heart was beating slowly and he felt dizzy. “I don’t blame anyone for his death, but I don’t know how I will bury him. My son worked as a shepherd and we depended on his wages for survival.” So far, the initiation season in the province has claimed the lives of 14 initiates. Mamnkeli Ngam, a spokesman for co-operative governance and traditional affairs, said 24 iingcibi were arrested for unlawful circumcisions. “We’ll be working closely with the NPA to ensure they get sentences suited to their crimes.” Ngam said most of the deaths were caused by dehydration.
