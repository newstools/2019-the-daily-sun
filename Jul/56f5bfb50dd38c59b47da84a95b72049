HEAVILY pregnant Shirley Manoto (35) should be focusing on her unborn child – but instead she is worried about her husband. “He wants to make his nyatsi his second wife,” said Shirley, from Protea Glen, Soweto. She said the nyatsi, Refilwe Rakoma (38) told her she’s prepared to be the second wife and if Shirley doesn’t want her, she must divorce her husband. Shirley’s husband, Tebogo Manoto (36), left home six months ago and has been staying with his parents in Meadowlands, Soweto, not far from his nyatsi’s house “I suspect the nyatsi must have done something to him. He’s not the man I fell in love with,” Shirley said. “But I’m not going to allow him to marry her and I won’t divorce him.” Shirley said they have been married for 13 years and have a daughter. “I found out he fathered a child outside our marriage last year,” she said. Daily Sun went to the nyatsi’s home in Meadowlands, zone 7. She told the SunTeam she’s prepared to be his second wife. “His wife harasses me and I’m going to open a case against her. I have a two-year-old son with this man,” she said. The nyatsi’s mum said Shirley must leave her daughter alone. “Her husband sleeps over sometimes. They have a child together.” Tebogo told Daily Sun he had discussed the situation with his wife. “I love my wife and I’m not going to divorce her. But yes, I have a woman and I’ve had a child with her.” Shirley’s cousin Onkgopotse Moatshe said Tebogo can’t make another woman pregnant and then tell his wife afterwards.
