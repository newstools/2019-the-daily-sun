GOGO Nowayilesi Cila said although she was grateful God had given her a long life, it would have been better if her husband was with her. The 101-year-old from Kuyasa in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, celebrated her birthday on Saturday surrounded by friends and family. The gogo said her husband died over 20 years ago, but she’s not stopped thinking about him. She said her long life would have been nicer if she could have shared it with him. “I always dream about him. I dream we’re holding hands, and when I wake up I continue thinking about him,” said Nowayilesi. The gogo had tips for eating healthily. “I eat vegetables a lot, and when I eat meat I eat pork. I hardly eat red meat. “I think this kind of food keeps me healthy. I hardly go to the clinic.” Lumka Mpayisi, owner of Ascendis Health Spa, went to gogo’s house to give her a massage as she often complains of a stiff back. “It helps her body relax. We’ve been visiting her since last year to massage her,” she said. Lumka was one of the people who contributed to gogo’s huge 100-year birthday party last year. Gogo’s daughter Buyelwa (64) said: “It’s special to have your parent alive at my age. We continue to ask God to keep her healthy.”
