PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa must give an undertaking that he will not use state funds to foot his legal bill if he decides to fight the public protector’s findings against him on the Bosasa donations. This was the demand by the DA in a letter written to the Presidency as it has emerged that Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s findings may not be favourable. Mkhwebane is investigating a R500 000 donation by controversial company Bosasa into Ramaphosa’s campaign for the ANC presidency. Reports have since emerged that Ramaphosa is preparing to take the matter on review, as he anticipated that the findings would not be in his favour. Now DA leader Mmusi Maimane wants Ramaphosa to promise that he will not use government money to launch a review of the findings. Maimane reminded Ramaphosa about a court ruling in the former president Jacob Zuma’s case after his party challenged the use of state money to defend Zuma in his corruption case. He further reminded him that the court agreed with Ramaphosa when, in court papers, he agreed that public money should not be used to cover strictly personal matters.
