THEY only care about us when people get killed. This is according to many residents of Marikana squatter camp in Philippi East, Cape Town, who are complaining about the promised high mast lighting that has never worked. Community leader Xolani Thukwayo told Daily Sun the municipality doesn’t care about them. “We are victims of criminals. “After 11 people were killed in one day in 2017, the city promised to install high mast lights but only one mast was installed and it is not even working,” he said. Linamandla Myolwa (34) said the city will never take them seriously. “Maybe they want other lives to be lost before they install the lights. “City officials lie a lot especially when they see media people but as soon as the media stops reporting about a particular area, the city stops acting on its promises,” she said. MMC for Energy Councillor Phindile Maxiti said Marikana is built on private properties which are part of a court case. “Electricity infrastructure and lighting cannot be installed there,” said Maxiti. He said they can install services on the side of the area. “Marikana is in the flight path of Cape Town International Airport and only five masts can be installed along Sheffield Road due to height restrictions,” he said. Maxiti said the city is making every effort to provide appropriate public lighting in the metro including in Philippi. “The city is surveying all high mast areas for outages of mast lights,” said Maxiti.
