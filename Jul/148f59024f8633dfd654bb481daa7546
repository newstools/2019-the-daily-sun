The first troops of the South African National Defence Force
(SANDF) have finally landed in the Cape Flats - with members of the army seen
entering the suburb of Manenberg on Thursday. Videos on social media show SANDF vehicles riding through
Manenberg roads in Cape Town, while other pictures show individual armed
soldiers walking through some of the neighbourhood's streets. News24 understands that "everything is done" with
regards to the SANDF's deployment papers â€“ the legal process which had held
back the deployment since last week. Police Minister Bheki Cele announced last Thursday that the
army would be visiting 10 troubled precincts on the Cape Flats in Cape Town, to
assist with the fight against violent crime and gangsterism. Having undergone mission readiness training since Friday,
the troops were now ready to be deployed. Earlier, at an unrelated army briefing at the Castle of Good
Hope on Thursday, SANDF spokesperson Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi smiled but
was tight-lipped when asked when the army would be deployed. However, the army's chaplain general, Brigadier General
Monwabisi Jamangile, said he was "praying for the deployments".  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/watch-army-seen-entering-manenberg-on-the-cape-flats-20190718
