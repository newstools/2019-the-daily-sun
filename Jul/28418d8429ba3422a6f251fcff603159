A cash-in-transit van driver appeared in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court today on charges of robbery. The 32-year-old suspect was arrested on the 26 July 2019 for alleged armed robbery. His case was postponed to August 28 for a bail application. The Hawks’ National Bureau for Illegal Firearms Control and Priority Violent Crime Unit linked the suspect to a cash-in-transit heist that occurred at Bayside Food Centre on 25July 2019. The security crew reportedly collected cash at the centre and on their return to the cash van was missing. Police spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said the cash van was later recovered at Noxolo Street in Langa. Nkwalase said the driver was unharmed whilst an undisclosed amount of cash and his firearm were taken. According to the accused, he was approached by three suspects who threatened him with bombing the cash van. “They allegedly disarmed him before instructing him to drive to a location where they offloaded an undisclosed amount of money before they fled the scene,” Nkwalase said.
