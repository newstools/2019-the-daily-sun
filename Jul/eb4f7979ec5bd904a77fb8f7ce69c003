PEOPLE fear for their lives as no one knows why the innocent women were killed. Six women were randomly shot in Marcus Garvey in Philippi East, Cape Town on Friday night. Two gunmen allegedly went on the rampage and killed the women aged from to 18 to 26. Resident Nokubonga Funani (37) told Daily Sun they were shocked. “We are asking ourselves what happened and why these women were killed.” She thought someone was being robbed when she heard gunshots. “We’re living in a cruel world where people are not afraid to kill others.” Lindelani Maduna (45) said crime was high in the area. “A lot of bad things have been happening here. They just don’t make it into the newspapers.” He said the victims were enjoying themselves when the incident happened. “Two were in one room in the shack, while four were in another room,” he said. Lindelani said nothing was taken from them, which made them wonder why they were killed. “This is a mess and it has left the whole community shaken,” he said. He said it was strange that the women were shot execution-style. “It looks like a message was being sent,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: “Unknown gunmen entered and opened fire. The motive for the murders is unknown and circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.” No suspects have been arrested.
