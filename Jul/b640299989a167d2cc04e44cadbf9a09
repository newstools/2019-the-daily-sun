Sandile Mahlangu (26) uses music to help him take on the role of Cheezboi on Isithembiso. “Everyone has different music that speaks to their souls,” the actor from Middelburg, Mpumalanga said. “I tell myself this character listens to this kind of music. It’s like a magnet pulling me to Cheezboi.” Cheezboi pretends to be his dead friend Chester Sokhele. “He has a lot of darkness in him but I think of him as someone willing to do anything to protect those he loves.” Sandile is also a model but his first love is acting. “The two work well together. Modelling helped me move into acting. “I focus on what I want since I know where I come from. In grade 10, I was chosen to be trained as an electrician and then worked in mining.” But then he was electrocuted. “God whispered in my ear that if I survived, I could do anything. I then studied electrical engineering.” After that, he went into modelling and commercials. Sandile is grateful his parents gave him the freedom to follow his passion “They could have stopped me but allowed me to go ahead and make them proud,” he said.
