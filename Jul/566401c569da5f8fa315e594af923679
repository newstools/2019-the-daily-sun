ELIZABETH Masilo (27), Dieketseng Makete (33) and Maxwell Nhapo (31), are recovering drug addicts who have not given up on life. The three who live in Orlando, Soweto, have done bad things and don’t want anybody else to go through the same things. So, they formed a movement called Change. Dieketseng said she became addicted to drugs in 2002 after losing both her mother and sister. “I started visiting friends to forget about my heartache and started using drugs,” she said. She said many of her friends have died. “I passed out one day and I was taken to hospital. My lung was ripped apart from smoking nyaope so I decided to quit in April.” Elizabeth said one day she was drunk at a party and taken to a friend’s house. “She gave me a drug and told me it will make me sober,” she said. “The drug I had taken was crystal meth. That is when I got hooked.” She said she lost her job and started stealing. She took anything she could get her hands on. “I used to run away from home and stay on the streets. My family would help me get clean and buy me new clothes that I would sell,” she said. Maxwell said he is still trying his best to stop. “When I try stopping my body gets painful. I keep going back but I will leave it behind,” he said. He said they started their movement because they understand how difficult it is to stop. “We look for people who sell scrap to get cash to get for drugs. We have been there and want to help them,” he said.
