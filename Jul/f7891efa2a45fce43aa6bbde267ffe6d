AS THE winter chill grips the country, most people have bought new blankets and turned on their heaters – but have forgotten about all the homeless people. According to a 2015 study by the Human Sciences Resource Centre, about 200 000 people in Mzansi are homeless. According to Mary Gillet-de Klerk of the Joburg Organisation of Services for the Homeless, over 100 000 of them live in Joburg. She said homeless people are thought to make up 1% of Joburg’s population. The SunTeam recently hit Jozi’s streets to speak to homeless people about their struggles. Wesley Naidoo (29) from Phoenix in Durban said he came to Joburg early last year looking for help to get off drugs. “I checked out a rehabilitation centre online and the place looked like it would help me out but when I got there, it didn’t look like the advertisement,” he said. “The place was a dump. I stayed there for a while and as I thought, it didn’t help. I left and have been on the streets since.” Wesley said being homeless in Joburg was terrible, especially in winter. “The cold hits you hard. It doesn’t help that no one seems to care about us. “The owners of private buildings and security guards at government buildings kick us off street corners in the early hours of the morning.” Another homeless man said he moved from Cape Town to Joburg after his parents divorced 14 years ago. He came to live with his gogo. “She died soon after that and then my mum. There was a family fight for the house and I found myself on the street. You are trapped by the system and can’t hold down a job because you look shabby and lose documents.”
