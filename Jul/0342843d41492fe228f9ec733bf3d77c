THINGS were back to normal in Umlazi, south of Durban, yesterday after warring taxi associations reached an agreement. Taximen under the Engonyameni and MNR associations returned to work. MNR drivers went on strike on Wednesday after two of their colleagues were shot dead by unknown people. The attack was believed to have been organised by Engonyameni bosses after MNR owners stopped their taxis from using the route to Durban. An MNR taxi owner told Daily Sun at the weekend they agreed to allow Engonyameni taxis use the route while talks continued. He said they reached an agreement after realising passengers were badly affected. “We sat and looked at the situation. Passengers have been begging us to resolve our problems because they’re affected. “We decided to allow their taxis back on the route while trying to find a permanent solution.” A driver yesterday said they received calls from their bosses telling them to return to work as the problem had been resolved. He said they had no problem working as long as they were safe. The driver said many owners were concerned and worried their taxis would be repossessed by banks if the strike continued. Transport spokesman Mluleki Mntungwa said a task team sent by MEC Mxolisi Kaunda helped the associations come to an agreement this weekend. The team would continue working to find a lasting solution.
