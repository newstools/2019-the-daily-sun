BE A magosha in your own bedroom! This is the advice for married women from Bishop Dununu Msibi, a well-known TV preacher, psychologist and marriage counsellor. In a video shared on Facebook, Dununu, of the Church of Warriors for Christ in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, said women should find out the things magoshas do. “Once you know what they do, then do it. Your men will never go to them again,” he said. He said old people should tell young makotis to go out there and be flexible. “You can cook for him, you can wash and iron for him and clean the house for him, but still he will go out and cheat. What matters is what you do to him in the bedroom. Do things that will excite him,” he said. “Do things for your husband that will leave him exhausted and not wanting anything else.” Dununu’s services are called “harsh realities of marriage”. He told Daily Sun that in his monthly services he spoke about things other pastors were afraid of. “I touch on sensitive topics like sex,” he said. “My aim is to revive marriages and fight against the scourge of divorce in communities.” Although people always laugh at his talks that isn’t his goal, he said. “I touch on issues that affect them so they can go and get help,” he said. His services are free and are held on the third week of every month. Nonhlanhla Nkabinde (45) and her husband, Mnqobi Khumalo (50), told Daily Sun they didn’t miss the bishop’s services. “We were close to divorcing when we heard of Bishop Dununu. Things he talked about made us fix our marriage,” said Nonhlanhla. Magabela Mhlongo said: “Because we are worshippers we were afraid to do other things in the bedroom. “But attending the pastor’s services has opened our eyes.”
