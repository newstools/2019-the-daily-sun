A lot of people like complaining about
BMW's reliability issues. Go to every post about BMW from a motoring site,
you'll find someone complaining about BMW's reliability issues. But it seems like automakers don't care. From Toyota to Morgan BMW engines seem to find themselves under the bonnets of cars without a blue propeller badge on. The list is set to grow longer now with Jaguar Land Rover products rumoured to get beating hearts from Munich. According to a report by Autocar Jaguar Land Rover and BMW are set to extend their partnership beyond developing
electric powertrains as reported earlier this year. The report claims that BMW will be supplying Jaguar Land Rover with 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder powerplants with and without electric enhancements. The move for struggling Jaguar Land Rover is seen as a measure to reduce investment in combustion
engines and help focus their time and resources on electric powertrains. BMW, on the other hand, is looking to make more money by increasing volume beyond Mini, Rolls-Royce and their BMW cars. With governments and regulation authorities forever making it difficult and more expensive to produce combustion engines. Automakers are always on the lookout for cost-cutting measure. Through partnerships like this. They can do that. And keep petrolheads happy. So the next Jaguar F-Type could be spotting BMW's brilliant S55 engine, which is not a bad thing at all.
