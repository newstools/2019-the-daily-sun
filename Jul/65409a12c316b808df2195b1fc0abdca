THE Semelanes were waiting to start lobola negotiations for their daughter when they heard screams outside their gate on Saturday. They were shocked when they heard that the groom’s family was robbed of R20 000. But the family members from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni said they suspected something fishy. Ida Semelane (60), whose daughter Phumeza (36) was getting married, told Daily Sun the negotiations were supposed to happen in May, but the groom’s family postponed. “I was outside when I heard the groom screaming that they’d robbed at gunpoint and the robbers had fled in a car. I was puzzled because I heard nothing of that nature,” she said. It’s understood the couple has been together for 10 years and has two children together. The groom was apparently with two family members when the incident happened. “I said we should phone the police, but they insisted I shouldn’t,” she said. One of the uncles, Siphiwe Semelane, said: “This whole thing is suspicious. There is no proof they were mugged.” But a neighbour said he saw two cars following each other. “They stopped next to each other and the occupants started pushing each other. The second car then sped off,” he said. When the SunTeam contacted Phumeza, she said the matter had nothing to do with her, while the groom, Mzwandile Fikizolo, hung up. Police spokeswoman Captain Neldah Sekgobela said a case of robbery was opened. “The information received is that a brown VW Golf with four men stopped next to the victims and one pointed a firearm at them. The suspects found R20 000 and fled the scene.”
