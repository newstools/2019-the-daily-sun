RESIDENTS of Incwadi in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, have vowed to protest until all their demands are met. The protest started on Monday. They blockaded roads with burning tyres and tree branches. Among the things they want are RDP houses, a tarred road and access to clean water. Owen Mkhize (56) said residents had called the Msunduzi municipality several times to come and listen to their demands. “Municipal officials came and jotted down our demands. But it ended there. They’ve failed to deliver,” said Owen. Nomvula Mzoneli (42) said taxi bosses always increased fares because their vehicles were being damaged by bad roads. “We’re still without proper houses and still share water with livestock in the river,” said Nomvula. Residents said they were sometimes forced to use picks and shovels to level the road. They said they wanted to know what happened to the municipal budget for development. Councillor Thandiwe Madondo said it was true Incwadi was underdeveloped. “I don’t know what was happening in this ward as it was under Ingwe Municipality before it was demarcated to Msunduzi Municipality in August 2016.” Msunduzi municipal spokeswoman Thobeka Mafumbatha said: “There are developments such as boreholes and water tankers providing water. The housing project is in the planning phase. Residents were addressed by an official from the transport department regarding the roads. Let us be mindful they have only been with Msunduzi for three years.”
