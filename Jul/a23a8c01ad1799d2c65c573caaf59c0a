LIFE is hard for Lulama Mdingi. The 29-year-old from Philippi Browns Farm, Cape Town, is asking for help to turn his life around. Resident Nomasondo Jelele (40) claimed Lulama tried to commit suicide by setting his house on fire. “He wanted to take his own life because nothing seemed to be working out for him. “Residents managed to kill the fire and he was rescued,” said Nomasondo. Community leader Mfundo Hermanus said residents were trying to help Lulama. “But we need the public to chip in. Lulama is a young man with his whole life ahead of him,” said Mfundo “I heard about his living conditions and felt the community and South Africans should help him get his life back on track. “Many people think he’s a thug but he’s not.” But Lulama said he never tried to kill himself. He said he fell asleep while cooking. “I’m begging for help from anyone who can assist me to rebuild my house. He said his dad died many years ago and his mum had abandoned him and went to live with her boyfriend. Lulama told the SunTeam he’s unemployed and, that he survives on handouts from the community.
