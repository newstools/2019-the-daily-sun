PHILIPPI East’s new station commander, Colonel Mzwabantu, Jada joined pastors from various churches to pray for peace in Lower Crossroads. The prayer was held on Saturday near Thandi Tavern, where three people were shot and two died, and they prayed for Marikana squatter camp. Jada said: “We can’t win the battle alone. We can make our areas safe if there’s a good working relationship between churches, residents and police.” Nomabhongo Mntuyedwa (51) told Daily Sun the prayer opened wounds. “A lot of people died here. We hope the pastors will come back. We’re happy they came. We needed this.” Pastor and organiser Ntombekhaya Plati-Nyama from Genesis Faith Mission thanked her fellow pastors. “We decided to talk to God after hearing about the killings in this area,” she said. Pastor Linda Ndaba from Kingdom Life Bible Church said: “It will never be the same again as we believe every place we visit and pray for will be changed.”
