FANS of British spy movies yesterday heard that the latest James Bond could be a black woman. It is said the iconic role will be taken over by 31-year-old Lashana Lynch. The next film, Bond 25, still features Daniel Craig in the starring role but introduces Lynch’s character, Nomi. The film is set for release next year. Lashana previously appeared in films such as US and played a fighter pilot in Captain Marvel. After hearing the news, local film director Kagiso Lediga, currently filming a series called Queen Sono for Netflix, said: “Is this true? That’s great. I’m over the moon. It was about time.” Directors Salamina Mosese and Stephina Zwane, who produced and directed Baby Mama Drama, also said they were delighted. Salamina said: “It’s great to see performers of colour getting the nod from big production teams. Representation matters more today than at any other time. “We need to get used to seeing strong, fierce characters being portrayed by black women.” Stephina said the media influenced how people viewed themselves. “Telling our authentic stories is exciting and important. Being able to add our voices and work to the media landscape means we are contributing to changing views and creating a wave of much needed change,” she said.
