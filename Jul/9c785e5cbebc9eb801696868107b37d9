THE father of a pupil whose hair was allegedly shaved by a teacher wants the department to deal with the teacher. The 55-year-old father from N Section in KwaMashu, Durban, is a member of the Shembe Baptist Church. His son (13) is a grade 8 pupil at Sivananda Technical High School. He said the teacher disrespected his religion. “My son told me a teacher arrived in his class and started shaving all pupils who had long hair, without asking any questions. “My son told me he tried to explain to the teacher that he was from Shembe Church and was not allowed to shave his hair, but the teacher told him he didn’t care,” he said. The father said his son had never shaved his hair since he was born. “They asked him to shave his hair at his previous school. I told them why he couldn’t. They understood and didn’t carry on,” he said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of assault was being probed. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said a 2016 circular clearly spelt out that under no circumstances should teachers shave the hair of pupils attending the Shembe Church. Nazareth Faith Rights Abuse Watch chairman Wellington Myeni said: “The teacher and the department look down on our religion.”
