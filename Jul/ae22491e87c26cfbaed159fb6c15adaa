MAMELODI Sundowns striker Jeremy Brockie has been absent from pre-season training as he is in New Zealand attending the funeral of his grandfather. Sundowns are currently in their pre-season camp in Mpumalanga as they are pre-paring for the upcoming 2019/2020 campaign. On Friday Sundowns invited media to theuir press conference in Mpumalanga and Brockie was the notable player that was not part of the team. Sundowns' management gave the Kiwi international the time off to deal with the bereavement but he is expected to report back to Chloorkop sooner rather than later. Brockie, affectionately known as Sniper, has been linked with a move away from the Brazilians after falling out of favour under coach Pitso Mosimane. The arrival of Mauricio Affonso who has started training with the team means there is intense competition for the number nine role for the 2016 African champions. The 31-year-old Brockie has not been able to replicate his prolific form where he made his name with SuperSport United, and while he will return for pre-season in the coming days - it seems his future lies away from Downs. At this stage, it is uncertain as to which teams are interested in his services.
