THE ANC in Gauteng is not excited about the EFF’s announcement yesterday that they’re no longer supporting the DA in highly contested municipalities. READ: 'We will no longer vote with the DA, ANC in municipalities across the country' At a press conference on Tuesday, EFF leader Julius Malema announced that the party would no longer be voting with the DA. The DA got control of the mayorship in Tshwane and Joburg in the 2016 municipal elections through a coalition with smaller parties and the support of the EFF. But this relationship seems to have collapsed, leaving the DA’s control in the metros in the balance. But ANC Joburg spokesman Jolidee Matongo said they are preparing for the 2021 elections as they suspect the EFF is playing games. “We know from time to time the EFF say something and act differently. They can’t be trusted,” said Matongo. “They think because they have made this announcement we will come up with a motion of no confidence, but we won’t do that.”
