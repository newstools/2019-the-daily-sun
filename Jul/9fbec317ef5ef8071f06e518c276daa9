Bafana Bafana takes on Morocco in a do-or-die affair in the AFCON on Monday. Bafana needs a straight win against Morocco to cement their chances of progressing to the next stage of the tournament. After getting their campaign off to a rocky start against Ivory Coast (1-0 defeat), Stuart Baxter’s charges steadied the ship with a 1-0 victory over neighbours Namibia last Friday, thanks to Bongani Zungu's header. In Group D, Morocco (6 points) are in first position, Ivory Coast (3) second, Bafana Bafana (3) third and Namibia (0) anchored at the bottom. The South Africans, meanwhile, are also ranked third of best third-placed teams. Depending on the other result in the group on Monday (Ivory Coast v Namibia, also at 18:00), Bafana could seal their qualification with a win, a draw or a loss against Morocco on Monday. The People’s Paper asked SunLanders to share their messages of encouragement to Bafana ahead of the game. SunLanders had mixed feelings. Although some shared messages of encouragement and were hopeful of a Bafana win, others said they should just come back home already.
