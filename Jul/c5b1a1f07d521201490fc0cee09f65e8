COUNCILLORS from the Msunduzi Municipality in the KZN midlands have called for intervention to ensure everyone’s safety. The call came after what sounded like an explosion during a council sitting on Monday that shook the Msunduzi city hall. In the meeting Sbu Sithole, the municipality administrator, who was appointed by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs in April, was expected to present a confidential report. DA councillor Roosana Ahmed said they felt the municipality didn’t care about councillors’ safety, as well as municipal employees. “The explosion shocked us and there haven’t been any measures put in place to ensure everyone’s safety,” said Ahmed. She said rescuers only escorted Sithole and the municipal manager Nelisiwe Ngcobo out of the building, leaving 50 attendees behind. ANC councillor Xolani Ngongoma said they will continue to attend meetings even though they don’t feel safe at all. “To think the person went past security guards at the gate without being noticed is scary. KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of discharging of fireworks in a building is being investigated by Pietermaritzburg cop shop. Daily Sun has not been able to get hold of Mayor Themba Njilo since Tuesday.
