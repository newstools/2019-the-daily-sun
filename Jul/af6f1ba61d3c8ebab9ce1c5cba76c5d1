KHOKHI Nxumalo is a sickly 89-year-old gogo. But gogo, from Bhukhanana in Empangeni, northern KZN, felt free of disease after she was handed the keys to her new four-roomed house yesterday. Last month Daily Sun carried a story in which gogo Khokhi said she feared her unstable one-roomed mud house would collapse on her and her five grandkids. Yesterday gogo was all smiles as City of Umhlathuze officials handed her the house. “I feel lighter. I don’t need a walking stick to help me all day. I feel lively,” she said. She said she felt less sick until the construction of her house began last month. “I thank God and officials for seeing me through the terrible situation I was living in. I don’t know what I can say to show my gratitude,” she said. Gogo Khokhi said when construction started she would wake up at night and pinch herself, asking whether she was really getting a decent house at last. Eight other families also received new houses yesterday. Mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo said his municipality would continue to serve the interests of the people.
