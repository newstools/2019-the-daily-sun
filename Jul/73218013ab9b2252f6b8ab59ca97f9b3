FOR 30 years they never had children together and never had problems. Alexia Mcube (57) told Daily Sun she and her husband Jeffrey (60) tried for many years to have a child. They went to church together and got pastors to pray for them, but nothing helped. Jeffrey, a pastor from Lenasia, Joburg told Daily Sun he still wanted a child. “I decided to take another wife and Alexia agreed,” said Jeffrey. But Alexia, who now lives in Meyerton, said in 2014 it became unbearable for her and she left him although they are still married. Alexia claimed Jeffrey started making debt and started messing around with other women. “When I asked him about it he got angry and insulted me,” she said. Jeffrey told Daily Sun he never played around. Instead he claimed his wife made debt, using his name. He said his wife is bitter because he has another wife and because she can’t have kids. He claimed Alexia threatened his new wife and went to the people at church to convince them to remove him as a pastor. The second wife, Sibongile (48) told Daily Sun Alexia needs to leave her in peace. “Last year September I received threatening calls telling me to leave the house,” she said. She claimed she was later threatened by three men, but she never opened a case. Jeffrey’s brother Lucky (64) told Daily Sun they warned him about Alexia. “Now he’s in a mess because of her,” said Lucky. Jeffrey and the new wife have not been able to produce a child.
