COPS are urging parents to look after their kids, especially during school holidays. “Parents must supervise their kids,” said Captain Andre Beetge of the Eastern Cape police. He said many kids play in dams, trenches and rivers without supervision. “This leads to drowning and kids go missing as friends are scared to report the incidents. “When kids go swimming they must be supervised by someone who can swim. It’s a mistake to think that a 10-year-old can be trusted with a responsibility of supervising other kids,” he said. “A parent could be prosecuted for child neglect if it could be proved he or she was negligent.” He said in many cases kids just go swimming without the knowledge of their parents. Sakhumzi Stuurman (45) of Govan Mbeki said he often chased boys away from a nearby dam. “A few years ago a boy from Zwide drowned in the dam and his friends never told his parents. We only knew about it after cops intervened.”
