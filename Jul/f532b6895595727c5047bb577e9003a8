EVEN while Matlosana Local Municipality was threatening legal action, land invaders were still marking out stands. The land near Stilfontein in North West has become known as Mama Winnie Avenue. Daily Sun learnt lists were circulated in Khuma by ward committee members. Some people were added, while others were skipped. While the land grab started on vacant land owned by the public works department, it has now grown to include property owned by the municipality. Provincial cops spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said Stilfontein police were holding a formal investigation after a national member of the public works department complained about trespassing. On Monday morning, people flocked to the area along the railway line to mark out stands. Community leader and chairman of Khuma CPF Nkosinathi Makume told Daily Sun they were tired of being promised land. They heard Khuma is full of dolomite, so they settled on land in Stilfontein. “We invited councillors to our community meetings many times to address this issue but they don’t attend. “ We have even sent an invite through the Speaker’s office but nobody came,” he said. Matlosana municipal spokeswoman Ntswaki Makgetha urged illegal occupants to vacate the premises within seven days, or they would institute legal proceedings against them. Makume said: “The removal of Khuma residents from Mama Winnie Avenue will drive us to the streets and that is what we’re trying to avoid. “It will lead to a total,illegal shut down.”
