Former tourism minister Derek Hanekom has confirmed he had
met with EFF secretary general Godrich Gardee, but told News24 there was
nothing untoward about the meeting. Hanekom is the subject of allegations made by EFF leader
Julius Malema that he had handed a list of MPs to the party who would vote
against former president Jacob Zuma in a bid to oust him as head of state. Speaking to party supporters on Tuesday, Malema said
Hanekom, a national executive committee member, was ready to form a splinter
party if President Cyril Ramaphosa's rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, at the
Nasrec conference had won the race. He has, however, denied this. In a brief SMS sent to News24,
Hanekom, who refused to answer questions, said this was not true. "I have said - not admitted - that at the time I met
Gardee. His initiative, not mine. There is nothing with meeting a fellow MP,
which is what we were at the time." Hanekom resigned as an MP shortly after the general
elections. Reacting to Hanekom's statement, Gardee said there were
several meetings between the EFF, SACP leader Solly Mapaila and Hanekom. "I have nothing to say. It is confirmed that there were
several meetings with Derek and Solly Mapaila. It does not matter who initiated
it. I can't give you the juicy partâ€¦ What is important is that he has
confirmed." SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo, however, said the party
strongly condemned any suggestion that it was part of a conspiracy. "The SACP
strongly condemns any distortion or insinuation suggesting or seeking to
suggest otherwise."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hanekom-confirms-malemas-claims-of-meeting-with-eff-but-denies-conspiring-to-oust-zuma-20190724
