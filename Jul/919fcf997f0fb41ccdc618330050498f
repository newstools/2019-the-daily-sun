JOBURG mayor Herman Mashaba yesterday said not all Soweto residents should be suffering blackouts. In recent weeks areas across the kasi have been experiencing power outages, leading to a series of violent protest. This came around the same time that Eskom announced Soweto residents owed around R18 billion in unpaid electricity bills. Over the weekend, over 20 cars were stoned or torched in the Nancefield area. Eskom said the power outage was due to a faulty cable. However, Mashaba insisted Eskom was punishing all residents to force those who didn’t pay to settle their bills. In an opinion piece, Mashaba said he had no business telling Eskom what to do but he was concerned about the damage to municipal property during protests. “Among the residents affected by blackouts are paying customers who have been able to provide evidence that their accounts are fully paid,” he wrote. “Included among these paying residents are prepaid customers who have had to endure extended blackouts from two weeks to months on end. They should not be suffering this inconvenience.” Mashaba said parts of Soweto were supplied by City Power and not Eskom and these areas were not experiencing extended blackouts. Yesterday, police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said no arrests had been made in connection with the protests.
