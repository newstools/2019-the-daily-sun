THEY travelled from the dusty village in Limpopo at 4am to welcome their daughter Sho Madjozi home! As she stepped out of luggage collection at OR Tambo International Airport yesterday, she walked into the waiting arms of her mum Rosemary Phaweni, who was surrounded by her entire family and other relatives. Fans sang for her as she hugged her mother tightly. The star won a BET award in Los Angeles, US, last Monday. She won in the category of Best International New Act. Sho said she was proud that the rest of the world had recognised her work. She said there are many opportunities for young artists. “All you have to do is show up and do your best.” She said she’ll be starting film projects in her home village so that young people can also have opportunities. Rosemary said they came to celebrate her daughter’s win. “We jumped with excitement when she was named the winner.” Makhado mayor Samuel Munyai was also at the airport. He said: “Sho comes from our soil. It is our responsibility to be here so we can be part of history.” Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa said Sho was Africa’s gold. “She has shown the world that you can be anything you want to be. “She has made it to the world stage through music produced in her own language.”
