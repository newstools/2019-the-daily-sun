Local rapper Nadia Nakai is truly the queen of colourful wigs. This lady has them in every colour. Part of Nadia's unique image is her hair - her colour hair. Nadia is so brave and playful when it comes to her hair, and lucky for her, she has facial features that compliment any hairstyle she does. Hair for every woman plays a big role in her image and identity because it really says a lot about who you are and it is the first thing that people see before you even open your mouth for people to get to know you. Nadia has really used her hair to showcase a bit of her bubbly, loud, energetic personality through her hair. She often always wears wigs. Wigs are a great way to switch up your style if you are like Nadia who wants to change up the style of your hair frequently. See pictures below of some of Nadia's beautiful hairstyles for some hair inspiration. New vaaaaaaarb!
