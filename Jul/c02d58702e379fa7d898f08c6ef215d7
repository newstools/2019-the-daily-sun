A WALL that was badly damaged by a speeding car has finally been fixed. But it took a story in Daily Sun in June to make things happen. The wall outside a house in KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, was damaged by a VW Jetta after the driver lost control of the car. The Jetta swung off the road, jumped onto the pavement, and crashed into the wall. The car was going so fast it almost destroyed the house and the cars that were parked in the yard. Following the accident, the house owners have been waiting for the driver to fix their wall. A family member said parents of the driver, who’s from nearby Newlands West, finally fixed the wall on Saturday. “The driver was very young. I’m glad his parents came through for him. “Some people don’t come back to take care of the damage. I believe writing about it in the newspaper helped. We thank Daily Sun for the help,” he said.
