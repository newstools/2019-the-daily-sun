THE University of the Free State hosted 200 top performing matrics for a school camp this week. The camp was organised by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants. Godfrey Legwale, the institute’s project manager, said: “The purpose of the camp is to enhance the scarce skills of our black African pupils, to push them into careers such as engineering, accountancy and medicine. “There are 200 grade 12 pupils here who’re top performers. “We teach them maths, science and accounting. Beyond that, we also help them with life skills to prepare them for university.” Legwale said they also helped pupils apply for bursaries. “Their parents don’t have money or access to funding, as most of them come from poor backgrounds. “Helping them apply for bursaries is one of the things the University of the Free State is assisting us with. “We want to thank the provincial education department for working with us.” He said since pupils found out there were many opportunities on offer, their mindsets had changed. “Some of them come from rural areas, and they are not exposed to these things,” he said. Zukisa Bangela (18), a pupil at Leseding Technical Secondary School in Welkom, said she was happy to be chosen for the camp. “We’re taught to be disciplined and to work hard. “I’m here to improve in electrical technology, a subject that’s a challenge for me.”
