SIX concerned residents of Mamelodi, Tshwane, applied for RDP houses in 2009. They said municipal officials always tell them their applications are still being processed. Sanie Sebulela (61) told Daily Sun, “We are tired of visiting municipal offices only to return empty-handed.” The residents also complained that people who applied at the same time as them and those who applied before them had houses, but they don’t. Nthabiseng Pule (51) said what they are going through is painful. “We suspect our houses were given to other people in Mamelodi East. We want our houses and don’t want to invade land and newly built RDP houses in extension 21 and 22 in Mamelodi east,” she said. The residents visited the municipal offices in the Tshwane CBD and were told their names appeared on the system, but should go back to Mamelodi municipality offices. City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said their records confirmed the listed complainants are indeed registered in the housing demand database, as well as the years they have been on the waiting list. “There are no subsidies approved on their names yet because recent housing projects in the region were targeted to reduce the backlog from 1996 to 1999. “We apologise for the delay in the provision of their subsidies,” he said.
