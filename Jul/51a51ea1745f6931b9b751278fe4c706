LIMPOPO Education MEC Polly Boshielo is threatening to approach the high court for an urgent interdict against Zebediela residents who closed down seven schools. The community, which is demanding a tar road in their area, closed schools for three months. Boshielo and MEC for Transport and Community Safety Dickson Masemola visited the area on Tuesday, but residents refused to back down. “What makes me angry is that the same community burned a library at Mmalemati Primary School. Who really burns a library? What a sad day. The community of Zebediela decided that pupils will not go to school until they receive a letter about the construction of the road,” said Boshielo. She said they were saddened by residents’ actions. “We are left with no option but to approach the high court for an urgent interdict. We are busy briefing state attorneys and are ready to protect the rights of the pupils. Seven schools missed their teaching and learning as a result of the community protesting for a tar road.” Masemola added that they wanted to see stability return to the area and that pupils should be allowed to continue learning. Community leader Sophy Legong said they would not back down until four community members who were arrested were released. She said they would have stopped if government had listened and acted.
