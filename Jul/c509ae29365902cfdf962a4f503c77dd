SOON, Sizwe Mkhize will be sleeping peacefully once more! This is after inyanga Mambeluhlaza Magwaza forgave him for stealing R7 000 from his indumba in Mariannhill, west of Durban, KZN, last month. Sizwe told Daily Sun last week that after he stole the money, he was unable to sleep because it felt as if he was being choked by zombies. He said the zombies demanded that he return the money. INYANGA ZOMBIE REVENGE! Magwaza said he forgave Sizwe because although he was an inyanga, he was a spiritual person and a church member. “I consulted my ancestors and they told me that in order for the zombies to leave him alone, he must get R200 worth of R1 coins, wrap them in a white cloth and throw them into the sea at night,” said Magwaza. He said it made him angry that Sizwe had stolen the money. “I only saw the money was gone from the indumba after he left. I asked everyone at home if they had taken the money, but they all said no. I called Sizwe and he denied taking the money. So I went back to the ancestors to deal with the thief,” he said. “I hope he has learnt his lesson.” Sizwe said he’s grateful that Magwaza has given him an easy task. “I’ll do as he says so that I can get my life back.” He had told Daily Sun he used the money for his basic needs. His brother, Nkosinathi (41) said: “The family is happy that he is forgiven. We will make sure that we help him do what Magwaza told him to do.”
