SAM Meyiwa
has passed on without getting justice for his beloved son Senzo Meyiya. He was wheelchair bound and his speech was affected after
he suffered a stroke in August 2018. Senzo died
in 2014 after being shot in Kelly Khumalo’s mother’s house in Vosloorus, in
Ekurhuleni. In 2017, Sam Meyiwa told Daily Sun that the failure of the police to arrest any suspects left him with many questions. While in August
2018, the Meyiwa family was devastated when there was a report released reportedly
stating that the case had been closed. However,
Police Minister Bheki Cele assured the family that he had not given up
on finding Senzo’s killers. Cele then introduced
a new team of investigators and said over 100 former investigators were removed
and replaced with new members.  Following Snezo's death, there were allegations that veteran music
producer Chicco Twala’s gun had disappeared around the time of the incident, which
raised suspicions about him and his son’s involvement in the murder.  Twala’s son,
Longwe’s story was that he managed to run outside the house after armed robbers
stormed into the house. Meanwhile, Zandie
who is Kelly Khumalo’s sister who was in the house when the incident happened
said at the time: “While we were eating‚ people stormed into the house. They
immediately demanded cell phones and money. When they said this‚ I took my
phone and hid it under the pillow on the sofa. “Longwe
then stood up pushed one of the men and forced his way out.”
