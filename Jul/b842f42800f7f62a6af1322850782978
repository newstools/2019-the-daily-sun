DJ TIRA is not Chilli M’s best DJ. “I just don’t like the guy!” the radio legend told MacG in a podcast posted on YouTube last Thursday. Chilli M, whose real name is Vukani Masinga and is known as Daddy, said Afrotainment boss Tira dumps artists when they no longer are relevant. “Tira will always work with you when you’re flavour of the month,” he said. “What happened to C’ndo? When last did she release a track? “When last did you hear of Fisherman and NaakMusiq?” Chilli M, who worked with Tira on the song Udaddy Usebenzile, was axed by Ukhozi FM after he admitted taking a bribe from an aspiring kwaito group. He also revealed his 4-5 doesn’t rise anymore. He told MacG: “Ay, there’s no one at home.” Asked MacG: Are you being serious? Ayisavuki?” Chilli M replied: “I can’t get a hard-on when I don’t have money. Money turns me on.” Called for comment, DJ C’ndo said: “I didn’t see the interview. I can’t comment.” DJ Fishermansaid he’s not allowed to comment on anything about Afrotainment and Tira. “If Chilli M thinks I was used, it’s okay,” he said. Tira said: “There’s this thing hanging over my head that I’m responsible for everyone I’ve worked with. “If someone’s not making music, who’re they going to blame? “I’ve been discovering talent and helping people along the way and keep it moving.” Chilli M wasn’t available for comment.
