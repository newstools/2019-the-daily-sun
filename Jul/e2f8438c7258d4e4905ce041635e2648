Billions have already been paid out in tax refunds. The South African Revenue Service has confirmed that it has
already paid out R3.5 billion in refunds during this tax season. These monies were paid to eFilers and users of the SARS
MobiApp since the beginning of the month. “During the first week of July, R1.5 billion in refunds were
validated and released,” said SARS in a statement. The tax filing season opened earlier for users of eFiling
and the MobiApp. According to SARS, this is to allow a speedier and
convenient filing experience without the need to queue at a branch. It offers a digital support and services such as
Help-You-eFilers that connects the taxpayer to a tax agent for further guidance
on eFiling, also the call-back functionality on MobiApp and the Chat-Bot that
provide real-time answers to specific questions. With less than two weeks before branch filing opens,
taxpayers are encouraged to beat the queues and file their returns on the
MobiApp and eFiling. “Their claim will be attended to and resolved swiftly, if it
is not flagged for audit. Even after the opening of branch filing season on 1
August, we encourage taxpayers to use the MobiApp and eFiling for a faster and
efficient service,” said SARS. The Revenue Service said once a tax return is assessed and a
refund is due, it will take an average of seven days to be paid out. However,
this is only possible if there is no outstanding debt as well as audit. “To avoid delays, taxpayers are urged to respond to requests
for supporting documents and confirmation of banking details.  These are validations that SARS must adhere
to. Taxpayers are also requested to ensure that third-party data from their
service providers is correct and where such information is incorrect, it be
raised with their service provider for re-submission,” it added.
