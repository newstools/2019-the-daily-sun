Cape
Town's Metro Police arrested a suspected chicken thief on Thursday morning.  "At
around 9am, officers on patrol in Woodlands, Mitchells Plain, noticed two men
walking down the road, pushing a shopping trolley.  "The
goods in the trolley had been covered with clothing, piquing the officers'
interest," Sergeant Ruth Solomons said in a statement on Thursday.  When
the police stopped the pair to inspect what was in the trolley, they fled.  One
managed to flee, while the other was caught.  "When
officers searched the trolley, they found 30 bags of chicken [3kg each] and six
bags of potato chips [5kg each]. The goods were valued at around R3 000,"
Solomons said.  The
police later found out that the goods had been stolen from a fast-food outlet
in Westgate Mall.  The
26-year-old suspect is being detained at Lentegeur police station.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/pics-chicken-thief-falls-foul-of-the-law-in-cape-town-while-accomplice-wings-it-from-scene-20190704
