GOGO Nomasikizi Vunywa was overjoyed after receiving donations from SunReaders. The People’s Paper last week published a story about how her grandchild was forced to take care of her. Yolisa Mpokela, who teaches one of the gogo’s grandkids, decided to help. She realised the gogo was struggling after the grandchild missed school. “I was just relaxing when the teacher came with people who brought me food and crutches,” said the 79-year-old from Crossroads in Cape Town. When the SunTeam visited her last week, her house had no carpet, proper bed or cupboard. “I’m grateful to everyone who donated these things. I never imagined people would do this for someone they don’t even know,” said the gogo. Yolisa said: “When I first posted on Facebook asking for donations, I wasn’t sure if people would respond.” Her colleague Khululwa Gom-Mavundla said: “This turned out beautifully. Even pupils have been bringing donations for other less fortunate kids.” Yolisa thanked Daily Sun for making sure more people pitched in to help the family.
