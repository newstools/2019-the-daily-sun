FORMER troubled Cape Town City striker Tokelo Rantie is reportedly returning to fitness and could sign a deal with Mamelodi Sundowns. Rantie returned from a failed spell in Turkey with Genclerbirligi in 2018/19 with City but had not played much first-team football as he was out of shape. The player was also said to be experiencing lifestyle issues off the pitch and as such never made an official appearance for the Citizens. He was released at the end of the last campaign but in pre-season started training with the Brazilians and by all indications he is close to getting back to his best. A source at Sundowns says the 28-year-old has impressed coach Pitso Mosimane and a deal may be in the offing in the near future. The source said: "He has done well. The hunger is there. TK wants to play football. "It looks like Sundowns are happy with him so far and a decision is expected to be taken very soon." If Rantie does put pen to paper, he will join fellow new attacker Mauricio Affonso in Mosimane's forward line. -SPORT24
