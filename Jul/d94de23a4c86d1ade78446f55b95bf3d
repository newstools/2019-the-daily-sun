BEYONCE has revealed the tracklisting for the Lion King soundtrack and Mzansi’s stars Busiswa and Moonchild Sanelly are featured alongside the megastar. The new age remake of the classic animated film will be released this Friday and it is not just super producer Lebo M and veteran actor John Kani who are representing Mzansi . The two artists have managed to keep this huge achievement a secret with Busiswa only tweeting about Beyonce’ after the amazing news hit the internet.   Busiswa and Moonchild join Beyonce’, US rapper Tierra Whack and Nigerian afropop star Yemi Alade on a song called ‘My Power’. Beyoncé’ is the executive producer of The Lion King :The Gift  Beyoncé’s which she calls her “love letter to Africa.” In December, Beyonce’ posted a  video collage of her Global Citizen performance with hubby Jay-Z and used Moonchild Sanelly’s vocals on the hit dance song ‘Nay’Le Walk’. After settling in at home from a beautiful trip to South Africa and India, I am still in awe that 7.1 BILLION dollars was raised to aid Global Citizen in its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. I’d like to give my praise and respect to all the speakers, performers, and volunteers who donated their time to contribute to making positive change. Every person in the audience at FNB Stadium earned a seat because they generously donated their time to help their community. Now their efforts and the money raised will help improve education, healthcare, sanitation, women’s rights, and countless other causes for millions across the globe. I felt so much positivity and pride in the audience at Global Citizen: Mandela 100. Madiba, Johannesburg, and all of my African sisters and brothers, we hope we made you as proud as you all make us. South Africa was an extraordinary trip for me and my family. God bless.
