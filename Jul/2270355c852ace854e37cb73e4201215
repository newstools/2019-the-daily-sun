THREE suspects were fatally wounded and in a shootout between a group of armed robbers in Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga on Monday morning. Cops responded to a Cash-In-Transit heist in progress at a Post Office in Bushbuckridge. The group of armed robbers were found busy off-loading money from the Fidelity cash van outside the Post Office, where they had held the security officers hostage. The multidisciplinary team interrupted them leading to a high-speed chase which led to a shootout. An unknown number of suspects fled the scene in a Toyota Hilux and a silver Mercedes Benz after they forcefully stopped passer-byâ€™s and thereafter hijacked them. The Toyota Hilux was later on recovered. Cops say this was a joint crime intelligence driven operation, including the SAPS Limpopo Tracking Teams, Mpumalanga Tracking Teams and Bushbuckridge Tactical Response Teams.
