BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis has lived by her promise of bringing back players who have been injured, and those who haven’t played much in the national team setup. Banyana, who took part in the World Cup last month, will be looking at defending their Cosafa Women’s Championship for the second time in Port Elizabeth, from 31 July to 11 August. Yesterday, Ellis announced a squad of 20 players who will represent Mzansi at the tournament. In the squad, there’s no overseas based player as the competition does not fall on the Fifa Calendar. With that, Ellis has injected new fresh blood in the likes of Priscilla Pesa, Shange Sthembile and Noxolo Cesane, who will all be making their debut in Banyana jersey. Hilda Magaia, who last played for Banyana in January this year, has been recalled, as well as Robyn Moodaly of JVW FC. Moodaly was last in the Banyana squad during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil. SunSport caught up with Magaia who just returned from Napoli, Italy, where she was part of the 30th University Sport South Africa (USSA) World Cup Student Games. After missing out in the World Cup, the 24-year-old aims to use the Cosafa to earn back her place in the team as she is eyeing Olympic games next year. “To be back in the team means a lot for me. “In January I was in the team but I couldn’t make the final team due to injuries and now the ball is in my court. It is up to me if I take this opportunity and retain my spot in the team,” said Magaia. Banyana are in Group A alongside Comoros Islands, Malawi and Madagascar.
