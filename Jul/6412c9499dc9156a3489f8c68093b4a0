MARKS Maponyane has paid tribute to former teammate Marc Batchelor who was gunned down Mafia style on Monday night. Batchelor was driving with his gardener when he was attacked by two men who were on motorbikes and was shot through the window for several times - he died at the scene. The big, imposing striker played for Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns, Moroka Swallows and SuperSport United in a career that lasted for over a decade. He was part of the Pirates team that lifted the Caf Champions League trophy in 1995 when they defeated Asec Mimosas of Ivory Coast against all odds. Batchelor was known for his no-nonsense attitude and a winning mentality that knew no bounds. “We formed a very good partnership on the field and we played to our strengths. Competition to start matches was fierce because we also had Jerry Sikhosana and Bruce Ramokadi fighting to be in the first eleven,” said Maponyane. “I called him Big Batch and I remember the winning goal he scored against Chiefs after I supplied the cross. I think it was around 1993-1994. We were also together when we won the league title with Pirates in 1994, hence we went on to play in the Caf Champions League the following year. “I spent most time with him on the pitch. I did not know much about his current lifestyle. I hadn’t seen him in a long time because we did not hang out in common places with other players like Edward “MaGents” Motale. I saw him at conferences and functions now and then and also on television. “To his family and friends I would like to say that may they remain strong. Their loss is our loss and I never want to hear about the death of a person I know so well. We shared a room at camp and I know he was a great person and we built a good team spirit. May he Rest In Peace!”
