COPS have arrested the mum of a two-month-old baby dumped in Verulam, north of Durban, last Friday. The 21-year-old woman was bust in Zwelisha, outside Verulam, on Sunday and is facing a charge of child abandonment. The baby was dumped along a pathway at the foot of a staircase outside a Verulam restaurant. The mum was arrested by members of Reaction Unit South Africa and handed over to the police, according to the unit’s spokesman, Prem Balram. He said after receiving the information, his unit’s officers staked out a house in Zwelisha throughout Saturday and Sunday. “They located the woman and arrested her in the presence of her father and sister as she was about to board a taxi outside their home,” said Balram. He said the woman confirmed during questioning that she had indeed abandoned her baby. “She said the father of the child was a taxi driver who failed to provide any financial support for the baby, resulting in her actions,” said Balram. Balram said the child was in good health and was being cared for at a provincial hospital. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the arrest and said the young mum would appear in the Verulam Magistrates Court soon.
