THE ANC has shot down claims there are forces hell-bent on removing President Cyril Ramaphosa as party leader when it holds its national general council meeting next year. The party said such discussions did not take place at its national executive committee meeting at the weekend. It said Ramaphosa also did not raise the issue in his political overview. At a press conference at the party’s headquarters, Luthuli House, yesterday, ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said the general council could not be used to unseat a leader. “There was no mention in the president’s opening remarks about him being unseated in the NGC. I can’t remember that and I never left the meeting. “There’s no desire to unseat the president nor is the ANC intending to remove the president,” said Duarte. Despite the public spat that played out ahead of the NEC meeting, secretary-general Ace Magashule said the meeting spent a considerable amount of time discussing the renewal and unity of the party. “The NEC recognised that there is certain persistent behaviour, particularly at leadership levels, that undermines this programme. “These include factionalism, untested and wild accusations, use of social media to attack each other, policy positions of the ANC, leaks to the media and taking the organisation to court without first exhausting internal processes,” he said. Magashule said the matter involving Derek Hanekom, who has admitted to meeting with the EFF to unseat former president Jacob Zuma, had been referred to the top six. He argued this was not a deviation of normal process as all matters raised in the NEC are taken to the top six officials.
