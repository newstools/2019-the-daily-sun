COPS conducted a stop-and-search operation in Kagiso on the West Rand on Tuesday. This follows the hijacking of delivery vans and trucks in the area recently. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said a 33-year-old suspect was arrested during the operation. He was bust at Tshepisong’s Dulcie September Street for unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. “Members were conducting stop and searches when they spotted the suspect’s minibus taxi failing to stop at stop signs and driving recklessly. “The police pulled the taxi aside and searched the vehicle and the driver, who was allegedly intoxicated.” He said police seized a 9mm police issue firearm with filed off serial numbers and ammunition. “A case of unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition was opened at Kagiso Police Station and the suspect was formally charged,” he said. Sibiya said the suspect was expected to appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court soon.
