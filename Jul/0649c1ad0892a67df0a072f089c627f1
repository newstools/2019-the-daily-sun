PATIENTS and staff at Dora Nginza Hospital have been desperate for more beds and staff. Apparently, the poor conditions at the Port Elizabeth hospital were causing tensions between staff and patients, with staff blaming management. One staff member said: “On Sunday night, there were about 50 patients and only 34 beds. There were six stretchers with C-section patients and other patients were sitting on chairs with their babies.” He told the SunTeam the nurses ended up being victimised by frustrated patients. “A few months ago a mum who had just given birth attacked a nurse. “Nurses are insulted and when they complain to management, they aren’t taken seriously.” A patient (35) said when people went to the hospital, they feared dying or losing their babies. “We are in pain but are forced to sleep on chairs and stretchers,” she said. Eastern Cape Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said there was a problem with the overflow of patients in the labour ward. “We have made an overflow area downstairs and there was a meeting with labour last week and another meeting this weekend. “This month, we appointed six more nurses. I will ask for an updated report before the end of the week.”
