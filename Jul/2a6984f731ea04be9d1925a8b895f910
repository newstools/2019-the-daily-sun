Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has revealed when fans can expect to see goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune back in action. Khune missed Saturday’s Carling Black Label Cup clash against arch rivals Orlando Pirates after failing to recover from his shoulder injury in time for the match. After the match, Middendorp revealed that the 32-year would be back in action next month. He could not, however, confirm whether Khune would be fit to face Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium (3pm) on Sunday in their first match of the season. “We have been very clear‚ and the medical side confirmed it two days ago‚ that Itu Khune will definitely be available for selection in August‚” said Middendorp. “We have to look now how far from the training side he is and where we can bring him into the area where he feels comfortable. We have to prepare. “And this is a decision along with an experienced goalkeeper at this level‚ and in cooperation with goalkeeper-coach Lee Baxter. "We have to decide, will he be available in two weeks‚ three weeks? “But definitely I’m quite sure it looks very good. I was very impressed with his outstanding contribution during our preseason camp – on the field‚ off the field.”
