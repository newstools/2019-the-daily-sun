THE family of gogo Sara Hulumeni said they had more questions than answers about how she died. The 66-year-old and another woman, Esther Mudziwa, were attacked in Ha-Mashau, outside Vuwani, Limpopo, on Friday, in a case of alleged mob justice. They were accused of being involved in the disappearance of a 12-year-old boy whose body was found floating in a river last month. After killing the two women, the mob burned down a 79-year-old man’s house. Gogo Sara’s daughter Rolivhuwa said she was relaxing at a house opposite theirs at about 8pm when she noticed a mob at the gate. “One of them went inside and burned our house. They then accused my mum of being involved in the death of the boy. They took her away and killed her. My mother was a peaceful person,” she said. She said one of the attackers also manhandled her. Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo: “On Saturday afternoon, two suspects, aged 16 and 17, were arrested. More arrests are expected.” “Anyone with information should contact detective Warrant Officer Mudogwa Mutshutshu on 072 107 6731 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.”
