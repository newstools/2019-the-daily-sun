Police have launched a manhunt for three suspects after a man who
had just withdrawn money from a bank was followed, then robbed and murdered in
Ga-Rankuwa, north of Pretoria. Police spokesperson Captain Matthews Nkoadi said the 47-year-old
victim had withdrawn R40 000 from a bank at the Ga-Rankuwa Shopping Complex in
Zone 4 on Friday and was subsequently followed by three men driving a white
Volvo sedan. The suspects later robbed the victim before shooting and killing
him. Nkoadi said this was a worrying trend that had emerged in
Ga-Rankuwa and surrounds where people are followed from the bank and then robbed. This type of crime with the same modus operandi had taken place
several times in the past month, he said. "The police in Tshwane District have noted with concern the
recent increase in bank-following robberies, where unsuspecting victims are
followed from banks after withdrawing large sums of money," Nkoadi said. The suspects are still at large.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-followed-from-bank-robbed-and-then-shot-dead-20190729
