THEY once dazzled and mesmerised the crowds in the PSLâ€¦ But now some players are finding increasingly difficult to attract the interest of teams in the money-spinning Absa Premiership. Leading the way to the National First Division trenches in the current off-season is former Bafana Bafana striker Moeketsi Sekola, who ditched Highlands Park for the nouveau rich Royal Eagles. The offer is understood to be sweeter than what some of the PSL sides can put on the table. At 34, Eleazar Rodgers is in the twilight of his career and a drop down to the lower division may not be viewed as a bad move as it is certainly better than to warm benches in the PSL. And he is sure feeling right at home, playing for hometown club, Ajax Cape Town. The others who have signed with the NFD clubs are Siyabonga Vilane, who has switched from Baroka to Richards Bay, where he was recently joined by former Chippa United midfielder, Zephania Mbokoma. More players can be expected to find homes in the first division trenches.
