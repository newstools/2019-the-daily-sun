Dear MizzB I’M a 23-year-old woman and my life is a mess. My parents died when I was a teenager and I’ve been living with my gogo. Two years ago I dated a great guy.  I fell pregnant and we agreed I should abort. The nurse who helped us told someone in my neighbourhood. Now people are talking about what I did. What’s even worse is that my boyfriend has dumped me.  I regret my choice. )  Girl Hey Girl Termination of pregnancy is much more challenging on a woman. It brings with it fear that they have violated themselves and the beliefs of others.   It’s important to get help. You should speak to a professional. Avoid isolating yourself as this gives rise to negative thoughts and feelings.
