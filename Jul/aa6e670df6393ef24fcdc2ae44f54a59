BONGANI Nkosi (34) didn’t know he was dead until his car finance application was declined in October 2016. Home Affairs officials said he shares his ID with someone from Elukwatini who had died. Bongani from Balfour in Mpumalanga said officials told him to apply for another ID, and he’s tried five times. “Officials always tell me they’re waiting for head office.” He said officials even came to interview his parents, gogo and his old school, but they still couldn’t issue him an ID. “I got injured and my compensation money couldn’t be processed.” Bongani said he needed certified copies of both his parents’ IDs before he could do anything. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said a manager in Mpumalanga will call Bongani.
