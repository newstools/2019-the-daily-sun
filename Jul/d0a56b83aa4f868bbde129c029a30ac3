THE death of Constable Nokuthula Masimula has left her family with many questions. The 39-year-old cop at Dobsonville Police Station, Soweto, was killed at a colleague’s funeral in Braamfischerville on Saturday. The incident happened when a 50-year-old man allegedly randomly started firing shots. Nokuthula’s uncle Jabu Mkhize (41) said it didn’t make sense for someone to behave like that at a cop’s funeral. “I hope to talk to people close to her to get more information on how this happened,” he said. Jabu said the news of Nokuthula’s death came as a shock to her family. “She was a breadwinner and leaves behind a huge gap in the family,” he said. Jabu said at the time of her death, Nokuthula was preparing to move out of the house she bought for her mum to live on her own. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed that a case of murder was opened. The suspect has been arrested and he appeared in court on Monday. He has been kept in jail until his next court appearance.
