EGYPT superstar Mohamed Salah could miss the Africa Cup of Nations last 16 tie against Bafana Bafana due to illness. Salah sat out of practice on Thursday with a cold and it is unclear whether he will be passed fit to face South Africa on Saturday in Cairo International Stadium at 9pm. According to Egyptian news provider Kingfut, the forward is a doubt for the encounter which will come as good news for coach Stuart Baxter and his team. The 27-year-old is a world-class performer having hit 71 goals in 104 appearances for Liverpool over two seasons. In addition, the Nagrig-born player has two goals in three matches at AFCON and is most certainly a threat if he was to feature against South Africa. Bafana defender Sifiso Hlanti says he does not fear facing Egypt's Mo Salah in Saturday's last-16 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tie.Hlanti is regarded as Bafana's first choice left back under coach Stuart Baxter but has struggled in the competition along with compatriot Thamsanqa Mkhize at right-back. The Bidvest Wits defender says he is unafraid of the superstar: "There is nothing we are afraid of. We also have good players."If we can switch on as players and take things in a positive manner with the right attitude, we can make things happen against Egypt. So we are not going to give them too much respect.He added: "I have a feeling that we can make things happen, not only for us but for the county, as they have been waiting for something to happen."
