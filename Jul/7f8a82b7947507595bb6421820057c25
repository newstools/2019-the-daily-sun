THE final line-ups for the 2019 Carling Black Label Cup have been announced. The Soweto giants meet for the eighth time in the Black Label Cup since it started in 2011, with Kaizer Chiefs looking to draw level with rivals Orlando Pirates who have won the pre-season game on four previous occasions. Last year there was no Black Label Cup due to the Fifa World Cup, but itâ€™s back and supporters have been voting to see their favourite players in the starting line-up. Both clubs lost the goalkeepers who were certain to start, having received many votes. Itumeleng Khune was ruled out for Amakhosi, while Brilliant Khuzwayo was withdrawn this week from Bucs post. Chiefs Bruce Bvuma, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Daniel Cardoso, Eric Mathoho, Lorenzo Gordinho, George Maluleka, Siphelele Ntshangase, Dumisani Zuma, Khama Billiat, Bernard Parker, Lazarous Kambole Pirates Wayne Sandilands, Mthokozisi Dube, Happy Jele, Justice Chabalala, Innocent Maela, Thembinkosi Lorch, Vincent Pule, Ben Motshwari, Luvuyo Memela, Augustine Mulenga, Justin Shonga.
