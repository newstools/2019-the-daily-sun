PROCEEDINGS at the Zondo Commission were brought to a halt yesterday. This was after Jacob Zuma’s lawyers claimed the former president had been asked to appear before the commission, headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, under false pretences. Zuma was supposed to respond to allegations by former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan that he had interfered in the appointment of Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama. “I have already answered but still I’m being taken through paragraph by paragraph of statements of officials,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen when I say I don’t know or I don’t remember.” Zuma’s advocate, Muzi Sikhakhane, said his client was being cross-examined. “We ask for an adjournment so we can advise him and he can decide whether he wants to continue,” Sikhakhane said. After an adjournment, Zondo told the commission both legal teams had agreed that the commission’s legal teams must meet Zuma. “I’m hopeful that a compromise will be found,” said Zondo. The proceedings were postponed until tomorrow. Zuma has until this point spent most of the time denying everything put to him. He also denied his term in office was riddled with factionalism. Zuma said it was impossible for him to appoint only people from his circle because the deployment committee was made up of people with different views. Zuma denied Hogan’s allegations that he wanted Gama appointed to Transnet although he was facing serious charges. “I think there were murmurs about victimisation. I can’t remember the details,” he said. Hogan’s evidence was that she was shocked and disappointed when Zuma informed her that Gama must be appointed. “I don’t remember myself saying these things,” said Zuma.
