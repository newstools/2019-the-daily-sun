THE two thugs could have gotten away with their crime but their greed got them bust. They were part of a gang which broke into a store at Sky City Mall, in Kliprivier, on Sunday. When their friends ran out, the two thugs decided to stay behind and get more cash. They made their way into the vault and started grabbing as much cash as they could. But a quick-thinking store employee ruined their plan by locking them inside the vault. The thugs allegedly shot at the vault door, but it was too strong for the bullets. Gauteng police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini told Daily Sun the thugs were found inside the vault with stolen cash. “The police also recovered a firearm, which they allegedly used to shoot the vault door while trapped inside,” he said. He said the two suspects were part of a gang of more than five armed robbers who tried to rob the mall. “Other gang members fled in a getaway vehicle, leaving their two accomplices behind,” he said. Dlamini said the suspects will be charged with attempted murder, business robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. The suspects will appear in the Veereneging Magistrates Court today.
