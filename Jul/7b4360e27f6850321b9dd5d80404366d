MASKANDI singer Velo wants to take the music industry by storm. The 25-year-old from Nquthu in KZN has spent hours in studio trying to perfect his craft. He’s also done research about the industry and has taught himself everything he needs to know to have a successful career. The up-and-coming artist, whose real name’s Velokuhle Msimango, said he fell in love with maskandi at the age of 10. However, he only started recording music when he was 18 years old. Speaking to SunBuzz, he said: “At home my family used to play maskandi and I would sing along as it’s something I woke up to on weekends.” The artist said he also took his time when it came to recording as he wanted to give people good music. Velo released a single titled Kancane Kancane in February. He said the song is about working hard and waiting patiently on God to deliver his blessings. The singer said maskandi music is the only genre he does well. “I was inspired by the late legendary Khulekani “Mgqumeni” Khumalo. He really knew how to make good music. “I love the fact that his music had a message and his style was different.” Velo said he enjoys performing in front of large crowds. He said this helped him grow his fan base and his music profile as an artist. “I’m trying to adopt the kwaito style and use it in maskandi. “I think that can show young people that maskandi’s not only for elderly people,” said Velo. He told SunBuzz his wish is to work with rapper Sjava. “He makes great music and people follow him a lot. I get inspired when I see him getting awards. I wish one day it will be me,” said Velo.
