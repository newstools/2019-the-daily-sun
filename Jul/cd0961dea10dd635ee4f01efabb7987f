DEPUTY chief justice Raymond Zondo said he was disappointed cops didn’t take action over death threats made to Vrede dairy farm project beneficiaries. This was after Makhosini Dhlamini told the state capture commission chairman he was living in fear as people wanted to kill him. He said there was a video recording of two men discussing killing him and Mpaleni Ncongwane, another farmer. He said two other beneficiaries had been killed already. “They say we must be killed because we are making other beneficiaries aware of their rights.” Dhlamini said he handed over the video to a Hawks investigator called Ntombela last month and later showed it to the commander of Vrede Police Station. “All he said was that he would call me and I should protect myself.” Dhlamini said the video was played at a community hall during Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s visit to the area. She visited Vrede months after releasing a report that didn’t include views of beneficiaries. Dhlamini said: “I appeal to authorities that the Vrede project must be dealt with and finalised. People are living in fear. “If the government wishes to shut it down, so be it. It is clear that it was not meant for us but thieves.” Zondo said: “It would be necessary for the commission to find out from the Hawks what they have done about Dhlamini’s complaint.”
