MAGENTS Motale has escaped death! The former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana star was involved in a serious car accident on the N1 South highway on Sunday afternoon. He admits that he is lucky to be alive today considering the damage on his BMW 3 series, popularly known in townships as a G-String. He was driving alone on the N1, just before the Delmas off-ramp when his blue Beemer bust a back tyre and span on the highway. He said the spinning car was stopped by highway embankments. "I tried everything to control and safely stop the car, but it all happened so fast," Motale, who was SuperSportTV's sport analyst, told Daily Sun yesterday from his home in Atteridgeville, Pretoria on Monday morning. He said he was helped by passersby who stopped in the middle of the road, around 3pm on Sunday, and they pulled him out of the car. The car caught fire and one of the good Samaritans used his fire extinguisher to stop the fire on the car which started on the bottom back of the car. "I was panicking big time. I thought it will explode and hurt us," he explains. "Had the car not hit the pavement, I think the damage would have been better. And I was not driving at high speed." As a committed soccer man, Motale was on his way to Alexandra for the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games. "I am happy and thankful that I escaped the whole accident unharmed," he said. Just last month that very car was burgled into in Marabastad in Pretoria where car parts were stolen. "This is now worrying me. And there is nothing that I can do as I am no longer working. My contract with SuperSport was not renewed and I don't have insurance at this stage."
