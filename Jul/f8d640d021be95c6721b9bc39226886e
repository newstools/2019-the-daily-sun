CARLING Black Label Cup Champion Coach search reached a new level when hopeful Xolisa Njobi showed off his other talents. The lad from the East London could be mistaken for Idols contestant when he belted out a song during the Champion Coach selection process on Saturday at the FNB Stadium. The list was whittled down to four on Saturday and the winning coaches, who will coach Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday, will be unveiled on Soccer Zone on Monday night. See the video of Njobi and tell us if you think he can coach as good as he can sing.
