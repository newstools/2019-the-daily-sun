PROBLEMS with refuse collection in Umlazi, south of Durban, are still unresolved, despite the premier’s intervention. Uncollected rubbish is still piling up in many parts of the kasi. Premier Sihle Zikalala visited the area earlier this month and promised the matter would be resolved within days, but residents who spoke to Daily Sun said nothing much has changed. Residents said the eThekwini municipal trucks came once, but they left for good after they were attacked by striking workers. Mbongiseni Dlamini (55) from F section said the rubbish brings flies and maggots. He said they decided to burn the rubbish while waiting for the municipality to find a solution. “It seems even the premier is failing to end this problem. He promised striking workers will be paid within a week, but we are still sitting with refuse in our wards.” Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said acting mayor Fawzia Peer was working hard to find a lasting solution. He said refuse collectors’ jobs have been advertised and officials have been asked to speed up the employment process. “We appeal to the people of Umlazi to be patient. We feel a lasting solution lies with this employment process as we believe most of the striking workers will be included as they have experience.” He said refuse collection was halted in Umlazi because of issues between contractors and workers.
