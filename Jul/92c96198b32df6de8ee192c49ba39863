A schizophrenic man accused of killing his mum allegedly told relatives that US rap superstar Nicki Minaj picked up his elderly mum and they went on a road trip to Kimberley. Today the lawyer for murder suspect Shakoor Roberts asked for access to a voice recording of his client allegedly confessing to murdering his mother, Gafsa Roberts, (61), reports the Daily Voice. Shakoor is on trial at the Mitchell’s Plain Regional Court for his mum’s 2015 death. He lived alone with his mum in Talefsig, Cape Town. According to the paper, last Thursday Gafsa’s son-in-law, Moegamat Sharief Adams, took the witness stand. Moegamat testified that Gafsa had not been answering phone calls and that he and his wife, Rushana Adams, with their two children, visited the house the Sunday after her disappearance. “When we called the cellphone, the phone rang but it was immediately put off,” Moegamat testified. “When we came to the house, Shakoor stood in the doorway. “He said our mother went to Kimberley with the other auntie. He said a car came to fetch her (and she left) with Nicki Minaj.” The state is arguing that Shakoor (27), strangled his mother to death on 27 February 2015, washed her body and then hid it in their wheelie bin. Three days later, on 2 March, a neighbour found Gafsa’s badly decomposed body in the dirtbin outside her house. The State last week further revealed it was in possession of a cellphone voice recording which was made by a relative, Jamia Daniels. Jamia took the witness stand on Thursday and will remain under oath while the authenticity of the recording is being verified. It’s understood the recording contains both a confession and motive for the murder. Shakoor’s lawyer, L. Boer, said they wanted clarity on the recording’s authenticity. The paper said Gafsa’s relatives testified she had been afraid of her son and slept with a knife under her pillow. The trial continues on 11 July.
