WEST Rand cops bust 155 zama zamas this weekend. They were found with explosives, illegal mining equipment, gold bearing material and live ammunition. Police told Daily Sun they found 563 bags of gold dust-bearing material, 42 phendukas, 25 long life batteries, 27 gas bottles, four generators, 16 cutting torches, five hammers, 20 garden spades, a bush cutter, alcohol and explosives. Constable Gloria Maswanganye said the bust happened during Operation Okae Molao. “The operation has shone the spotlight on illegal mining in Mogale City and Randfontein. This is a joint venture by the police and Home Affair,” he said. Maswanganye said two men were bust for possession of explosives, one for possession of live ammunition and one for bribery. “Cops also recovered explosives and equipment used for illegal mining and gold bearing material.” She said illegal mining was connected to organised crime. “Zama zamas are heavily armed and when trespassing on operating mines, they set ambushes and booby traps for security staff and rival groups.” A meeting with mining companies was held, where Brigadier Mashadi Selepe highlighted the importance of formulating the district mining forum to investigate illegal mining, which risks people’s lives.
