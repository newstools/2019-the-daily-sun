Has Leonardo Castro become a bad player overnight? When he was at Mamelodi Sundowns, he killed a lot of PSL clubs together with Keagan Dolly and Khama Billiat. They were feared and known as the CBD. But this week, Amakhosi pulled Castro out of the voting for Carling Black Label Cup – even though he was their third-most voted player. So, this means he won’t be playing against Orlando Pirates next Saturday. This has added fuel to allegations that the Colombian could be on his way out of Chiefs. The Amakhosi fans did not help matters – they have been impatient to the gangling striker and have booed him several times. Has Castro become a bad player overnight? Or is it because the Chiefs coach does not know how to utilise him? Or is it because he not getting the kind of supply he used to get at Sundowns? What do you think has led to Castro being in this position?
