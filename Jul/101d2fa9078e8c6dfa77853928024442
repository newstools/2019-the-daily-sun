OPERATION Okae Molao is back! Yesterday, cops were busy with several campaigns under the operation in the Vaal area south of Joburg. Led by Gauteng Premier David Makhura, community safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and police chief Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, it saw many cars with foreign registrations seized, unregistered foreigners bust and fake goods recovered. Makhura said Okae Molao was happening every day. “It is important that it’s maintained,” he told Daily Sun. He said arresting people was important but that was only the first process. “We can’t keep Gauteng safe if people who commit crime are not convicted,” he said. Resident Thobile Songiwe (28) told the SunTeam it was good to see cops doing their jobs. “Seeing them fighting crime paints a good picture. I hope this isn’t the only time we’ll see them in our towns.” Themba Ndaba (45) said people in the Vaal live in fear. “Crime has taken over and cops don’t seem to be doing anything about it. It’s good seeing them on the streets. I hope this is a continuing programme.” Gauteng cop spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini later gave statistics of the arrests and said the operation has yielded good results. “On Wednesday night, our campaigns resulted in the arrest of 433 suspects. Three unlicensed firearms were recovered,” he said. Dlamini said some of the arrested suspects were wanted suspects. “Fourteen people were arrested for dealing in drugs and 28 warrants of arrest were issued. Thirteen cat and 45 crystal meth packets were recovered,” he said.
