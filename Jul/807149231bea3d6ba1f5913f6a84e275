THE spat between Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is getting nastier. In the latest episode, Mkhwebane has accused Gordhan of being personal in his court bid to stop her recommendations. Mkhwebane called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to take action against Gordhan after finding that the minister breached the Executive Ethics Act and enabled the establishment of a Sars’ so called rogue unit. Gordhan wants the findings reviewed. In court papers, he accused her of being used by the EFF in a bid to remove him from office, saying were this to succeed, it would serve the interests of state capture. “The office of the Public Protector and advocate Mkhwebane personally acted in breach of their constitutional duties to be independent and to exercise their powers and perform their functions without fear, favour or prejudice,” he said. In response, Mkhwebane said she was disappointed the minister’s application contained personal insults. She said she would only comment on facts as engaging in personal insults was below the dignity of the offices she and the minister occupied. Mkhwebane said she would appose Gordhan’s application. The EFF said it would join Mkhwebane in opposing it.
