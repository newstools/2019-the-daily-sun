BAFANA Bafana’s dream of Africa Cup of Nations ended painfully as they crashed 2-1 to Nigeria at Cairo International Stadium on Wednesday. The Super Eagles will face either Madagascar or Ivory Coast, who play on Thursday in the semifinals. Goals from Samuel Chukwueze and William Ekong accounted for South Africa exit.Chukwueze put Nigeria ahead in the 27th minute. Bafana had to wait for 44 minutes to get the equaliser, which came through Bongani Zungu. The France-based midfielder headed in from a free-kick, the goal needing the use of VAR to be confirmed. Zungu’s second in the tournament was as crucial as his winning header against Namibia in the group stages, ensuring South Africa get back in the game. But in the end, it counted for nothing as Ekong guided a corner kick into an empty net, on the stroke of full time. A feisty affair was always expected between the antagonists, not least with a place in the semifinals at stake. Yet it ended in tears for Bafana as the Super Eagles marched into the last four.
