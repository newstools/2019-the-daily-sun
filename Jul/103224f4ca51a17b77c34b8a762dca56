Zamantungwa Khumalo was beaten to a pulp on Thursday, allegedly by her cousin. According to Zamantungwa, he promised to finish what he started. The 25-year-old from Zola, Soweto, told Daily Sun she was left with six cuts to her head and had to get 18 stitches. She said the trouble started as she was cleaning her room and the main switch tripped shortly after her cousin (28) came home. “I asked my cousin’s kid to tell him to disconnect whatever he’d plugged in. The switch kept on tripping.” She said she asked respectfully after the power had tripped five times because of his heater. “He then punched me in the face, and when I got up to pick up my shoe his dad came and choked me, pinned me against the wall and tossed me on the ground.” Zamantungwa said her aunt held her while her cousin bashed her head until her other cousin pulled her away. She stopped a passing police van and was told to go to the doctor for a J88 form. She opened a case and her aunt and uncle were bust on Saturday, but her cousin was still at large. Captain Mavela Masondo said two suspects aged 55 and 53 were arrested and due to appear in the Protea Magistrates Court today.
