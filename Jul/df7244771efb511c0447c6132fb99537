WHO do you think is the most popular player at Kaizer Chiefs? The same question would be asked again at Orlando Pirates... While the return of the SOLD-OUT Carling Black Label Cup is gradually building up nicely, fans of both Soweto giants spent the better past of their time on their cellphone devices voting for their favourite players they would like to see play. The tournament is scheduled for FNB Stadium on 27 July where a full house is expected. This tournament, which was replaced by the Shell Ultra Helix Cup last year due to the Fifa World Cup, uses a unique system where fans are in charge of selecting their favourite players who will be fielded on the day. Their audited votes also have the power to substitute non-performing players, even on the day of the game. There is also the Champion Coaches who will be sitting side-by-side with the actual head coach of their clubÂ  Micho Sredojevic and Ernst Middendorp. By Monday morning, Chiefs were leading with votes on 480 031 already cast by their supporters. In what came as a shocker, veteran striker Bernard Parker is leading with votes on 71 212, which is 4504 more than goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune 66 708. According to a chart published by Carling Black Label on their social media, Pirates have gathered 378 068 already, with Augustine Mulenga top of the chart with 35 863, about six votes more than goalie Brilliant Khuzwayo who is standing on 30 707. The irony is that Khune and Khuzwayo have been favoured to play. Justin Shonga, Mthokozisi Dube and Thembinkosi Lorch have also been thrown in the Pirates mix, while at Chiefs, new signing Lazalous Kambole from Zambia and Joseph Malongoane are still on the bench fighting for their place. For all the TEAMS and votes, see the graphic.
