It’s time to put an end to the view that mums should look after family before themselves. If you are a mum and you look good or do something for yourself, you will hear people say: “She looks good but her kids are not taken care of.” I’m not saying mothers should neglect their kids. What I’m saying is that if you are a mum, look after yourself first before you look after others. If you neglect yourself, who will look after your family? It’s better for people to judge you for putting yourself first than falling into a depression, or hating your kids or family because all you do is work for them even when you are sick. Do not pretend to be okay when you need a hug, or you need to lie in bed and rest. Tell your kids or partner that you need to rest. Tell them that you need a massage and they will understand. You will be surprised that they won’t mind taking care of you for a day or so. It also creates a bond between you and your children – you get to spend quality time with them. Teach your kids to be independent and do things for themselves. Being a mother is a blessing, not a curse. A happy mum makes a happy family. She also helps the family grow. ) Constance Moyo
