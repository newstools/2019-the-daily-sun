MASKANDI star Njoko lost his guitar at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. This has led to rival artists pointing fingers at each other and once again getting involved in a war of words. The guitar disappeared during the Impucuzeko Maskandi Festival, which attracted over 30 000 fans to Durban. The guitar apparently went missing after Njoko lent it to Mthandeni. Mthandeni told Daily Sun: “My guitar went out of tune during my performance so I used his. I put it down during my set to dance but when I went to pick it up again, it had disappeared. I was very shocked.” He said he was convinced Khuzani took it because he was backstage at the time. However, he said he would buy Njoko a new one. Khuzani denied stealing the guitar, saying Mthandeni took it because he was jealous of Njoko’s blossoming career. “Why would I steal a guitar when I have my own? I have 10 guitars and each album has its own guitar,” he said. Speaking to the SunTeam, Njoko said he didn’t want to get involved in the rivalry and only wanted his guitar back. “I lent it to him with an open heart and I want it back because I want to use it. I don’t have a problem with either one of them,” he said. He said Mthandeni didn’t tell him about the stolen guitar on Saturday and he only found out on Monday. When asked which kind he would want it replaced with, he said he wanted that particular one as it was expensive and it was the only one he felt comfortable playing.
