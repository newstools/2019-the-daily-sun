SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIROA ~ BLOODY clash between two rival prison gangs on Monday left at least 57 inmates dead, 16 of whom were decapitated. Authorities said the riot began at around 7am at a prison in the northern city of Altamira, Para state. Brazil has been struggling to control its overcrowded jails. Prisoners belonging to the Comando Classe A gang set fire to a cell occupied by inmates of the Comando Vermelho (or Red Command) gang. Most of the dead died in the fire. Two guards were taken hostage but later released. “It was a targeted act,” state prison director Jarbas Vasconcelos said. He, however, said there was no prior intelligence suggesting an attack was imminent. Videos circulating online show inmates celebrating as they kicked decapitated heads across the floor. In May, 55 inmates died in prison attacks in the northern state of Amazonas. In 2017 weeks of violence in the same state resulted in 150 prison deaths as gangs, backed by two drug factions, went to war. Brazil’s justice ministry said it was working with Para authorities to identify those behind the latest attack. It said gang leaders would be transferred. – REUTERS
