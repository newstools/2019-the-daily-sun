The Gupta brothers have been fined just over R50 000 by Indian authorities for littering. This after someone "relieved themselves in the open" during the lavish weddings of their two sons at the Auli ski resort in the Himalayas. According to The Economic Times of India, Satyapal Nautiyal, executive officer in the Joshimath municipality said "a fine of Rs1.5 lakh (about R30 646 as of Monday) has been imposed on the Guptas for scattering garbage and another Rs1 lakh (about R20 430) for defecating in the open". The report said the municipality had also sent a copy of the "challan" (invoice or official document) to the event management company that made the arrangements for the weddings, which cost an estimated 200m Indian rupees, or around R43m. Nautiyal added that 814 000 Indian rupees (R166 804) had also been sent to the company for "collecting the garbage left behind after the weddings". SOURCE: NEWS 24
