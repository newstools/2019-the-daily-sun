A MAN found guilty of rape will remain in custody until September while awaiting sentence. His bail was revoked. Obert Nyathi (26) from Islington, outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga, cried uncontrollably as he was led to the Mhala police cells after his conviction. Nyathi appeared before magistrate Reginald Cloete in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge. Nyathi pleaded not guilty to raping a nine-year-old girl in June last year. The court heard that after the rape, Nyathi threatened to murder the victim and offered her R200 to keep quiet. But the girl told her neighbours after they realised she was uncomfortable and could not sit properly. Nyathi told the court he didn’t rape the girl, claiming she made up the story to destroy his name. “I was at work on the farm and people who said I raped this girl planned this,” he told the court. The case was postponed to 4 September for the victim’s impact report to be heard before sentencing.
