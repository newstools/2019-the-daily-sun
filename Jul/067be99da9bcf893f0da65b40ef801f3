GARETH Bale’s future at Real Madrid took another twist when he was left out of the Spanish side’s squad for two friendly matches in Munich, starting with Tuesday’s game against his old club Tottenham Hotspur. “Bale did not travel in order to resolve his future,” Spanish sports daily Marca reported, adding that Real Madrid were still in talks with Chinese side Jiangsu Suning who had offered the Welshman a three-year-deal worth R20 million a week. However the Chinese club appear to have shut the door on Bale and sports daily As says he could be headed for a Premier League return. “Bale wanted to stay (at Real Madrid) but Zidane has made that impossible,” said As. Frenchman and Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has made no secret of his desire to offload Bale who joined Real Madrid in a then world record R1,5 billion move from Tottenham in 2013. The Spanish press has been mooting a possible return to Champions League finalists Tottenham although Bale’s salary demands are likely to be far beyond the pay structure at the north London club. Bale’s agent Jonathan Barnett has already insisted that any deal which sees the Welshman leave the Bernabeu would have to be a permanent one and not one that sees him shipped out on loan. “Gareth is one of the best players on the planet. I can guarantee you he will not be going on loan to any club,” said Barnett.– AFP.
