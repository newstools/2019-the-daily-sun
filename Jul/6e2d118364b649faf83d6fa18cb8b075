BRUCE Bvuma first attended the Soweto derby as a kid with his dad. Now he is set to make his debut in one of the biggest derbies in world football when the Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper turns out against Orlando Pirates in the sold-out Carling Black Label Cup at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Among the 84 000 fans, expected to squeeze into the Calabash, will be Bvuma senior. The 24-year-old has been voted into Amakhosi starting line-up, replacing first-choice goalie, Itumeleng Khune, who has been withdrawn through injury. “The derby brings back childhood memories when I went to the stadium with my father as a young kid, supporting Chiefs,” said Bvuma. “When I saw my name in the starting line-up, I called him (father) to say ‘you can’t miss this one’. I know he is busy on weekends. But I want him to be there, just to watch me play in the derby. “The derby is one of the biggest matches I will ever play in, I won’t lie. So I can’t wait for Saturday and showcase my capabilities. “There is no friendly in a derby, but with God on my side I will be able to perform.” Of course, the journey to claiming the number spot is still long for Bvuma, with Daniel Akpeyi also in the fray. And even though the fans have raised their opinion as to who they would like as Itu’s deputy, Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp may not be swayed. However, Bvuma has grown in the last few months and it may be a matter of time before he gets more opportunities. He said: “With everything that I got, including being in the Afcon I believe I stand a good chance of competing with Khune. I believe I stand a good chance to fight for the number one spot. I can’t wait for him to come back so that we can start playing. Not that I’m playing because he is injured. “Not that I’m putting pressure on myself. I know I have to perform. There is not time to learn, but time to step up and take authority.”
