FIX this school now! That was the clear message from frustrated residents and parents. On Friday, parents of Goakganya Primary School pupils and residents in Klipgat, North West blocked roads with burning tyres and stopped classes to demand the education department’s attention. They claimed the school building wasn’t safe for pupils or teachers. They said they asked the department to renovate the school but their plea fell on death ears. Thabo Phahladima (42) said the building is 66 years old. “In 2016, a classroom roof was blown away and hasn’t been fixed. This building could collapse at any time. It has cracks everywhere.” He said the only way the department would hear them was if they acted. “We’ve been trying to get help. Last year, a kid fell into a pit toilet and after that, the department got mobile toilets. “We feel they want something bad to happen before they renovate the school.” Thabo said they’d keep protesting until something was done. “We can’t let our children die.” Parent Thandi Skhosana (36), said she gets worried on rainy days. “Whenever it rains, my children don’t go to school because I don’t want them to be injured if something happens,” she said. Education spokesman Elias Malindi said they knew about the situation. “The department delegated officials to plead with residents to allow pupils to go back to school but we couldn’t agree. We’ll keep speaking to people about progress while pupils attend school.” He said they condemn any form of violence that disrupts learning.
