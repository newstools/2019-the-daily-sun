PEOPLE can quickly recognise Emmanuel Morema’s drawings. The work of the 23-year-old from Lenyenye Village in Tzaneen, Limpopo, has received a lot of attention and impressed celebrities. Emmanuel recently posted a social media picture in which he and Malwedhe hitmaker King Monada show off a portrait of the singer. Emmanuel told Daily Sun he doesn’t only draw celebrities but anyone who wants to have a portrait done. “This started as a hobby, but my pencil work has become a way of putting bread on the table.” He was glad King Monada liked his work. “Being recognised by well-known people motivates me to work harder. I’m proud of the work I produce for my people. “I grew up enjoying drawing but didn’t know I could depend on it for a living. “I ensure that there’s a message behind every portrait.” It takes Emmanuel only 30 minutes to complete an A4 drawing. “Many people see my work as difficult. It’s not. This is from the heart.” King Monada was impressed by his talent. “It’s important to support every artist to make us grow and become the best province,” King Monada told the People’s Paper.
