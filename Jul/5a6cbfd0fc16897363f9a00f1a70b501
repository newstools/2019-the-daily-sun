BLACK Leopards striker Karabo Tshepe has given an indication of satisfaction to the coaching tactics of their new boss, Lionel Soccoia. The Frenchman joined Lidoda Duvha last month, succeeding Englishman Dylan Kerr. “He is a good coach and we are learning a lot from him daily,” said the 30-year-old forward. “There is a language barrier but despite that, we are having a good time. We have told ourselves that we have to learn fast and adapt to his tactics before the season starts. “From what I have seen from the coach so far, he is an experienced mentor who knows football.” The Randfontein-born player is also impressed by their latest acquisitions, so far. Lidoda Duvha have acquired the services of Thuso Phala, Mogakolodi Ngele, Thabo Matlaba and Abubakar Mumuni. “This shows how serious we are this coming season,” said Tshepe. “We’ve signed experienced players and some have won trophies in the PSL. We will have a strong team this time around, which will be competing for trophies, and not fighting relegation next season.” Tshepe, who was previously linked with a move away from Leopards, dismissed that as unfounded rumours. “I am a Leopards player and I am enjoying my football here,” he explained. “My situation can only change if chairman David Thidiela tells me that another club have approached them about me. “But I am happy with the likes of Phala, Abubakar, Matlaba and Ngele.” Tshepe has also appealed to their fans to be patient with their new signings. “This is a new environment to these guys. They might need some few weeks to adapt and gel with the rest of us. But we have welcomed them,” he added.
