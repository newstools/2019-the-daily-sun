ONE win, two losses! And so Bafana Bafana’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations chapter is closed… or maybe not quite. Moubarak Boussoufa struck with two minutes left as Morocco edged South Africa 1-0 in their group D fixture at Al Salam Stadium on Monday night. South Africa are now fourth in the best third place log, below Guinea, DR Congo and Kenya. Kenya, Angola and Benin are still in the running for the spot, going for their last group matches on Tuesday. What now for Stuart Baxter and his men? They face an anxious wait to find out if they will be staying in Cairo for the Last 16 or head home. It could have been a different story for Bafana, had they went onto the pitch with the intention to win. Throughout the preparations, Baxter has invariably stressed the importance of defending better from the set-pieces. But Bafana conceded from that area of their game, just as it looked as though a walk away with a point and improve their chances of going through. Not for the first time in a major tournament, questions will be asked of the commitment of the players.
