THE days of stinky farts are over. WE all know that one can disguise the sound of a fart but not the stench. A French inventor has invented a pill he claims  will make your farts smell like roses or chocolate. They also come in ginger, violet, chocolate, and lily of the valley — and can be given to pets too.Christian Poincheval, 69, said he got the idea while “at a table with friends after a copious meal when we nearly asphyxiated ourselves. He told The Sun: “The gas wasn’t great for our table neighbours. Something had to be done about this. "You can disguise the sound of a fart but not the stench.” He began selling the pills as dietary supplements to locals before expanding his range to “add a touch of humour for any occasion”. Christian advises taking them a week before stinky guffs would be unacceptable. A powder version is available for dogs. Its website says: “If you are tired of rolling down the car windows trips then this is for you! Capsules are packaged discreetly to avoid any embarrassment.” Pet owners can simply sprinkle the powder onto their pets' food rather than having to feed them pills.
