THE
man who stabbed a homeless man appeared in court and his case was postponed
again! Manusi
Mothupi (40) appeared in Pretoria Magistrate Court on Wednesday. The
case was postponed to 19 August for further investigations. Gauteng
Provincial National Prosecuting Authority, Phindi Mjonondwane said: "The
case was postponed and the investigations still going on." His
brother, Oupa Mothupi (45) told Daily Sun that the matter was being
complicated. "The
problem is that they keep on changing his case, at first they said it was
assault and now they say attempted murder." "As
family we are not happy with the police investigations on the matter," he
said. Oupa
said his brother is innocent and the case has a lot of loopholes. He
said the case is tarnishing his name and the family name. "We
want to find closure, and this should come to an end," he said. Oupa
said if the man is found guilty his brother can be charged like all other
criminals who has committed crime. The
suspect is suspected to have stabbed a homeless man on May in Muckleneuk in
Tshwane.
