 ADDRESSING the crowd at the Pieter Roos Park in Parktown Johannesburg, former president Jacob Zuma said it’s time for the truth to come out. “I thought the time has come, that we must speak the truth,” Zuma said. Zuma further showed appreciation to the supporters who came in their numbers to support him. He said the organization (referring to the ANC) is at a critical moment in its history, and the members should remain in their trenches to defend the ANC.
