SECRETS is a new short-form film that you have to see to learn a thing or two about your money and dodgy investments schemes. SunMoney attended the screening of this amazing film, which was launched at a glittering premiere at NuMetro’s Hyde Park cinema. Nedbank is said to be behind this film. Khensani Nobanda, Nedbank group executive marketing and corporate affairs, said they were happy about film, a first for the financial services industry. “Given the extent of the problem, we felt it was important to initiate a national conversation about the secret mainsprings of our money behaviour, and to cultivate a positive attitude,” she said. When it comes money issues, Mzansi statistics are shocking. One in three Mzansi people have lost money they invested in pyramid schemes; three out of five spend more than they earn, and 82% of small businesses fail because of bad cash flow management. Nobanda said SunLanders could learn so much from this film as stories are powerful ways of communicating important issues in all cultures. The bank has partnered with psychologist, Dr Tshepiso Matentjie, to create a framework for this journey based on the concept of emotional wealth. Dr Matentjie said the idea is to introduce the concept of emotional wealth, the mindset that supports the attainment of a positive relationship with money within the context of our own personal goals.
