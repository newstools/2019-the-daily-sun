WHEN she had nothing to do, gogo Miriam Lesang (76) would sleep all day. Her son, 46-year-old Themba Cebekhulu, thought his mum was still sleeping when she didn’t wake up on Saturday morning. Themba didn’t suspect anything on Sunday as well and assumed gogo was still asleep. It was only on Monday that Themba realised something was wrong. Rats were crawling all over gogo’s body. He called his aunt Sonto Mpungose (53), who lives a few houses away. “We found rats eating away at her body when we arrived,” said Sonto. Gogo Miriam from Zola 1 in Soweto used to collect recyclable material and kept it in the house. “That’s perhaps how the house ended up with so many rats,” she said. Sonto said they had to use a broom to move the rats from gogo’s body. “That scene was very traumatising. My sister didn’t deserve this,” she said. She said gogo lived with her two mentally disturbed sons. “That’s why it was hard for them to realise quickly that something was not right,” she said. The family have no means to bury Miriam. Lehlogonolo Swarts of Hlonis Funerals said:“I’ve secured a grave for gogo. “I was told about this sad situation by a friend and decided to help.” Anyone who can assist the family can call Daily Sun on 011 877 6060.
