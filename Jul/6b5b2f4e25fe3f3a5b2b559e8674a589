A TRACKER is usually used to discover stolen cars. But a muthi tracker can also be used to expose cheating lovers. Sangoma Skhunisivuthamanzi Mkhize told Daily Sun if a person wants to track a partner, sangomas can give them muthi to apply. “The muthi is applied to the punani or 4-5 before sex. Once you’ve had sex with your partner you will know if your partner is cheating,” he said. “The muthi shows you a vision of your cheating partner or you might even feel as if you are having sex yourself.” He said the person who cheats will have problems. “If it’s a man his 4-5 might just fall asleep. If it’s a woman she may start vomiting non stop,” he said. Nokulunga Dlamini (30) from Mofolo, Soweto said she used the muthi. “I’m not worried. He will come back to me for a poke.” Mfundo Shabalala (42) said he loved and trusted his wife. “But I know people get tempted so I put this tracking system on her.” On Daily Sun’s Facebook page, SunReaders were asked if they’d use the tracker. Godfrey Malibe said: “What for? You track him, you find out he is in Pretoria when he said he was at work. What next? Divorce or tears?”
