“PLEASE help me find my son.” This was the plea from Marry Shabangu of Kagisanong View in Kgabalatsane, North West. The 50-year-old mum is devastated, following the disappearance of her son Ofentse (29). He went out on Tuesday and never returned. Marry’s biggest concern is that her son is deaf and mute. She said the fact that he doesn’t know how to communicate with people makes the family even more worried. Marry told Daily Sun: “I can’t sleep or eat. The fact that I don’t know my son’s whereabouts eats me alive.” She said the day Ofentse left home his dad became worried. “We thought he was taking a walk, and my husband went after him. He gave chase until Ofentse disappeared,” she said. Marry said they have been looking for him everywhere since the day he left. “I don’t know why he ran away, but wherever he is, I know he’s confused and wants to come back home,” she said. She said one of their neighbours said he heard people at an initiation school saying there was a man there they didn’t recognise. “He might have run there and my worry is that he can’t use sign language to communicate. When people talk to him, he imitates them, so that might get him in trouble,” she said. She said Ofense was wearing a red T-shirt with words printed on it and grey pants with white stripes on the sides when he disappeared. “I know people read this paper. If anyone might have seen him somewhere please come through with information,” she said. North West police spokeswoman, Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani, said police have registered a missing person’s case.
