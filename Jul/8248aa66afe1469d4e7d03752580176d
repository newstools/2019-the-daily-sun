RESIDENTS of Marikana squatter camp were tired of waiting for streets lights in their area. So they decided to do things for themselves. Community leader Xolani Thukwayo told Daily Sun: “We installed electricity ourselves while government was deciding when to electrify our area.” He said they knew it was wrong and dangerous to install electricity illegally. Resident Solomzi Ncapayi (34) said: “Crime was high before we installed the street lights, but now things are better.” He said they would have nothing if they waited for government. “Every time we complained, we’d be told we had occupied private land. While government is sorting that out, we’re doing things ourselves.” After a service delivery protest in the area, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde’s spokeswoman, Bianca Capazorio, said: “The situation in Marikana is complex as the land is privately owned and the community developed invaded land. The matter is the subject of a Supreme Court of Appeal case which will be heard on 3 September.”
