NOMAWETHU’s neighbours were so envious of her beautiful home, they called it Sandton in Payneville. But her dream flat went up in flames when it was set on fire last Tuesday. Nomawethu Mgedile (50), from New Canada in Soweto, thinks jealous people are behind the incident. “I don’t understand how people could be this cruel,” she said. Nomawethu said cops told her someone threw a petrol bomb through a window. “I was at my neighbour’s house when I heard people screaming and shouting that a flat was burning.” She said when she checked, she found it was her flat. “I panicked and saw neighbours trying to put out the fire. “I did not know what to do. “I was in shock.” She said most of her clothes were in the room that was on fire. Nomawethu said she was confused as she didn’t have a bad relationship with anyone. She said some of her neighbours were laughing and saying her Sandton place had burned down. “I lived humbly and worked very hard for everything I had.” She said people said she dressed smartly and her house was nice, which is why they called it Sandton. “These people have set me back so much. “I don’t know where to turn for help and now my life is upside down,” she said. Mahlodi Masipa, one of Nomawethu’s neighbours, told Daily Sun she was with her when the building was set alight. “We heard screams and went to look outside, only to find it was her flat that was burning,” she said. Captain Nomvula Mbhense of Orlando Police Station said a case of arson has been opened and police were still investigating.
