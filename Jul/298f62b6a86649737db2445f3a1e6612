KASI schools across the country have for years been struggling with overcrowding. As such, the Mark Headbush Foundation built three extra classrooms at Elundini Full Service Primary School in Motherwell kasi. The classrooms were unveiled yesterday by Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani. Principal Ntsiki Bono said: “We have 885 pupils at the school, built in 1990. We admit pupils with learning and physical disabilities.” She said many of them needed specialised support. “The overcrowded classrooms made it difficult for all the children to learn. The only solution was adding more classrooms. “I pleaded with the foundation to assist us and it agreed. This will definitely add value to the school.” Businessman Mark Headbush said: “It’s critical to the development of kids to enable them to make a positive impact in our country.”
