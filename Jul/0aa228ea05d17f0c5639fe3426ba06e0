The father of a Cape Town Hawks detective was gunned down in
Melkbosstrand on Tuesday morning, according to the Hawks. Nici Heerschap, 74, was shot twice in his vehicle and died
on the scene, said Captain Philani Nkwalase. He is the father of Detective Warrant Officer Nico
Heerschap. Nkwalase said the shooting happened near the father's home.

case in the Cape Town Regional Court on Tuesday and was also investigating
figures in gang circles and the underworld for firearm and vehicle fraud,
according to Netwerk24. Nkwalase said they were investigating who was behind the
shooting. Asked whether the murder had anything to do with Heerschap
Junior's investigations, he said: "The motive for the killing is the
subject of our investigation." SOURCE: NEWS24
