RESIDENTS are afraid of speaking their mind at community meetings. This is allegedly because their shacks get destroyed if they do. Daily Sun spoke to residents of Glen Marikana squatter camp, near Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni, whose shacks have been destroyed. Lulama Msimang (50) said her shack was torched in November after she was allegedly seen wearing an ANC T-shirt and speaking to ANC members. Jeffrey Malerotho (37) claimed his shack was destroyed after he was seen wearing an ANC T-shirt. Nthabiseng Manaka (28) said she was threatened for voicing her opinion at a residents’ meeting. A pastor told Daily Sun his church was destroyed because residents allegedly held meetings there. “That’s not true,” he said, denying the church hold meetings. Captain Jethro Mtshali confirmed incidents of assault and malicious damage to property had been reported. Two police vehicles and three security vehicles were damaged. EFF leader Isaac Mampane said he knew nothing about shacks that were destroyed. “Residents are too violent for us to even think of that,” he said.
