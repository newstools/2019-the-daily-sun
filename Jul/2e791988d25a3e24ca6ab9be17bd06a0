THABO has taken it upon himself to save people’s lives. He runs a tyre business next to the road and is afraid passersby will fall into a trench. So he has been guarding the hole for about a month. He said he reported the trench to the municipality after a pipe was fixed and the trench was left open. “A contractor dug up a deep hole a month ago and vanished. The company left a very dangerous deep trench full of muddy water,” said Thabo Silo (37) from Peterswart in Mangaung. He said he sometimes woke up in a panic to check whether kids were playing near the trench. “My heart will stop if this isn’t fixed!” Thabo said he was always warning passersby about the trench. “We urge the municipality to close it before there is an accident. “Even elderly people can fall in there and die. Last week I saved a biker who had fallen in there. Luckily I heard him scream for help. “I can’t do my work properly. I have to be a guard at the same time. “I can’t let people die in front of me,” he said. One of the residents Nthabiseng Ramokoena said: “The trenches make our lives miserable – we have to monitor our kids as we’re scared they may drown.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said they were not aware of the hole. “We will send our team. We promise we will close the trench,” he said.
