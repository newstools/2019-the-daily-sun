IN a bid to improve from their last seasons' poor displays, Maritzburg United has signed three international players. On Wednesday evening the Team of Choice which sustained their PSL status via promotion / relegation play-offs confirmed the signings of former Bidvest Wits and Bafana Bafana play-maker Daylon Claasen. Claasen has been training with Maritzburg United, having cut ties with Bidvest Wits. For the longest time, Claasen has been considered one of the most promising youngsters to have emerged from the country, and there were high expectations when he joined Ajax Amsterdam when he was 18. But two years later he joined Belgian side Lierse, had trials with English Premiership side Everton and subsequently signed with Polish side Lech Poznan, and later with German club 1860 Munich.But he returned home having neither made a mark nor fulfilled the potential, which earned him a Bafana debut aged 20. Claasen who had a short stint with Wits where he struggled to get game time has now joined Eric Tinkler's charges alongside New Zealand-born left-back Dan Morgan, Micah Lea'alafa from the Solomon Islands. The trio joins Phumlani Ntshangase, Judas Moseamedi, Gabriel Nyoni, Kwanda Mngonyama and Yusuf Jappie who have already signed for Maritzburg ahead of the 2019-20 campaign. Club chairman Farook Kadodia is excited with the clubs new signings and he is expecting a lot from them. He told the club website: "The club has struggled for a while for a specialised left-footed full-back." “We believe Dan Morgan will give us the attributes required in this position, he comes with good pedigree and will also be an asset when defending set pieces.” The chairman added: “Daylon (Claasen) is a player who comes with both European and PSL experience, and someone our coach believes will suit our style of football very well. "A creative player with superb technique and vision, he will complement the attacking players we have at the club.
