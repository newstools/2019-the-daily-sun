RESIDENTS of extension 29 and Rievasmaak squatters have gone to war. Residents of the Nelson Mandela Bay kasi said they were gatvol of izinyoka lines, which posed a risk to their kids, while the squatters said they needed power. Extension 29 resident and mum of three, Samantha van Rayner (36), said izinyoka lines passed across her yard and she feared for her life. “I feel like I’m living in an open grave. I’m trapped in a web of izinyoka lines. “The squatters don’t care about the safety of my kids. There was a mini substation in front of my house where they were making illegal connections, which killed passing dogs and cows. I reported it and the municipality put in a more secure substation. “However, the squatters broke it open with a grinder and reconnected wires.” Samantha said she complained to the squatters but they didn’t listen. A squatter (31) said it was dangerous but they needed electricity. “We don’t mean to cause trouble but all we want is electricity and we are willing to pay for it,” he said. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki condemned illegal connections, saying they put lives at risk. “Communities should report these matters to 0800 2050 50. We do have an electrification programme for shacks and we’re busy with Wells Estate and Kamvelihle.”
