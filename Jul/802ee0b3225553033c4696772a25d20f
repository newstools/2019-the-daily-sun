 South African model Mirriam Ngomani's leg was broken in an alleged
racist attack at a casino in Pretoria in the early hours of Thursday, according
to a report. The Sowetan reported that Ngomani was with her fianc√© Tobias
Zehetleitner at Time Square in Menlyn when a white man believed to be in his
20s took issue with their display of affection, as they were holding hands. "I asked what he was doing and he said 'what is wrong with you?
You're dating a monkey'," Zehetleitner told the publication as he
recounted his ordeal. The man was pulled away but the couple and alleged attacker crossed
paths once more when they were leaving the casino at around 03:00. The man, who has not been identified, allegedly began spewing racial
slurs at Ngomani. "I walked up to him and tried to reprimand him." Zehetleitner told the publication the man punched him in the face and he
retaliated. He claimed the man's four friends who were with him also beat him
up and knocked Ngomani down and kicked her. Ngomani's fiance passed out and suffered injuries to his head and face.
Ngomani needed to be treated for a broken left leg. The couple indicated that they had given statements to police following
the incident. News24 tried to get comment from Tshwane police. It will be added once
received. The South African model is the latest public figure who has been
subjected to alleged racism in a public space. DA member of Parliament, Phumzile Van Damme recently took to twitter to
recount an alleged racist incident she experienced at the V&A Waterfront in
Cape Town. Van Damme claimed she had an altercation with a woman after which she
allegedly told her she would "push her aside". The politician further claimed that when she went outside, the family
was standing there "in a threatening manner," News24 earlier
reported. Both parties have since buried the hatchet after the V&A Waterfront
issued an apology to Van Damme. SOURCE: NEWS24
