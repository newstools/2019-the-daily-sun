TURKISH top flight side Yeni Malatyaspor have confirmed the signing of Kaizer Chiefs defender Teenage Hadebe on a two-year-deal. Hadebe was a regular in Chiefs defence last season under Ernst Middendorp though some fans appeared to question whether he was the right fit in central defence. The 23-year-old was at times guilty of giving away silly fouls and generally did not seem to win over the Amakhosi faithful. The Bulawayo-born star made 19 appearances in all competitions in what was a season of disappointment for the Ernst Middendorp-coached outfit. Nonetheless, it seems he has been shipped out to Malatyaspor though Chiefs are yet to officially confirm his departure. The Turkish club's official website said: "EY Malatyaspor tied the colours of Zimbabwean national team stopper Teenage Hadebe and Australian midfielder Luke Brattan. "Transfer work continues without interruption for E.Y. Malatyaspor, two players have been added to the squad. South African team Kaizer Chiefs, Zimbabwean defender Teenage Hadebe, who (has signed) a two-year contract. The 23-year-old is expected to join the camp today." Chiefs have also wished the player well on his future endeavors.
