BONGANI “Drogba” Ndulula is trying to revive his career and he’s set to join ABC Motsepe League side Polokwane City Rovers in the North West province. The 29-year-old has officially not played football since he was released by Kaizer Chiefs at the end of the 2015-16 season. The following season he joined Chippa United where he left the club without kicking the ball, under Dan Malesela, due to being overweight. “Ndulula is training with us, we are planning to sign him for 2019-20 season,’’ Rovers co-chairman Tyzer Temo told SunSport yesterday. Temo shares the club as a co-chairman along with former Orlando Pirates winger Tlou Segolela. In their squad, Rovers have also signed former Baroka FC defender and captain Olaleng Shaku and former Pirates graduate Mduduzi Nyanda, who previously played for Platinum Stars along with Segolela. Added Temo: “We expect Ndulula to bang in the goals because he has still got it based on what I have seen at training. This season is do-or-die for us, this is our eighth season in the ABC Motsepe League. We are strengthening the squad because we want to gain promotion to the NFD.” Ndulula’s last match in the PSL was with Amakhosi against Platinum Stars on 24 January 2016, when he came on to replace Camaldine Abraw at Cape Town Stadium. “He’s not in bad shape and we’ll try all our efforts to get him ready before the season gets underway,’’ revealed Temo. The Aliwal North-born striker first caught attention when he was signed by Pirates in the 2009-10 season from Bloemfontein Celtic. He will forever be remembered for scoring one of the goals that delivered the league title for the Buccaneers against Golden Arrows at Orlando Stadium in the last match of the season to see then Rudi Krol’s side triumph. He also played a key role in Bafana’s qualification in the 2015 African Cup of Nations (Afcon) edition under former head coach Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba in Equatorial Guinea.
