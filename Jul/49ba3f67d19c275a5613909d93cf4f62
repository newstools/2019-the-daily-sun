RAPHAEL Chukwu was one of the best imports Mzansi has ever had. He arrived and caused a lot of havoc in the PSL. The Nigeria Number 9 was a man for the big occasion and he would pounce when list expected during major cup finals – most notably the Rothmans Cup. Chukwu, now 43 years of age, was famous for Sundowns’ duels against rivals Kaizer Chiefs. During the 1997 Rothmans Cup final against Amakhosi, Chukwu pounced in the last minute and denied Amakhosi victory.An angry and frustrated then Chiefs coach Paul Dolezar spoke to The Star newspaper after the heart-stopping equaliser: "I thought I had the cup in my pocket. Then Sizwe Motaung allowed Raphael Chukwu to score. I wanted to die," said Dolezar.  That last-minute equaliser by Chukwu forced extra time and then a replay, which Chiefs won on penalties. Never one to hide his feelings, Dolezar lashed out at Motaung after the first match, describing Motaung’s mistakes as "CRIMINAL."Chukwu arrived in Mzansi from Nigerian club Shooting Star, where scored 21 goals in 31 matches. A lot was expected from him and he did not disappoint at all. From Sundowns he joined Italian Serie A club Bari where he spent 5 seasons. He then returned to the Brazilians for a second spell in 2004. He played for Nigeria’s Super Eagles 10 times. He will forever hold a special place in the hearts of the Ka Bo Yellow nation followers.
