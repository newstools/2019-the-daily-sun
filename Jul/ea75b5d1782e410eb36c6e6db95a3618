Members of the Aliwal North Stock Theft and endangered species Unit managed to successfully arrest five suspects for stock theft. Cops spokesperson Captain Ursula Roelofse said that members of Aliwal North STES followed up positive information and arrested five suspects and recovered 30 sheep that was loaded in a BAW combi on Friday, last week.  These suspects are also alleged to be part of a syndicate operating all over the Eastern Cape as well as the Free State. The five suspects ages various between 39 and 22 years old.  The suspects will appear in the Aliwal North magistrate court on Monday.  The Deputy Cluster Commander Colonel Mpho Rabela commended the members on the excellent success as stock theft is a priority crime in our area. The arrest of the members of the syndicate will also make the linkage to other cases possible.
