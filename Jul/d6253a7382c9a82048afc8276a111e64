“MY BONES never lie, they saw the Bafana Bafana victory over Egypt coming.” These were the words of sangoma Nzama Maluleke after South Africa’s shock 1-0 win over Egypt on Saturday. However, instead of celebrating the win with everyone else,Nzama went to his indumba to thank his ancestors. Nzama, from Meadowlands in Soweto, last week told Daily Sun his bones predicted the win after he had a dream that Bafana would make it to the last 16 of Afcon. “I burned imphepho and thanked the ancestors for showing me this,” he said. Bafana Bafana are due to face Nigeria in the quarter finals but Nzama said he couldn’t comment on their chances as he had not thrown the bones to predict the results. “I will wait for my ancestors to tell me and then ask for confirmation from the bones,” he said. Sabelo Mbatha from Orlando in Soweto told the SunTeam he didn’t believe the prediction when he first heard about it but was happy to be proven wrong. “I’m one of the people who criticised Nzama’s prediction but I’m the one who blew my vuvuzela the loudest. “It’s so funny,” he said. When Daily Sun published a story about the sangoma’s prediction on Friday, many SunReaders said it was just a dream and it wouldn’t come true. On Saturday night, soccer fans across Mzansi anxiously sat and watched the game. They were overjoyed when Thembinkosi Lorch scored the only goal of the match at Cairo International Stadium. Just as Nzama had predicted, South Africans went insane after the game.
