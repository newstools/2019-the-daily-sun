A FAMILY is distraught following the disappearance of a 16-year-old matric pupil. Thando Masango from Embalenhle, Mpumalanga, was last seen by her family on 13 July after she left home to attend Saturday classes. According to her grandmother, Sarah Masango (70), Thando has never before left home and not come back. She said the family had initially thought she was with her friends when she did not return home. But her friends were also clueless about her whereabouts. “We tried looking for her. We went to all her friends, but they told us they also didn’t know where she was,” gogo said. “I’m stressing because I don’t know if she is still alive or not. I can’t sleep at night not knowing whether she has eaten or not. I beg her to come home.” The family have opened a missing person’s case and hope police will help them trace Thando. “We appeal to communities to assist us trace our daughter’s whereabouts any.” Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe confirmed to Daily Sun that a case of a missing person had been opened. He appealed to anyone with information leading to her whereabouts to contact the nearest police station.
