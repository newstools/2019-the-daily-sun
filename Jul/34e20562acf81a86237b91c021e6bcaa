THEY have shut down the Tshwane CBD and won’t back down! Besides top management, municipal workers protested outside the Tshwane House on Monday, demanding an 18% increase. The workers said their salaries have not been increased since 2017 when Co-operative Governance reclassified the city as a Level 10 municipality. SA Municipal Workers Union’s deputy regional secretary Valentine Matlala said: “Workers want to be treated the same as management.” Matlala said the managers adjusted their salaries by an increase of 18% in June and backdated it to 2017 when the change was implemented. Matlala said they were protesting peacefully while waiting for a response from management. Daily Sun asked Matlala if the protest would stop. “We will listen to workers,” he said. On Friday city’s acting spokesman Klaas Mafomme said the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union lodged a mutual interest dispute with the SA Local Government Bargaining Council. “The city will take part in the appropriate bargaining council processes,” he said. Mayoral committee member Sheila Senkubuge said the city suspended A Re Yeng and Tshwane Bus Services operations after protesters used municipal vehicles to block roads. “Illegal movement of city property, vandalism and disrupting service delivery are not acceptable,” she said.
