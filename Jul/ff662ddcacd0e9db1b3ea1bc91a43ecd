JOHANNES Mosoma said he was seriously injured by public order cops last Tuesday. On Monday, Johannes (34), from Burgersfort in Limpopo told Daily Sun  he was on his way to deliver invoices to a mining company. Johannes, who runs a tyre repair business, claimed he was walking in the road when two bakkies stopped and four cops jumped out. He said they kicked him to the ground before shooting him with rubber bullets. “Because there was a protest, the company couldn’t make it to my workshop to collect the invoices, so I agreed to go to them. “I tried to explain it to the police but they accused me of blocking the road. I was beaten like an animal.” Johannes said the cops took him to the police station, where he was released on a warning after spending three hours in the cells. “I pleaded with them to take me to hospital because I was in pain but they refused. I went to Dilokong Hospital the next day and managed to open a case on Saturday.” Acting Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa said a case was opened against the police. “Investigations have been launched but no one has been bust.”
