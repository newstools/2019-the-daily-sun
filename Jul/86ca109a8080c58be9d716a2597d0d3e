The big black cat just sits there among the wires, staring at people. And people stare back, believing it’s responsible for power outages. Portia Nkuna (43) said: “The cat has been on the pole outside my house and we haven’t had electricity for six days. “It’s making life difficult for us,” she said. “My children are restless and I can’t sleep.” The cat’s been up and down their transmission towers for months and the residents of Jakkalsdans in Winterveld, Tshwane, are scared it may be cursed. No one has come forward to claim the cat and that has caused more fear. “If somebody throws a rock at the cat or tries to chase it away, it appears near their house and their electricity goes off,” said a resident. Some residents said they believe it was sent by evil people. SPCA officials arrived to remove the cat. Inspector Mishack Matlou said they are happy people didn’t take the law into their own hands. “They may have killed it because some people say it is used for witchcraft,” he said.
