POLICE raided an illegal mining operation yesterday and seized equipment and destroyed illegal structures. When the cops arrived at the mine in Matholesville, Joburg, the zama zamas fled, leaving all their tools behind. Among the items found were explosives, detonators, phendukas, heaps of sand containing gold and mining equipment. As police demolished the shacks used for storage, some illegal miners could be seen complaining from a distance. During the operation, an explosive went off, causing panic in the area. Illegal miner Givers Ncube said the cops were taking bread away from them. “We’re working here. We’re not bothering anyone, and now cops are taking our jobs,” he said. He said the damage underground was from long ago and was not caused by them. “I’m aware that working here can cause damage,” said Givers. Conel Mackay of the City of Jo’burg said the area was a disaster waiting to happen. “The illegal mining is happening next to a fuel pipeline, which could be catastrophic,” he told the People’s Paper. He said there were also illegal water and electricity connections. Police did not say how many people were arrested. Captain Mavela Masondo said: “A multi-disciplinary O Kae Molao operation focused on illegal mining in Roodepoort.” “Police will continue with these operations in all the areas that are affected by illegal mining.”
