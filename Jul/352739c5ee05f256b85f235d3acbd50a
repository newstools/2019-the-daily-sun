AS people gathered around, she came wearing a wedding dress, with thorns around her chest. She moved slowly towards the bath in the middle of the square. “I’m going to be rich. I’m going to win the Lotto,” she was heard saying on Wednesday. The bath in the CBD in Bloemfontein, Free State, was circled by candles. In the video, which went viral, the woman is seen holding an umbrella. She hangs wet clothes on a washing line. Onlookers whisper that she’s up to no good. She then takes off her wedding dress and gets into the bath, wearing an underslip. That’s when the onlookers realise she’s taking part in the Vrystaat Arts Festival, held at the University of the Free State every year. Ukhona Mlandu, the woman in the bath, said she’s an actor and her display was from a play that’s about life as a woman. Police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Thabo Covane said: “The woman was removed by police. I don’t know what happened after that.”
