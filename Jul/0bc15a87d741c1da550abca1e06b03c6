ORLANDO Pirates laid down the marker ahead of the new season with a convincing 2-0 Carling Cup victory over rivals Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday. First-half goals from Augustine Mulenga and Thembinkosi Lorch proved the difference as the Buccaneers put their arch-foes to the sword in a thrilling Soweto derby clash. Of course, pre-season form can be deceiving. But in the context of their performance, the Buccaneers can march in the new season brimming with confidence. Even coach Micho walked on the touch with a swagger of a Formula 1 Mercedes team principal, admiring the beauty and agility of his sleek machine before the start of the race. On the other hand, Amakhosi look like a rickety jalopy still in need of some serious mechanical work before it could hit the Premiership race course. Ernst Middendorp was left wiping his hands off the oil and grease, still trying to figure out how he is going to revive his teamâ€™s flagging fortunes. As Bucs put into practice what they have been working in the pre-season, Amakhosi look lost... like a village boy in the big Joburg city. None of their new signings announced their arrival in Mzansi football. Lazalous Kambole couldn't translate his big pre-match talk with a notable performance on the pitch.But then again, the Cup was all about the fans and their choices...or so Middendorp would say.
