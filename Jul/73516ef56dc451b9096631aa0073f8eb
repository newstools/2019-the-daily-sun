BAFANA Bafana have remained united as the only way to deal with the barrage of criticism levelled at the team, according to captain Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo. Bafana face Morocco at the Al Salam Stadium tonight at 6pm in a fixture where coach Stuart Baxter and his men must avoid a loss to stand a chance of reaching the knockout stage. South Africa’s lukewarm performances at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) so far has irked the public at large. Even the team’s 1-0 win over Namibia on Friday did not trigger much excitement to the hard-to-please masses but Hlatshwayo says he and his teammates have taken the hammering on the chin. “We know what has been written and said about us, but we are focused as the team. We shut out the critics,” said the Bidvest Wits skipper. “We are united and have a tight bond. We’ll remain united because at the end of the day, we are doing it for the country.” The 29-year-old added that the team was regaining their passing game, an element that was missing in Bafana’s defeat to Ivory Coast in the first match. “When you look at the group, the easiest team you could say to beat was Namibia and we did what was expected. We also played our passing game. So the confidence is growing in the team.” Bongani Zungu scored the winner against Namibia. A win for Bafana will seal qualification while a draw may also be enough for South Africa to sneak in alongside the best ranked third place finishers. “It’s a do-or-die. We have to go for three points to get to the last 16,” said Hlatshwayo. Morocco have already qualified for the next round and it’s now left to Bafana and Ivory Coast to jostle for the remaining spots. The top two teams of each group, along with the best four third-placed teams, advance to the last 16.
