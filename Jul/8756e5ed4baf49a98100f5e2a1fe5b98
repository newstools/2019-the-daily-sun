REALITY TV star’s show and socialite Zodwa Wabantu’s reality show Zodwa uncensored is not going anywhere, despite numerous calls for it to be scrapped following her comments about gay men. When Zodwa uttered the words: “Gays think they are women, they have forgotten that they have 4-5's and not a punani” during her show, social media went into a frenzy. Some called for the star’s show to be canned while some rallied behind her. However, she is not going anywhere according to a statement sent by Moja Love. The views expressed by Zodwa are regrettable and she commits to learning. As media and content producers accept a measure of responsibility for this oversight,” it reads, in part. The channel further said in the statement that it is currently working with LGBTI organisation IRANTI on remedial action and to ensure that education around the issue is promoted.
