RETIREMENT is the last thing in the mind of former Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United midfield maestro Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane. In fact, the hard-tackling midfielder is on a search for a new home in the Absa Premiership after being released by SuperSport at the end of the past season. At the age of 37, the former Jomo Cosmos star said he still has a lot to offer in the field of play and reckons he can play until 40. While the search for a new club continues, he keeps himself busy with his role as the Engen Youth tournament ambassador. PSL legends such as the late John “Shoes” Moshoeu, Siyabonga Nomvethe and Hans Vonk played until their 40s before they hanged up their boots. Letsholonyane turned down an offer to work for SuperSport as part of the back room staff because he feels that he still has something to offer on the pitch. The former Bafana Bafana star doesn’t mind where his next destination will be. He said: “I’m also focused on my role as Engen ambassador. It’s a project closer to my heart, and helping aspiring footballers is something that gives me joy. “I will listen to any team that approach me. I want to see myself playing and training every day.” But Letsholonyane also stressed that he is not desparate for anything as he is willing to wait if teams don’t approach him as the new 2019-20 Premiership campaign is starting next month. “I still have the gas in my tank,” he added. “I feel like I’m still a young player. I work hard and take care of my body on and off the pitch, and believe that I’m a good example to young footballers.”
