The Economic Freedom Fighters have announced their intention to appeal the North Gauteng High Court ruling against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Judge Sulet Potterill ruled in favour of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan in legal battle against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane on Monday. HIGH COURT KLAPS BUSI! Potterill said the public protector or the office of the public protector are interdicted from enforcing the remedial action. The EFF said it had "noted" the court's decision to grant Gordhan an interdict against the implementation of the Public Protector's remedial action in her SARS-related report findings against him. "We are not surprised by this decision, which is why we had already declared on the day of proceedings, that we shall be going to the Constitutional Court," the party said in a statement. They sais this is because "we had realised how visibly irritated Judge Sulet Potterill was, when the black lawyers who were exclusively arguing against the exclusively white lawyers of [Pravin] Jamnandas Gordhan, [President Cyril] Ramaphosa, and all who wanted the interdict. "The judge was very pleased, and always willing to listen and hear the arguments of all those whites, whilst showing irritation, to the extent of constantly interrupting the black lawyers. In the proceedings, it was as if those black lawyers did not belong in that court. "Nevertheless, above all, we believe that the interdict essentially shuts down what is a constitutionally created institution. We shall therefore appeal this decision with the Constitutional Court. It is a fight to the end."
