A STUDY done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found only half of a person’s friends actually liked them. The study, done in 2016, defined friends as people you would do anything for. With this in mind, Daily Sun asked Facebook users whether they would let their friends know if they found out their partner was cheating. And it turned out there were not many true friends out there. However, many SunReaders had valid reasons for staying out of other people’s relationships. Others had different views.
