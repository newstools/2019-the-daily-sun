KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has declared himself content with the club's pre-season but admits their preparations have been disrupted by the absence of key players. Amakhosi are gearing up for their clash with Township Rollers on Saturday minus several of their first-team stars, with the absentees currently resting up following a gruelling Afcon campaign in Egypt. However, Middendorp was quick to point out that several players would be returning from a long-term injury. "We find ourselves with some of our key players missing due to their duty in the Afcon tournament," Middendorp told the club's official website. "We are not complaining but it is a challenge for us preparing for the new season without some of the guys. "For instance, we needed Daniel Cardoso and 'Rama' Mphahlele, because we were working on our defensive stuff." He continued: "We have been working hard for the past few days and I'm happy with the response from some of the players. "It is good that we do not have any serious injuries and some of the guys who were injured last season are on their way back to full recovery." And, Middendorp remains hopeful that more of his first-team stars will link up with the squad ahead of Saturday's friendly in Botswana. He said: "We have been keeping in touch with the technical and medical teams of the various national teams to check on our players and so far, there are no injury worries. "We hope more players will join us soon and will be with us when we travel to Botswana on Friday."
