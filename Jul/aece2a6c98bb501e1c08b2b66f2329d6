IT hurts Khaya that people think he is a thug. He told Daily Sun he knew people didn’t trust him but never thought they would attack him for no reason. Khaya Tshabalala (20) from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni said four men armed with hammers entered his yard on Friday and asked him about a missing trolley and bicycle wheel. “I got scared because I could see hammers in their hands. They obviously meant business,” Khaya told the People’s Paper. He said he told the men he didn’t know anything about the trolley or bicycle wheel and gave them permission to search the yard. Two of the men searched the yard, while the other two allegedly assaulted him. “I begged them to wait for the other two to confirm I didn’t have what they were looking for,” he said. A few minutes later, the two men searching the yard emerged empty-handed. But this did not stop them from hammering him. Khaya said he would be dead had it not been for his neighbours, Muzikayifani Zuma. “One of my neighbours heard my screams and called for help. The men fled when community members came,” he said. “I really hope cops find them and teach them a lesson. The damaged they caused is unbearable.” Muzikayifani (49) said he heard Khaya scream and called other residents. “The men fled when we got to the yard and we couldn’t catch them,” he said. “We will find these thugs with the help of the cops and they will regret ever stepping into Daveyton.” Lindiwe Moyo (38) said the men almost killed her Khaya. “We’d be talking a different story right now had the community not come on time,” said Lindiwe. Daveyton police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe confirmed that a case was opened and under investigation. “We’re appealing to the community to work with us to find these men,” said Maqabe.
