THE ANC and the its Youth League in KZN are locked in a battle over violent protests in KwaDukuza, northern KZN. After their protest was called off on Tuesday, the league in the General Gizenga Mpanza Region called a media briefing at the ANC offices in Tongaat yesterday. But branches of the ANC stormed the office, singing struggle songs to prevent the briefing from starting. Ndwedwe ANC branch secretary Bheka Dlamini said they are tired of the youth league using the situation to become celebrities. “We are the ones who were marching against the reinstatement of Musa Zondi and were shot at with rubber bullets. They are here to talk about something that doesn’t concern them. “They failed to mobilise the youth. Now they want to use the opportunity to be in the media. They should stop running around like headless chickens,” said Dlamini. ANC regional branch chairman Thami Mhlongo said they came to defend the ANC. “They shouldn’t use our offices. If they want to host a media briefing they should go to their office in KwaDukuza and have their briefing there,” he said. Youth league regional chairman Mfanafuthi Ngcobo said the ANC leaders know they’ll expose the corruption happening in KwaDukuza. “They came here because they know there’s a lot that will be exposed. We will have the media briefing to outline everything,” said Ngcobo.
