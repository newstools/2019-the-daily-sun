RDPs were meant to change people’s lives for the better. But Nolusindiso Nabo told Daily Sun her house has brought her family pain. The 32-year-old mum of three lives in a crumbling house in Govan Mbeki kasi, Port Elizabeth. “This house was built in 2008 with too much sand and the walls get huge cracks when it’s windy,” she said. “On the floor, there’s no cement, just soil. Windows and doors are falling off and the roof is leaking. “My mum died last year, and at the time she was complaining about the house. “The councillors came here and promised to demolish her house and give us a temporary house, but that never happened. “I’m now raising my kids, aged between two and 10, in a ticking time bomb.” Nolusindiso said she’d accept help from anyone willing and able to provide it. “I’m unemployed and I survive on child support grants,” she said. “I appeal to anyone for help because we’re freezing in this house.” Eastern Cape human settlements spokesman Masiza Mazizi said the issue needed to be raised with the project steering committee, the municipality and the department. “An assessment will be done with the National Home Building Regulator Council, and if there are any structural defects found the contractor will be instructed to fix the house provided the problem was reported within five years,” he said.
