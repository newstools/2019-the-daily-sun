A COLOMBIAN man was detained at Barcelona-El Prat airport. This was after half a kilo of cocaine was found hidden under an oversized toupee, Spanish police said yesterday. They found a package stuck to his head with about $34 000 (R471 000) worth of cocaine in it. Arriving on a flight from Bogota, the man attracted attention as he looked nervous.s and had an unusually large hairpiece under his hat. “There’s no limit to the inventiveness of drug traffickers trying to mock controls,” said cops. They enclosed a photo of a middle-aged man,  apparently still wearing the toupee though with his eyes blocked in the image, but gave no more details of his identity. The Colombian was detained at the end of June. -– REUTERS Over 100 kilos of cocaine were seized by Spanish police at the Barcelona-El Prat airport in 2018.
