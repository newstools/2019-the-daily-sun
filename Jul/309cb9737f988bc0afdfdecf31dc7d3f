IN life there are good and bad days. The big question is: are you financially prepared for both? Marlies Kappers, head of marketing at DirectAxis Financial Services, told SunMoney that, although one could not predict what might happen in future, problems are easier to deal with when one is financially prepared. She said the first thing to consider was what you could realistically and affordably insure against. These include events that are difficult or impossible to recover from financially if you’re not insured. They could include your home burning down, your car being stolen or written off in a crash or a long hospital stay. She said one insured against all or most of these things either because it was a condition when one took out a bond or got a loan to buy a car. It could also because it was a necessity to insure an expensive asset. Many employers offer medical aid or a hospital plan as part of a salary package. But what about life’s more common upsets, such as when an essential appliance such as a freezer or oven stops working, a car breaks down or a toilet or pipe gets blocked? Research shows that very few people save enough to deal with these sorts of problems, which one can easily manage if one has an emergency fund. “Having money set aside makes it easier and less stressful to deal with unforeseen problems and means you aren’t forced into decisions you may later regret,” said Marlies. Here are tips: , Ideally you should aim to save about 5% of your income each month for unexpected expenses , Keep your emergency fund in a separate account, so you’re not tempted to dip into it. Money market and tax-free savings accounts are two options to consider. Ideally set up an automatic transfer , Keep saving until you have enough to cover your normal household expenses for between three and six months and , If you need to use all or some of the money, try to cut back on non-essential expenses.
