BATTLING fraud, corruption, financial and service delivery problems, the Road Accident Fund is about R9 billion in arrears each month, with finalised claims that cannot be paid. A meeting was held at its Polokwane offices after multiple crashes in Limpopo. Acting CEO Lindelwa Xingwana-Jabavu said they compensate victims, and modify houses for victims living with disability but face huge challenges. The fund plans to stop using lawyers, as it spends billions on legal fees, which could be used to pay claims. She urged accident victims to lodge their claims directly rather than through lawyers. “The process does not involve litigation and the time taken to get to trial. You get all the money due to you, while with a lawyer you have to pay 25% for legal fees,” she said. General investigation manager Paul Modipa said people also lodged fake claims. “Attorneys have been struck off the roll, doctors and police arrested and others are in jail or serving suspended sentences for fraud-related cases,” he said. Thabo Modubanya (32), who was in a crash in 2013, said: “Direct claims are fast. It took me six months to get all my money.”
