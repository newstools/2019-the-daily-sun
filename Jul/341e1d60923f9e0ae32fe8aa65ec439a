SOME Soweto residents are suffering from electricity outages. And it’s starting to affect their businesses, lives and health. They said it was painful to see other sections with electricity while they suffer in the dark. Dikeledi Zulu (41) from Emdeni said she has been without electricity for a month and it’s starting to affect her business, Ebuhleni Daycare. “I started using paraffin to cook for the children but I have to pay the woman who stays opposite my house to do it as paraffin isn’t safe for the kids,” she said. She said she contacted Eskom a number of times but nothing happened. Residents of Ukhiza Street in Moroka said their electricity had been out for almost two weeks. Amitage Street in Mzimhlophe and half of Nkungo Street have not had electricity since last Sunday. Martha Mthiya (72) said she had not eaten a proper meal in three days. Eskom spokeswoman Dikatso Mothae said some areas of Gauteng are experiencing equipment failure. “This is caused by illegal connections which create overloading and failure of transformers and mini-sub-stations,” she said. Mothae said the company will communicate information about the situation to councillors in all affected areas.
