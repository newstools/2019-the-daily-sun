NKUNGUMATHE residents were over the moon this week when they heard the education department would be building a new school. Nkandla residents in northern KZN and AfriForum won a case against the department in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Resident Mthokozi Mchunu (46) said: “Nobody is above the law. The school was supposed to be built in 2010.” He said people have been fighting for a new school since 1996. “Many pupils have to walk 25km to get to schools in other areas.” AfriForum deputy CEP Alana Bailey said leaders of the Mpungose Traditional Council and residents had approached them. “We believed the rights of pupils had to be protected. “It’s tragic that a lengthy court battle was needed to provide children with their Constitutional right.” KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said the ruling was in line with their aims. “The court demanded we ensure all pupils in the area are provided with proper learning material and furniture in a reasonable period. “It also told us to provide extra classrooms by the end of 2021. We’ll look into our limited budget to prioritise the court order.”
