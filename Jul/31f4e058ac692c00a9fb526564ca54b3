Cops have promised to make sure fake doctors are bust. Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said more arrests would be made after a municipal worker and a man pretending to be a doctor were bust last week. Last Tuesday, the metro received a complaint from the environmental waste management depot. The complaint was about a suspicious doctor’s note from the worker who had been absent from for more than a month. “Members were able to establish the doctor’s note was fraudulent,” said Kgasago. The bogus doctor was bust a few days later in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, and the worker was nabbed at his workplace. Kgasago said the worker allegedly paid R400 for the fake note. “While checking the fake doctor’s papers, it emerged he was from the DRC and wasn’t using his real name. A case of fraud was opened against the two at Kempton Park Police Station,” said Kgasago. “Ongoing investigations are expected to reveal more fraudulent medical certificates and more suspects are expected to be arrested.”
