THE Springboks got their Rugby Championship campaign with a convincing 35-17 bonus-point victory over the Wallabies at Ellis Park Stadium on Saturday. Converted five tries, two in the opening half tries from debutant Herschel Jantjies and Lood de Jager as well as three in the second half from Sbu Nkosi, Cobus Reinach and another from Jantjies, the scrumhalf, completed a perfect outing for South Africa at their historic stomping ground. The supposedly experimental team punched above its weight as Bok coach Rassie Erasmus reaped rewards for his bravery and forward-thinking. Herschel Jantjies, however, was the man of the match, marking his maiden Test with a clinical performance operating superbly behind the forward pack. Together with back-row partner, Elton Jantjies, Herschel played like a season halfback, quick to release the ball from the base of the scrum, thus allowing for swift attacks. Australia were slower off the starting blocks, but gradually breathed life into their game as Dane Haylett-Petty answered Jantjies’ try with one of his own. He could have bagged a second try, had he not fluffed a golden chance on the try line. That mistake proved costly as the Boks regained their rhythm, breaking the gain line at Will.Bernard Foley pierced through the Boks  defence for the visitors’ second converted. But momentum couldn’t swing their way as the Boks defended stoutly, Makazole Mapimpi reveling at the collisions.Erasmus would have been pleased to see his debutants give a belter a performance. He has asked for a healthy selection headache.Now he has it!
