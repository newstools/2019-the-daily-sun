AFTER a nine-year-old girl from Pietermaritzburg in KZN was confirmed to have been killed by H1N1 on Friday, KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said there was no need for panic. She said the pandemic influvirus, which first appeared in 2009 was now a seasonal flu virus during winter. “It’s neither a serious infection nor a reportable disease and is being treated as a normal flu,” Simelane-Zulu said. She said people vulnerable to flu and need vaccination before the flu season include pregnant women, HIV-infected people, as well as adults, or children under six who have medical conditions. “We’re calling on all school authorities, doctors and residents to use restraint, because by referring to an outbreak without being sure might create unnecessary panic,” she said. She said they would keep investigating. “Those who display chest pain or shortness of breath should seek medical attention. If anyone thinks they or their children are suffering from aggressive flu, they must go to their healthcare facility.” She said the best way to prevent the spread of flu is for those who are sick to stay at home. Nhlanhlo Mbatha (33) from Etafuleni in Pietermaritzburg said: “We’re hoping for H1N1 campaigns, because we’re scared.”
