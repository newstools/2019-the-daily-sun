DELIVERING his State of The
Province Address Gauteng Premier David Makhura says he will use the R60 billion
infrastructure budget to create jobs. He said the R60 billion
will be used to improve access to water, sanitation, electricity, housing and
roads in deprived areas. According to Makhura this
will facilitate the creation of over 100 000 jobs in the construction sector. “Over the next five years,
we will introduce special economic zones that will boost manufacturing,
increase exports and employment, while at the same time linking local suppliers
to transnational corporations operating in our province,” Makhura said. Makhura said over the past
five years, the Gauteng economy attracted R199 billion of foreign direct
investment and 469 000 new jobs were created. He further said this was a
result of a joint effort and collaboration between government and the private
sector. The premier said the 6th
provincial administration’s five priorities are the economy, Jobs, infrastructure,
education, skills revolution, health, human settlements and land release.
