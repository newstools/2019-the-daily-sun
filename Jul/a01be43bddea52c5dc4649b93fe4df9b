BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter believes his side had to show courage to give themselves a chance at beating Egypt in their Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). That is exactly what they did, walking away 1-0 victors after stunning the hosts at the Cairo International Stadium on Saturday to book a spot in the quarter-finals of the competition. Thembinkosi Lorch scored the all-important goal for Bafana in the 85th minute to set up a quarter-final clash with Nigeria. The Pharaohs had no answer for a spirited Bafana who managed to keep their star player Mohamed Salah quiet for most of the game. “We had three days to put together a game plan and I think the player did really well,” said Baxter. “We had to play in a brave way, press high against such a good team as Egypt. “But for me that was the only way we could win the game because if we allowed them to build possession and get the ball into their best players, we were going to have massive problems. “It took courage from the boys, we had reasonable control of the game for most parts.
