GAUTENG Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has upset the people of Katlehong South. The Ekurhuleni kasi residents were furious after he recently claimed they burned a local school during a protest over electricity. They said there was no protest when Katlehong Primary School burnt down on Thursday, and demanded that the MEC apologise in person for saying on Twitter they had burned down the school. They also wanted to know where he got his information. Resident Maria Ghoba said they had electricity issues but many people had kids at the school. Nomfundo Ntabeni told Daily Sun: “If there was a protest, there would have been traces of burned tyres on the road. We are hurt he accused us of burning our school.” Nomfundo said on Thursday morning, they heard a loud explosion at the school and saw thick smoke rising into the air. The fire only affected the grade R block. Grade R mum Lindiwe Mbele (23) said parents have not heard where their kids will be taught when they return to school today. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “It is suspected this act of arson might be the work of a single resident. We have an undertaking from residents to help track the culprit. Only two grade R classrooms were burnt and affected pupils will be temporarily accommodated in two classrooms at the school. Learning starts today.” Lesufi said: “We support residents and will work with the police to catch this rogue element. But we don’t have funds to repair the school. The department is at an advanced stage to check what can be salvaged from this mess.’’ Gauteng Infrastructure Development MEC Tasneem Motara urged people to stop destroying school and centres. “For the kids in Katlehong, it means no learning as classrooms are not able to be occupied by teachers or pupils.”
