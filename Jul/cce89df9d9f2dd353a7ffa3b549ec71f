THE YOUNG women said they would do whatever it takes to embrace their talent. They were competing at the Miss Sekgopo Frozen 2019/20 beauty pageant in Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof in Limpopo on Monday. They didn’t mind being in their costumes the chilly weather, as their sights were firmly set on taking the crown home. Organiser Tumi Machuba (25) said the event aimed to uplift villagers and empower young girls to reach for their dreams. “We want to give back to the community and give them the opportunity to showcase their beauty because they live in rural areas, where opportunities don’t often come to them.” Tumi said the pageant helped to improve self-confidence and leadership skills and encouraged positive qualities like interview skills and public speaking. The entry requirement was a pack of sanitary pads for needy villagers and there were 10 contestants. “We had a surprise two-minute interview during the competition that contestants didn’t know about. “We wanted to see their true personalities,” Tumi said. Makgosi Sebola (20) was crowned Miss Sekgopo Frozen 2019/20, Alice Rametse (18) was first princess and Tshepiso Morifi (19) second princess. They all received sashes, crowns and goodie bags. There were also awards and prizes for the best-dressed contestant, the best smile and Miss Entrepreneur. Makgosi said she was grateful to have won. “ The contest boosted my self-confidence and I will continue entering pageants until I get to the highest level,” she told Daily Sun.
