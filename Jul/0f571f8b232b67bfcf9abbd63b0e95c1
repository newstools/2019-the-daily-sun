STRICT security measures have been put in place to reduce the level of crime during the sold-out Carling Black Label Soweto derby between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3pm). South African Police Service (Saps) Captain Lorraine van Emmerik warned those without valid tickets to stay away from the venue. She emphasised that those who will arrive at the venue under the influence of alcohol, visibly or not, won’t be allowed to go inside the stadium. She went on: “Intoxicated persons will be removed from the stadium. You will be subjected to a search of your personal belongings at the stadium’s spectator access points. Joburg Metro Police Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar has advised the hordes of fans planning to come to the stadium that public transport will be made available through Metrorail, BRT, Top6 Taxis, KTK Shuttles and Rea Vaya to and from the venue. “Free parking is available for all patrons attending the derby using their own transport,” said Minnaar. “Strict traffic control measures will be implemented from 7am in the precinct and the general public (non-spectators) should avoid the stadium precinct from 10am until 7pm. “We are ready for unplanned eventualities. There are 92 entry points at the stadium and 136 tenstiles. But if all 84 000 fans arrive an hour before the game we will have a backlog, so please arrive early.” Carling Black Label brand director Grant Pereira has urged fans to arrive early as they will be entertained with various activations including music by BET award musician Sho Majozi, Dr Malinga and Gqom princess TDK Macasette. “We have DJ Stokie who will play in the activation area. We have few surprises for the fans and the gates open at 11am, so let us get there early. I believe South African fans will be united into the idea of seeing quality football.”
