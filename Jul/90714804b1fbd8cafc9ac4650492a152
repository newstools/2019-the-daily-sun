SOME residents in KwaNdokwenza in Nelson Mandela Bay have been hanging used nappies on street lights. According to residents, the situation was becoming a problem. Nomalungisa Matodlana (54) said: “Why are they doing this? “The metro collects refuse weekly, but they don’t want to wake up early to put their rubbish out for collection.” One of the residents said he did it because he didn’t have a dustbin. Health councillor Yoliswa Pali appealed to residents to stop dumping illegally. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said anyone found littering or dumping illegally could be fined up to R1 000.
