NO amount of money will be enough for Kaizer Chiefs to let Khama Billiat go. Coach Ernst Middendorp is not ready to sanction any transfer move for the twinkle-toed star… and seemingly he will never be. Egyptian giants Zamalek were reported to have tabled a R23 million offer for Billiat’s services while other reports linked the star with Moroccan side, Raja Casablanca. But any club boss hoping to sign the Zimbabwean international had better not hold their breath. “We are in front of a season, we have put a lot of thinking and strategies in place and at this time there is no way to move into a direction of saying, Khama Billiat can go because the money is coming in. "No! And that’s very clear!” said Middendorp. “I was never confronted with any offer or whatever. And there’s no way to give the go-ahead from the technical team in the moment to release players like Khama Billiat or other players.” The 28-year-old ditched Mamelodi Sundowns for Amakhosi at the start of last season and will remain with the Soweto giants until 2021.
