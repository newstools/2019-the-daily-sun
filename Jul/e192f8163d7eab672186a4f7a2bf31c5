woman, were found lying dead in a pool of blood with gunshot wounds. Police investigations led
to the recovery of a firearm with four live rounds next to the two bodies. “The deceased were
identified as Ephraim Mashile and Beauty Mashile, who were confirmed husband

ruled out. A case of two counts of
murder are being investigated. Ngoepe encouraged members
