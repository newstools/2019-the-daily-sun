A TEENAGER from Nelspruit died when he fell into Mosera Mine while visiting Vosman. The 17-year-old’s body was retrieved from the abandoned mine in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga on Monday morning. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said on Sunday at 10am, children were playing in the unfenced mine area in Vosman kasi, when one of them fell into the mine. Hlathi said there are open shafts around the mine and while the kids were playing, the teen fell into one of them and drowned. “His friends ran to call his parents but when they reported the matter to the police, it was already too late for divers to enter the mine.” Hlathi said only on Monday at about 9am could divers retrieve the body. Lunga Rabela, a former security guard at the mine, said the 17-year-old’s death would have been prevented had they not been dismissed. He said they made sure no illegal mining took place on the premises. Lunga said they provided security services for over three years but since they were told to stop, due to a lack of money, people started illegal activities. Daily Sun tried to get hold of mine management but all their phones rang unanswered.
