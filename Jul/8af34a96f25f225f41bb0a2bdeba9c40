A Belgian man tried to create a new world record for the longest toilet break in history. According to India Today, Jimmy De Frenne (48) entered the Guinness Book of Records by sitting on the toilet for a straight 165 hours, however he only managed to do it for 116 hours, 5 days. He said, " I was very tired and my legs hurt but I believe in my success and try to make this record official." In an interviewed, Jimmy revealed he entered the competition because he likes people making fun of him. "Self-mockery is the best humor there is. Why am I doing this? Why not? There is nothing I like more than people making fun of me, because then I can do the same with them," he said. Jimmy took the challenge in a Bar in Ostend, Belgium in front of his family and friends.
