LANDI Masemola (32) is worried about her husband after he went missing last month. Samuel Sikhosana (27) left for work in Jozi and never came back. Landi from Tweefontein, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, said she spoke to her husband on his boss’ cellphone on 13 July. Samuel apparently told her he’d been promised a place to stay in Mamelodi, Tshwane. “After he left home we’d speak on the phone, but not anymore. “He told me he wanted to come back home because his working conditions were bad,” he said. “He told me his boss often left him alone in the house they were renovating, and only came back to bring him food and cigarettes.” She said she did call the boss, who had told her he didn’t know where her husband was. “I reported the matter to the cops. They called my husband’s boss, but he told them a different story. “I went to report the matter at Joburg Central Police Station. “When cops called the boss, he told them he didn’t know my husband.” The boss’ phone was off when the SunTeam called him. Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said a missing persons case was opened. Kgosana said anyone with information should call Landi on 060 944 5977, or Captain Vusimuzi Mahlangu on 082 318 9894.
