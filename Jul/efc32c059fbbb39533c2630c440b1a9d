SIZWE Mkhize’s learned the hard way not to play around with traditional healers. For the past month, zombies have been choking the 36-year-old at night, demanding he return R7 000 he stole from an inyanga. Sizwe from Lindelani, north of Durban, told Daily Sun: “I went for a consultation at the home of the inyanga at the beginning of last month. When he left me in his indumba for a few minutes, I saw a lot of money on the floor. I was tempted and stole it.” He said when he got home, the inyanga called him and asked if he took the money, which he denied. “As I am unemployed and have a one-year-old baby, I used the money to pay for our basic needs,” said Sizwe. He said after a week, the money was gone and the suffering began. “I started feeling zombies choking me at night, demanding I pay the money back.” Sizwe’s brother, Nkosinathi Mkhize (41) confirmed that Sizwe is troubled by zombies at night.“It’s tough. I don’t stay at home often but whenever I’m there we don’t sleep well at night. The noise he makes when these things choke him wakes me up.” Sizwe said his brother called the inyanga asking for forgiveness on his behalf but the inyanga was furious and didn’t want to hear anything. When Daily Sun called inyanga Mambeluhlaza Magwaza, he said: “I told my ancestors to deal with the thief. “He can come here with his family members and I will consult with my ancestors in their presence on the way forward.” Traditional Leaders Association president Sazi Mhlongo said Sizwe had to pay back the money or he would die.
