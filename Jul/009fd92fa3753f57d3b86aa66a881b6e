Will Khama Billiat go or stay? This is the question on everyone’s lips as the PSL transfer window draws to a close. Billiat, the Kaizer Chiefs star midfielder, is reportedly on the verge of rejoining Mamelodi Sundowns. But the Brazilians cannot be drawn on the matter as the Zimbabwean is contracted to Amakhosi…as Mosimane has explained. "I should be very careful on this issue,” said Mosimane. “I need to respect Chiefs. They are a big institution. And the league will fine me if they complain that I am poaching their players. “If we want Khama, then what we need to do is speak with the club. And they will say whether they are selling or not.” Billiat is understood to be keen on a return to Chloorkop, though he is still has two years left on his current contract. And Mosimane has not hidden his admiration for him. “Even (Lionel) Messi has got a price, let’s be honest. We all have a price, everybody has a price, even you the media. Even my players at Sundowns have a price. “Ask any coach if they would like to have Themba Zwane or Gaston Sirino and the answer is 'why not?'. But we have to be careful. We are not rookies. "But I can’t talk about it (Billiat) because he belongs to Chiefs. If I speak, they will report me to PSL. Last year John Comitis (Cape Town City boss) wrote me a big love letter (regarding Aubrey Ngoma). I must learn from that.”
