Sbahle explained that it took her an hour to take those first three steps and that it was extremely painful, but she had promised her mom that she would do it for her. She said it was a case of mind over matter.She recorded the moment to share with everyone who has been rooting for her during her journey to recovery and took the time to thank fans for their support. Your body can withstand almost anything. It’s your mind that needs the convincing ?? . . For the past couple of months, without much success, I’ve been attempting to at least take 1 step. Yesterday my mum managed to make me take 3 steps, and it took a whole hour. I cannot describe how mentally challenging it was! Today Zain encouraged me to try take a walk without focusing on the pain I’m facing??. For some miraculous reason, calling my bodyguard to come take a video of me, made me mentally ready to walk and record this milestone. Love y’all & thank you for the constant support. It pushes me forward ????‍? A post shared by  FitnessBunnie (@sbahle_mpisane) on Jul 24, 2019 at 4:57am PDT
