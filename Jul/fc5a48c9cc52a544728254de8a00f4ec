Mayor Zandile Gumede has survived the motion of no confidence against her. This
after ANC speaker William Mapena refused to allow the motion to take place. Councillors
were supposed to vote in the meeting on Wednesday afternoon, only to find out
that the speaker didn't include the motion on the agenda. The Democratic
Alliance which lodged the motion last week tried to raise it on the floor and
the speaker rejected it again. There
was heated argument between the speaker and the DA caucus leader Nicole Graham who
demanded the speaker to give reasons why the motion wasn't on the agenda and
also why he didn’t allow it to continue from the floor. Other
opposition councillors joined in and supported the DA, but the speaker objected
and closed the matter without giving reasons. Inkatha
Freedom Party councillor Mdu Nkosi and DA's Graham raised up again and asked
for the mayor's leave of absence form. Graham
said in terms of the rules a councillor can only be given one’s leave and
demanded to know who approved the mayor's leave. She
said the mayor wasn't on official leave anymore but continues to draw her R115
000 a month salary. The
speaker then put the mayor's leave on vote and ANC councillors voted in favour
of the continuation of her leave while the opposition voted against. The
mayor and councillor Mondli Mthembu have been on leave since June, when the ANC
asked them to take leave. It
was after their appearance in court for fraud and corruption. The
two are out on R50 000 bail and are returning to court on Thursday next week.
