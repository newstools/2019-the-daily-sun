NOKUXOLA Maram has been haunted for two weeks by images of gunmen attacking her family. The 28-year-old from Khayelitsha, Cape Town witnessed her mum and brother being shot on 29 June. Thugs invaded their house in Site B and fired shots at her mum, Nondumiso (60) while she was in the kitchen preparing food. They also shot her brother, who was left fighting for his life in hospital. “I’m heartbroken. I still can’t believe my mum is gone,” she said. Residents said they heard gunshots and a few minutes later, they saw a car speeding away. A neighbour said: “I saw a white car leaving and when we went to the house, there was blood all over the floor. “We rushed the wounded man to hospital.” Police spokesman Siyabulela Malo confirmed the incident. “A case of murder was opened following the incident. “The circumstances surrounding this incident are being investigated but no arrests have been made so far” he said.
