HE WAS being dumped, so the 26-year-old allegedly hacked his two sons with an axe. A six-year-old boy died at the scene, while the two-year-old is fighting for his life in hospital. The suspect was at home in Namibia kasi, Mangaung, when his girlfriend left for work on Tuesday morning. Instead of taking the kids to creche, he wrote a letter saying: “I can’t live without you. If you dump me, I am taking the children with me.” Neighbours went to help when they heard the children screaming but it was too late for the eldest boy. A neighbour said: “The unemployed man used to beat his girlfriend for drug money. She said he didn’t want to leave her shack.” The neighbour said she heard people screaming and went outside. “The dead boy was lying in the street and the man was running after the younger boy. Residents stopped him.” Free State Police MEC Sam Mashinini pleaded with people to go to the cops when something goes wrong. Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said: “A case of murder and attempted murder was opened after a 26-year-old suspect was bust. He’s expected in court soon.”
