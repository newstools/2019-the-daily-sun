FREE State DA leader and premier candidate Patricia Kopane has urged the community to be tolerant. This after two DA activists were shot and a third wounded on Sunday morning in Caleb Motshabi, Mangaung. Daily Sun published the story on Monday. The bodies of the men were found in an open veld near the construction site of a school. The community said the men were vocal about poor service delivery. One of the dead men was DA branch chairman Molokwane Mokgoro (38). His brother Siyenzile Thukwane (50) said he visited Molokwane at his home last week. “Molokwane was passionate about helping people and he wanted service delivery,” he said. “I believe in our justice system and trust that the law will take its course.” Rannono Mohapeloa (42), the brother of Teboho Lengosane (47), who also died, said police wouldn’t let him go to the scene. “I hope he fights his killers from beyond the grave,” said Rannono. Kopane visited the families and the victim who was rushed to hospital. “The men were vocal and very brave. They always said they were a threat. The families are in our prayers and thoughts. “We will continue to fight, but will do it the right way. The community thinks we are enemies but we are not,” said Kopane. Police spokesman Sergeant Peter Kareli said two cases of murder and one of attempted murder were opened.
