METRO cops seized a large amount of dagga on Friday last week Spokeswoman Sergeant Ruth Solomons said officers received a tip-off about a drug factory in Samora Machel and went there. They found 183 bankies, three plastic bags containing loose dagga, 36 parcels wrapped in newspaper, and big transport bags filled with dagga. “The value of the drugs has yet to be determined, and the officers recovered R3 798 in cash.” Solomons said a 41-year-old woman was arrested and charged with dealing in drugs. Resident Nokuthula Sapepa (40) said police did the right thing. She said it was encouraging to see cops following up on tip-offs while not revealing the identities of their sources. “More people will do the right thing by reporting these people because we know people who’re dealing in dagga,” she said. Lizo Goja (34) said most people selling dagga in the area were women. “Don’t underestimate women, They have the guts to do the most dangerous things. “I’m glad this woman was arrested and hope she’ll be kept in jail,” he said. Lizo said kids could easily access drugs because there were many dealers ekasi. “Police must just wait because more tip-offs will come. “We don’t only have dagga dealers here but also people dealing in serious stuff. “The community knows them very well,” he said.
