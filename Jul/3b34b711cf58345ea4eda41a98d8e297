THE Soweto Super United are still on track to become the first team to lift back-to-back Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) Games titles. The annual tournament taking place in the township of Alexandra, better known as “Gomora,” is heading towards the business end with the conclusion of the last 16 this past weekend. As is always the case, hordes of football fanatics gather at the Rotary Grounds to witness the action up close, making for an atmosphere that is unmatched at this level. The popular winter kasi Games have kept fans entertained for the past 18 years and this year’s edition is also living up to expectations. The Games have grown in popularity over the years, with fans travelling from across the country to attend. On the pitch, no team has ever managed to win the tournament in two consecutive years, a feat United are eager to achieve. The defending champions are well on their way to making that a reality having been one of the eight teams to book their spot in the quarter-finals this past weekend. They edged Elokshin 1-0 in what was an action packed encounter on Saturday to march into the last 8. Boasting the likes of former Orlando Pirates winger Khethokwakhe Masuku and former Polokwane City midfielder Linda Shiba, United are seen as one of the favourites to go all the way in the tournament. However, skipper Masuku believes they will have to significantly up their game if they are to make history by being the only team to defend their title. Said Masuku: “We need to stamp our authority and show that we are the champions. It will take more effort, we need to work as a team. That’s the only thing that can help us defend our title. “We need to score more goals and kill off games earlier because anything can happen in football. We just need to improve on our effort off the ball, that part of our game needs to get better if we are to be successful again this year.”
