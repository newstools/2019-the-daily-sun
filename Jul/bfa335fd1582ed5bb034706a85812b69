THE organiser of the Impucuzeko Maskandi Festival this week vowed to make sure there was no public poking at the event this year. The festival kicks off in Durban tomorrow. Xolani Mcineka said security would be tight at the event. There were reports last year that people were seen having sex inside cars and on grass at Curries Fountain Stadium. “Cops and private security will be patrolling inside and outside the stadium to make sure no one misbehaves,” he said. The show was moved to Moses Mabhiba Stadium this year to accommodate more people. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “Having sex in public is a serious offence. “Those who think they can go there and have sex in public will be arrested on the spot.” Artists expected to perform are Thokozani Langa, Shwi noMtekhala, Khuzani, Igcokama Elisha, Osaziwayo, Qhosha, Udlubheke, Imfez’emnyama, uNjoko, Jaiva Zimnike, Amageza Amahle, Bahubhe and others.
