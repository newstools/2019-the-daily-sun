A BUS meant for 65 was bust transporting 111 school kids on Friday. The bus was stopped in Dan House in Moretele, North West, during a road block by transport MEC Sello Lehari. He was horrified to see some of the kids standing next to the door holding on to whatever they could so they didn’t fall out. Department spokesman Freddy Sepeng said overcrowding was an issue raised by many community members and the MEC wanted to deal with it. “Residents also complained of some buses not being roadworthy,” he said. Sepeng said the bus was hired by the department to take kids to and from Kgaphamadi Secondary School in Bosplaas. It was confiscated and the school principal was instructed to make alternative transport arrangements for pupils. Sepeng said the owner of the bus would be held accountable. According to pupils, the bus was always overcrowded. One child said: “We know it’s risky and puts our lives in danger but we don’t have a choice as learning is also important.” A concerned parent said if the bus was involved in an accident, kids would have gone flying through the windscreen.
