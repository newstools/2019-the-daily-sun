A QUICK police response saved an Uber driver from hijackers in Port Elizabeth on Sunday morning. Police spokesman Captain Sandra van Rensburg said speedy reaction to a tip-off led to the arrest of two suspects. “According to police information, the complainant responded to a call out to pick up two clients at a gym in Humerail at about 5.15am. After he picked them up, the two suspects, aged 23 and 35 requested to be driven to Colchester. “When they reached Colchester, they directed him to drive onto a gravel road and then asked him to stop. One suspect was armed with a knife and they threatened the driver and robbed him of his belongings,” said Van Rensburg. “He was then shoved into the boot of his blue Swift Suzuki vehicle. They drove off heading back towards Port Elizabeth where they allegedly attempted to sell the vehicle in Gelvandale.” She said the vehicle was spotted in the northern areas of Port Elizabeth about three hours later. “At about 8am, K9 members received a tip-off about a suspicious vehicle in Fitchard Street, Helenvale. “Back up arrived and the suspects were confronted. The vehicle was searched and the Uber driver from Central, aged 23, was found in the boot of the car. A case of hijacking and kidnapping was opened at Kinkelbos and both suspects were detained. They will appear in the Motherwell Magistrates Court soon. “The complainant did not sustain any injuries during the incident,” said Van Rensburg.
