PRETORIA West
will witness some of the finest classic cars at the Cars in the Park event at Zwartkops
Raceway. The annual
classic car spectacular is organised by the Pretoria Old Motor Club. Spectators
can expect to see the latest Bullitt version of the Ford Mustang. This
metallic green beauty was specially built based on the latest Mustang to
commemorate the 1968 Mustang GT used in the film Bullitt, which features one of
the most famous car chase sequences in cinematic history. Steve
McQueen drives the Mustang 390 GT and a bunch of “bad-guys” chase him and get
chased in a Dodge Charger. There will also
be a number of Dodge Chargers on display at the event, as the “Mopar” amongst has
been enjoying increasing popularity amongst the muscle car fraternity. Muscle
cars, hot rods, classics from Britain, Germany France, Sweden, the list just
goes on and on. A rare car
that is listed amongst the special invites is the 1931 Nash Tourer that is
travelling all the way from Potgietersrus in Limpopo. The
Pretoria Old Motor Club will also be displaying just some of their membership’s
vast array of beautiful classic, vintage and veteran cars. The Cars in
the Park regularly attracts upwards of 10 000 paying spectators, and a fun day
will be in store for everyone. The event
will take place on the 4th of August, admission prices are R100 for
adults while children under 12 gain free admission.
