MTHEMBENI Ngiba (36) claims he has been living with unbearable pain for 16 years because a hospital failed him. Mthembeni, from Umlazi, south of Durban said he had three unsuccessful operations at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi in 2003. This was after he was shot in the left side of his stomach during a robbery. “I was grateful I didn’t die and was looking forward to healing from the injury and getting back to my life,” he said. His stomach was stitched up during the first operation. “I went home but after a few days, the stitches started leaking fluid that looked like water.” He said he went back to hospital for a second operation. “But when I ate bread, it came out through the stitches,” he said. After the third operation, they removed the stitches. “I spent nine months in hospital, as the wound was supposed to heal,” he said. He said when was discharged, nurses told him he would heal in due course. “But it has never healed. I cover it with bandages. “I have to work because I have children. I’ve been working as a truck driver for four years but my boss doesn’t know about the wounds because he might chase me away,” he said. KZN Health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said: “Since the patient has no carrier card, it has been difficult to find his file but he has been called to come to the hospital as soon as he can for an assessment.” Mthembeni said the clerk at the hospital told him his file was missing, probably as files are burnt after five years. “I don’t have the old card which dates back to 2003. “I only have the one from last year and I told them that when they called me,” he said.
