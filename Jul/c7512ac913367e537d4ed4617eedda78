A BROKEN stormwater drain has been troubling residents of Imbali unit 13 for four months. Nkanyiso Masuku (35) from the Pietermaritzburg kasi told Daily Sun they feared for their health and the municipality did nothing to help them. “Four months ago, we saw the stormwater drain had burst and kak was running out. We tried calling Msunduzi Municipality but couldn’t reach them. Their landlines were either engaged or rang unanswered,” she said. Nkanyiso said after struggling for two months, she spoke to the councillor. “He took down all the information to lodge a complaint. After a week, he came back with a reference number and said I must use it to follow up.” Nkanyiso said a few days later, municipal workers came at night and said they were not going to fix the drain because they were scared of being bitten by snakes. “That was the last time we saw them. When we call the numbers, no one answers. “The air we breathe is smelly and the burst drain is near a busy road where residents walk and small kids play. We are going to get sick. We want this fixed.” Councillor Thamsanqa Sithole said he knew of the problem. “I reported it to the municipality. After it wasn’t fixed, I raised the issue at the weekly meeting. If I see more days passing without it being fixed, I will raise it with the portfolio chairman.” Municipal spokeswoman Ntobeko Ngcobo said: “The relevant department was told about the matter and it was expected to be fixed yesterday.”
