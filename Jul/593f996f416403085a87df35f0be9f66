AFTER noticing that one of her grade 4 pupils was missing exams, teacher Yolisa Mpokela went to fetch the child. However, she was horrified by what she found at the pupil’s house on Wednesday! The teacher from Sigcawu Primary School in Crossroads, Cape Town, found the pupil sleeping in a tiny bed with all her siblings while her gogo was lying in another bed. “The situation was very bad. They didn’t even have food to eat,” she said. After Yolisa told her colleagues about the situation, they started visiting the home to clean and help in other ways. “The sad thing is that the gogo has kids but they don’t look after her or their children,” she said. The gogo, Nomasikizi Vunywa (79), said one day she would just go to sleep and not wake up. “I don’t like where my life is. My kids live with their boyfriends and they like booze,” she said. The gogo said she couldn’t go to an old-age home because there would be no one to take care of her grandchildren. She said although she had a pension grant, her daughter kept her Sassa card. The gogo lived with her four grandchildren, aged between four and 22. “When the older one is out hustling and the others are at school, the four-year-old looks after me because I sometimes struggle to walk,” she said. The gogo and Yolisa said they would be very grateful if any good Samaritans could help the family out.
