SINCE the murder of a woman on Monday morning, Umlazi residents have been living in fear. The 35-year-old woman, who had not been identified by her family, was killed in the kasi south of Durban on her way to work. Unknown men fired at the woman and she was declared dead at the scene. A resident said he was walking about 200m behind the victim when shots rang out. “I ducked for cover into a nearby bush. After it was over, I got up and ran home. I didn’t see who the woman was and I was too afraid to look,” he said. Mthokozisi Mkhize (54) said a number of people had been shot early in the morning, often during robberies. “Thugs rob people during winter when it’s dark, so maybe they were robbing the woman. I didn’t go to see her so I don’t know where she was from,” he said. Mthokozisi said the area would be peaceful if there were police patrols. “We are afraid to leave our homes in the morning because of these robberies and killings. Since this shooting, we have been even more terrified,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a murder case was opened at Umlazi Police Station. “At 5.45am, a woman on her way to work was attacked by unknown suspects.” Zwane said the woman was shot in the body and head.
