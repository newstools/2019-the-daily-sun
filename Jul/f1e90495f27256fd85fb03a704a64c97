“I WANT the municipality to pay for what they did to my son. They killed him and I want them to bury him.” This was what Banele Maji’s mum Thandiwe from Thabong, Welkom, said after the two-year-old drowned in a deep trench on Sunday. The 46-year-old said the municipality left the trench open for two weeks. “My kid went to play with his friends and a few minutes later, his friends came to tell me he was drowning. I rushed to the scene to find his father, Welinzima Mpinga, had already lifted him out.” “We rushed him to hospital but he was declared dead on arrival,” she said. “I want the municipality to bury him. “No one in the family is working and we survived on his grant.” Matjhabeng Municipality spokesman Kgojane Matutle said workers recently attended to a burst pipe in the area. “Investigations are under way to see why the hole was kept open and if barrier tape was put up to warn residents of the danger,” he said. “The municipality wishes to send its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane said an inquest docket was opened after a child fell into a drain at Jantoor Hostel. “Thabong police urge parents to know where their children are playing at all times. It’s important for young children to be under adult supervision at all times to ensure their safety,” she said.
