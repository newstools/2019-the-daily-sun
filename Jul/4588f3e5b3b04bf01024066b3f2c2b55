A FIRE that broke out at police flats on Saturday brought back traumatic memories for the family of Akhona Mzizi. The girl died at the age of six in 2017 after leaning against the door of a broken lift and falling down the shaft. It has emerged that since the tragedy, nothing has been done to repair the Herdershof Building in Sophiatown, Joburg. The building belongs to the public works department. Cops living in the building told Daily Sun very little maintenance was done. But it was still unclear what caused the fire, which destroyed three floors. Akhona’s dad, Sanele Mkhize (37), said he had temporarily moved out of his flat. “My wife is depressed and I’m also traumatised. It’s been difficult trying to come to terms with her death and nothing being done to fix the building,” he said. “The lifts are still not working but no alternative accommodation is being provided.” A cop said the fire extinguishers were empty and some flats were vandalised. Dauw Steyn, chairman of the Westdene-Sophiatown Residents Association, said: “The lack of maintenance and security has led to bad conditions. Things get broken without being fixed.” Public works department spokesman Thami Mchunu said the building was assessed yesterday. “A team will put together a report detailing what caused the fire and the steps to be taken.”
