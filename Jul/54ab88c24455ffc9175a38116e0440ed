Two Sebokeng police constables and two other men, who posed as police officers, have been arrested for allegedly trying to extort money from a Road Accident Fund beneficiary. The incident allegedly took place on Monday in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg. "The victim, who is a beneficiary of the RAF, was lured into a house by a woman who later attempted to engage him sexually. In the process, four men who identified themselves as police officers arrived and threatened to arrest him for rape. "He was then handcuffed and threatened to be detained in the Vaal. He was later promised that he could be released only if he paid a substantial amount of money," said police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini. Dlamini said the victim was saved by police officers who were patrolling in Randfontein after they spotted a vehicle driving recklessly in the area and stopped it. "An observant police officer, who was closer, quickly intercepted the vehicle - a white VW Polo with no registration numbers - and called for backup. The suspects were later arrested. Police are also looking for a woman who lured the victim into a house, where he was allegedly accused of rape," Dlamini said. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela welcomed the arrests and applauded the officers who arrested the suspects. "We are cleaning our house. It is better to remain with a few clean police officers than a bunch of criminals," said Mawela. The accused are expected to appear in the Krugersdorp Magistrate’s Court soon on charges of kidnapping, extortion and impersonating a police officer. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/two-real-cops-and-two-fake-cops-arrested-for-trying-to-extort-money-from-raf-recipient-20190730
