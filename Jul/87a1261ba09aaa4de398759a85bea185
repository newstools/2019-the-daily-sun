JOBURG Metro cops and paramedics have looked to a higher power following ongoing attacks on paramedics. Yesterday they gathered at Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Rockville, Soweto, and asked God to protect them against opportunistic thugs preying on emergency services workers. Acting EMS chief Rapulane Monageng said: “We are under siege. We are under attack from all corners.” He said they went to ask for help from the church as EMS workers were being attacked daily. “We have undertaken this campaign to go to church and ask communities to be with us. We believe we will be able to reach many communities through churches.” He said EMS responded to several emergencies, but opportunistic thugs who rob and assault them made it impossible for them to do their jobs. Monageng pleaded with communities to report such criminals at their nearest police stations. “Our firefighters and paramedics are working under fear,” he said. Following the recent attack in Diepsloot, Joburg Public Safety announced that Metro cops would now accompany emergency services workers to hot spot areas. Monageng said: “We haven’t had any incidents recently, meaning the message is going through to communities.”
