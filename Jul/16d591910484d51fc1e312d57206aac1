A taxi driver stopped on suspicion of being drunk, was found
carrying a police gun with its serial number filed off, Kagiso police said on
Monday. Police spokesperson Captain Solomon Sibiya said police
pulled the taxi over on Dulcie September street at about 01:10 on Sunday after
the driver skipped stop streets and drove recklessly. "The police pulled the taxi aside and conducted a
search, to both the vehicle and the driver who was allegedly intoxicated,"
said Sibiya. A case docket of unlawful possession of a firearm and
ammunition was opened at Kagiso police, and he was formally charged. He is expected to appear in the Kagiso Magistrate's Court
soon. The Kagiso Station Commander Brigadier Themba Maduna has
decided that these stop and search operations will be stepped up on routes like
Impala road next to Tshepisong, west of Johannesburg, and the R41 which cuts
through Witpoortjie and Kagiso. This followed hijackings of delivery vans, trucks and
motorists by people posing as law enforcement authorities. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/reckless-taxi-driver-found-with-police-gun-20190715
