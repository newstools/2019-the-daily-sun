 The African National Congress Secretary-General Ace Magashue has labelled ANC veteran Derek Hanekom as wedge driver and a charlatan. Magashule released the strong-worded statement late Wednesday night. It came after Hanekom's confession that he had several meeting with the Economic Freedom Fighters in Parliament to discuss a plan to oust Former President Jacob Zuma. EFF leader Julius Malema spilt the beans about how they met with Hanekom and SACP leader Solly Mapaila to get Zuma out of office on Tuesday outside the North Gauteng High Court. "The ANC is dismayed by its National Executive Committee member Derek Hanekom's confession that he did have several meetings with the opposition the EFF to indicate that he and other ANC MPs would support the EFF motion of no confidence last February against Former President Jacob Zuma," Hanekom said.Magashule said that the while the ANC is working on uniting members, Hanekom was a wedge driver. "Indeed this charlatan is making his mark through his ownership of the Ahmed Kathrada foundation," Magushule said.Magushule said that Hanekom has shown remarkable agility in his efforts to divide the ANC. "To him and other EFF sleepers in the ANC, this makes members of the NEC, PEC, REC and branches more determined to unite the ANC and deliver the services to the people of South Africa," Magashule said.
