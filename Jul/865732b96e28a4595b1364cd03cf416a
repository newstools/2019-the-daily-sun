THE secret to a long life is respecting your elders. This was what gogo Johanna-Fela Mthimunye (107) told the SunTeam at her younger sister Johanna-Ndazi’s 106th birthday party on Saturday. Johanna-Ndazi celebrated her special day in Ekangala, near Bronkhorstspruit in Tshwane, with her three kids, 16 grandkids, 22 great-grandkids and four siblings. The party was organised by her youngest daughter Elizabeth, who said she hoped her mum lived a long time so she could have more parties. She wanted to throw a huge party when gogo Johanna-Ndazi suffered a stroke when she turned 95. “I was scared my mum would die before I showed her how much I appreciated her, but with this party people can see how blessed we are,” she said. Elizabeth described her mum as a wise, gentle soul. Gogo Johanna-Fela, who turns 108 in December, said her parents always reminded them about the importance of respecting elders. However, she said, that was not the only reason she and her sister had lived such long lives. They always ate healthily, mostly vegetables instead of meat. She said they made sure they always had work to do and didn’t laze around. “Kids these days are lazy, and that’s why they get sick easily and die,” she said. “In our time we used to wake up early in the morning to fetch water, cook and clean the yard. “We didn’t have people doing these things for us.”
