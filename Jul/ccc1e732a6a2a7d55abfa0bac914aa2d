EFF leader, Julius Malema said the organisation is only scared of God. He was addressing his supporters gathered at the KaNyamazane stadium, in Mpumalanga during their 6th anniversary Malema said the EFF was not formed by the media, Zuma and the banks, but by the people. "You can destroy the EFF. No one can kill the EFF. We are only scared of God, we are not even scared of death. How can we be scared of Prison or SARS? How can we be scared of Pravin?" he  asked. He said people were skeptical about them and said it would be done after Zuma was gone but they are still standing. "Zuma is gone, Pravin will go. The same way we said Trollip will go, he is gone. The same way we said Gigaba will go, he is gone. The same way we said Nene will go, he is gone," he said. "Who knew that the ANC would have less than 60% one day? They said they would rule until Jesus comes but look at how their support is decreasing," he said. Malema said the 26 July Movement was inspired the Cuban Revolution. "We are the children of Fidel Castro. We are the children of Winnie Mandela. The same way that America failed to break Cuba, we too we will never be broken." He said they were here because they are continuing with the fight of their  ancestors. "Our ancestors will never rest in peace for as long as the white man walks this land and acts like they are the owners," he said. He also thanked the party's supporters for voting for  them. "Thank you for voting for the most progressive party, a party with no white advisors, a party that is an effective opposition, a party owned by black people and no-one can claim control over this political party," said Malema.
