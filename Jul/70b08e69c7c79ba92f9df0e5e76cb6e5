There’s a famous saying that says, “Revenge is a dish best
served cold”. This is true when it comes to people seeking and plotting
revenge on ex lovers. When lovers break up, most of the time, feelings of
betrayal, jealous and hurt take over which leave some people seeking revenge. We asked the Sun Family on Facebook to share with us some
interesting revenge stories they had plotted on their ex
boyfriends/girlfriends. Here what some had to say: Mukhethwa: I invited my ex boyfriend to my place and I pour
MUPESU on mageu. When I saw that he was ready to have sex I told him to go home
because my man is on the way. Malatji: I cheated on my girlfriend because she cheated on
me and guess what she is now HIV Positive Madimetja: I gave her Laxative pills and
sleeping pills at the same time at her place.
Guess what happened the following day LOL ??? Andrew: I stole and destroyed all her left feet shoes However, they are many people who don’t believe in seeking
revenge and letting life/karma and God deal with the person who wronged you. Gift: I believe God is the judge of everything because he
knows "right or wrong "...if somebody has done you wrong, then let
God avenge you. Joseph: Revenge is for God
