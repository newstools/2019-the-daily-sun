The MEC for Gauteng Community Safety Faith Mazibuko, is one
of the best MECs. This is according to Gauteng premier David Makhura. He said the good work she does as a member of Cabinet is
being ruined by the things she often says. Makhura was speaking on Talk Radio 702 this morning. He was responding to the opposition’s criticisms relating to
Mazibuko’s re-appointment into Cabinet, following her racial remarks during her
term as the MEC of sports. Mazibuko was called by Human Rights Commission to clarify
remarks attributed to her in an audio recording against staff members over
Combi Courts early this year. Mazibuko later apologised for her utterances. Makhura said: “This issue was dealt with by the Human Rights
Commission. The Commission have issued a report that they are satisfied with
the work they have done to interview her, and they don’t think that her entire
intentions were to target a particular racial group.” He said: “MEC Mazibuko is one of those people who work very
hard in my cabinet. She’s amongst the MECs that have no weekend. “Any task you assign to her, she carries it out with the
great deal of passion,” said Makhura. This is the second time Mazibuko is serving as the MEC for
Gauteng Community Safety, after she was first appointed in 2010. Makhura said she did exceptionally well at the time. He said: “It is in that era where policing in Gauteng
improved significantly. Police were everywhere in our province and I’m
confident that she will do a good job. “It doesn’t mean she doesn’t have mistakes. I said to her
that the good work that she does, gets undermined because every time she opens
her mouth, she often doesn’t think twice about what to say. But her actions
speak louder than her words,” added Makhura.
