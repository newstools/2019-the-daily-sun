The play The Fisherman tells the story of the challenges faced by black families. Based in a Nigerian village called Akure, brothers Ben and Obembe connect at a river where they used to fish and share painful stories of how their family split. Opening at the Market Theatre in Joburg on Friday, the play is directed by James Ngcobo and the brothers are played by Warren Masemola and Siyabonga Thwala, who also act as all the other characters. James told SunBuzz the play shows how families break up. “It touches strongly on what happens when distance affects a family’s structure. It’s about childhood, discovery and questioning. “When the brothers meet, they talk about the year that changed their lives as a family.” The show was inspired by the book by Chigozie Obioma, and James said they felt telling this story was important. “We encourage South Africans to watch Chigozie’s writing, because it’s important for people to watch works from the continent. “It’s the top-selling book by an African all over the world. We were blessed as the Market Theatre to get the rights to this play. “Chigozie’s writing has been compared to the work of great authors like Chinua Achebe and is very good. “It shows how black people around the world live. “This is why we decided to go with strong actors that would bring authenticity to Nigerian characters. We know they’ll play all of them perfectly.”
