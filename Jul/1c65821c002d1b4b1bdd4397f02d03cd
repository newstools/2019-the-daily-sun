THE MAN accused of murdering Pastor Sakhile Langa appeared in Durban Magistrates Court yesterday. But the attitude of Jabulani Mthethwa (51) angered the artists and pastors who came to oppose bail. These included gospel singers Thobekile Mkhwanazi, Sgwili Zuma and Phindile Phela and Ukhozi FM DJ, Irvin Sihlophe. Mthethwa was arrested in Point Road in Durban on Saturday for allegedly killing Langa. The pastor appeared on Mzansi Magic’s eHostela and often served as an MC at artists’ memorial services. Mthethwa is facing charges of murder, armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. When magistrate Vanitha Armu asked him whether he needed a Legal Aid lawyer or if he would arrange a private lawyer, he said he would think about it. Armu then asked him: “When are you going to think about it?” Mthethwa replied: “I don’t know, I am not okay.” After his response, the whole courtroom shouted at him in anger. But Mthethwa responded: “I wasn’t talking to you”. Pastor Vusi Dube said it was painful to see the accused showed no remorse. Langa family spokesman Thembinkosi Ngcobo said cops should fight against illegal firearms. He said the pastor’s memorial service will be held at eThekwini Community Church tomorrow. The funeral is on Saturday. “The first hour of the funeral will be held at the church and the second part at Sahara Kingsmead Stadium.” The matter was postponed.
