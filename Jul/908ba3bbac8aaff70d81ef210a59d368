TODAY is Internationa French Fries Day and the spotlight turns on French Fries. They’re enjoyed worldwide by fast food lovers. These days, you can enjoy them alone with salt, mustard or pickle for flavouring or with your favourite meal like a burger, beef steak, fried chicken or grilled fish. The history of the French Fries dates back to 1781. A Belgian journalist revealed that a family manuscript published that year featured a recipe for the fried potatoes. Eating potatoes was made popular in France by King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette, who apparently wore potato blossoms in their buttonholes and hair. Potatoes aren’t native to Europe. They most likely arrived when Spanish soldiers brought them back from Peru. One story is that the phrase “French Fried Potatoes” first appeared in English in 1856 in the cookbook, Cookery for Maids of All Work, by E Warren. Another story is that they were first called “French Fries” by American soldiers stationed in Belgium during World War I. After first tasting them, the Americans called them “French” fries as it was the official language of their fellow Belgian soldiers.
