Public Service and Administration Minister Senzo Mchunu and his Deputy Minister Sindi Chikunga recognized the hero antics of Johannesburg Metro Police Department Officer Lebo Mngomezulu in Parliament yesterday. Mngomezulu became an
instant midwife, helping a 28-year-old woman give birth on the side of the road
on the pavement at the intersection of Eloff and Village Road Selby in Joburg
CBD on the morning of 18 June 2019. The officer was
also commended by the Acting Head of Public Safety David Tembe for her
work. "I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to Minister Mchunu for
recognising our JMPD officer, as this will inspire all the staff of JMPD to
work even harder in order to achieve even greater success," Tembe said. Minister Mchunu
said, "I want to complement Metro Police Mchunu for her good work, and her
efforts place her in a position for a Batho Pele Award later this year." Mngomezulu works in
the Accident Unit of JMPD and has been a JMPD officer for 12 years.
