GOING to school on foot has turned into a terrifying experience for pupils in rural Vuwani, Limpopo. Three Tshimbupfe Secondary School girls aged between 16 and 18 were attacked in the bushes by two unknown men. The men threatened to kill them with pangas. Two of them were raped, while the third was used as a bed. The suspects took turns raping the two girls before fleeing the scene. The girls were on their way home from school at about 4pm last Tuesday. Education MEC Polly Boshielo said the pupils were taken to hospital for medical attention after the principal reported the matter to the police. “We’re calling on community members to come forward with information that may assist the police to arrest these suspects so that justice prevails,” she said. “It is shocking that those who should be protecting learners are the ones who prey on them. “All of us, working with the police, must leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the perpetrators are arrested and brought to book.” She said the department will send counsellors to the school. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident. He appealed to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact the nearest police station.
