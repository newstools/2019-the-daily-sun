DOMINIC Phala (53) claims there’s corruption at the Ekurhuleni police department. Phala, a unit head for anti-cable theft, claimed he was suspended after speaking out against corruption, nepotism and discrimination in the department. Phala, who’s fighting to clear his name, said he wanted a certain manager fired as he’s misleading the municipality. He said the manager didn’t implement arbitration awards against certain individuals and doesn’t review them. “I’m suspended because I raised these issues.” Phala was suspended on 8 March and said he was not given a chance to state his side of the story. Daily Sun contacted both the manager and Metro police chief Isaac Mapiyeye, who referred the People’s Paper to spokesman Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago. Kgasago said the issue started when Phala instituted legal proceedings against council, seeking to get payment for a dispute he allegedly won. The City of Ekurhuleni had decided to defend the matter. “A decision was to taken to institute disciplinary action,” said Kgasago.
