Nigeria legend Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha has explained why he
would have snubbed Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs had he
decided to come and play in South Africa. The former Paris Saint-German and Hull City midfielder,
instead, would have opted to play for Mamelodi Sundowns as he feels they would
best suit his playing style. “Well I think sometimes I’m brutally honest,
but I think the way I played it would have suited the way Sundowns plays. It’s
nothing against Pirates or Chiefs, but I think I would have been more
comfortable playing in a team that loves possession,” said Okocha at the Carling
Black Label Cup media update press conference in Pimville, Soweto on Monday. Okocha is an ambassador for the returning pre-season tournament. Chiefs and Pirates will renew their hostilities at FNB
Stadium on 27 July. Tickets are selling out for the eagerly anticipated clash,
with just 20 000 remaining. The voting lines for the starting line-ups will close on 23
July. Fans have been given more power this year with the introduction
of the “Game Changer” element. Out of the eight that were given as options, fans opted for Twitter
substitution, selecting the man of the match and selecting the captain.
