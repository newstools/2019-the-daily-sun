HE felt guilty that he killed his girlfriend. He tried to hide the secret, but the dead woman haunted him. He went straight to the police station to confess. The body of Nokubonga Mbatha (21) was found buried in a shallow grave at the boyfriend’s backyard in Agincourt Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, on 22 June. Her family in Wattville, Ekurhukeni, have finally found closure. “My granddaughter went to her boyfriend in February. He’d tell us Nokubonga never got to his place in Bushbuckridge,” said Mavis Mbatha (65). “He was acting as if nothing had happened. We’re happy that Nokubonga fought for herself.” Her body hasn’t been released to her family as cops are compiling a forensic report. Captain Sifiso Nyakane from Mhala Police Station in Mpumalanga said the suspect (21) appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court on 24 June. He will make his second appearance soon.
