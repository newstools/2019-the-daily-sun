NSIKA High School went up in flames on Friday. According to the KZN Department of Education, three of the seven classrooms of the school in KwaMpumuza, Pietermaritzburg, were burnt and the office of the school principal was broken into. There was apparently an attempt to break into the strong room where the computers and laptops are kept. However, nothing was stolen. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said the cause of fire was still unknown. “This is devastating. We are really lucky no one was hurt or injured. “I’m sure that over the next few hours and days, we will establish the cause of fire,” he said. Mshengu said the department has lodged an urgent investigation into the fire. He said when that was done, they should be able to determine what might have caused the fire. “We will work with the school and the residents to evaluate the extent of the damage caused by the fire,” said Mshengu. He said they have done everything they got to make sure teaching and learning could get back to normal as quickly as possible. “There is minimum disruption. We will work under the guidance of the emergency service,” said Mshengu.
