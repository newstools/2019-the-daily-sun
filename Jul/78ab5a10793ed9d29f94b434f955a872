DEVASTATED pre-school principal Tozama Joyi is pleading for help to rebuild their two-room structure, which was ripped apart by gale force winds on Wednesday. The Zweli pre-school in Mputi village in Bhaziya near Mthatha has 48 little pupils from the area. The school was built by community members. Joyi from Mputi Village said the wind damaged their furniture, school material and food. “I was told by a resident that the wind was blowing the roof away. “I rushed to the premises but the damage was already done. I’m not sure how we’ll get over this. I suspended classes. “We will have to ask neighbours to give us space.” Joyi said most families depend on grants and it will take them forever to rebuild the school if they didn’t get help. She has pleaded with anybody to please help them in any way they can. “We need the school to prepare the little ones for the future.” Nokwanda Mahlamvu (42), mother of a four-year-old pupil, said they were glad the kids were not at school when the wall fell over. She said when she went to inspect the damage she found the wall on the verge of collapsing. “I sent her to school because I wanted her to have a bright future. I’m so sad this happened.”
