COPPER thieves have been causing havoc in KwaZakhele kasi by stealing from substations and schools. Sipho Ndlambe (45), a resident of the Port Elizabeth kasi, said their power often went out. “On Monday morning, I woke up to find that my power was off. But it came back on at about 5.30pm,” he said. “Yesterday, I woke up again without electricity. This started happening after our substation was attacked on Sunday night. Criminals stripped the copper. “Last night, there was noise and a fire at the power station. I was afraid and switched off my mains.” Sipho said he contacted the municipality about the issue but they didn’t send anyone to fix it. “We are worried about our children and have told them not to go near naked copper wires.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki described the theft of copper cables as a wave of terrorism.
