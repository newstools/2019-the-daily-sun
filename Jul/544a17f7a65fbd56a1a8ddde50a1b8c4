THE Springboks have suffered a huge blow ahead of their Rugby Championship opener this weekend. The Boks will have to tackle the Wallabies at Ellis Park Stadium on Saturday without quicksilver winger Aphiwe Dyantyi who broke down with a hamstring injury in training. Bok assistant coach Matt Proudfoot has confirmed no replacement will be called for Dyantyi as they have sufficient cover in the squad. “Aphiwe injured his hamstring in training on Friday. He will see a specialist today to get an update on that,” said Proudfoot. “We will phase him back later in the tournament depending on what the specialist advises. “But he is definitely out for the start of the Championship.” Rassie Erasmus’s squad regrouped in Joburg on Sunday to continue preparations for the test against Australia. Erasmus will announce his match-day squad on Wednesday.
