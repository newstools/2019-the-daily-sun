GOGO Ipeleng Thaele (67) is happy  after SunPower got municipal officials to ensure her new house was built. Daily Sun published her story last Wednesday after President Cyril Ramaphosa had visited the gogo in November at Phahameng, Mangaung. The president had instructed Mangaung mayor Olly Mlamleli to build a new house for the poor gogo. Her crumbling house collapsed earlier this month. Ipeleng said human settlements officials visited her last week and she completed forms to get her new RDP. Mayor Mlamleli admitted she and Ramaphosa had visited Ipeleng. “But the municipality couldn’t build gogo’s house as she was fighting with her sister.” Ipeleng’s sister Emily Ramanamane (62) said there was no fight between them over a house. Ipeleng said the president had instructed the mayor, in front of her, to build a house for her but nothing had happened. “I’m grateful to Daily Sun for publishing my story,” she said. “Now local government will do as they were told by the president. “On Friday two women came to my place. They said they were from the Free State human settlements department. “We went to the police to verify my documents. I was told a new RDP would be built.” Free State human settlements spokeswoman Senne Bogatsu confirmed the visit. “Two officials from the department visited gogo Ipeleng at her house. She was helped to complete the forms for a new house.”
