WHAT started as a normal protest on Friday became a festival of crime. Roads were blocked and tyres were burned in Soweto, including Klipspruit and Protea Glen. Yesterday, cops confirmed a rumour that protesters raped a woman. Over 20 cars were damaged and others torched. Motorists had to avoid these parts as people protested over service delivery and power cuts. Catherine Moyo (41) said: “I had to make a fire outside. It’s cold. Power cuts are unacceptable. “We’re unhappy but we’re against people vandalising property and were shocked about the rape.” Vuyo Buthukutheli (40) said her Toyota was torched and her driver hurt. “Roads were closed and they were using Klipspruit Road when they were attacked. Windows were broken but passengers escaped before the car was set alight.” Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said: “Over 20 motorists were affected, including a 24-year-old woman who was raped on Klipspruit Valley Road. Cases are being investigated.” Eskom’s Dikatso Mothae said a faulty cable caused the outage. “We were working in the area but it became unsafe. We’ve continued.”
