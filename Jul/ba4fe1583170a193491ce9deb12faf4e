A PUPIL had to be rushed to hospital for smoke inhalation
after a fire in a classroom on Tuesday. According to a worker at Holele
High School in zone 2 of Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, the fire started after
school. A worker, who didn’t want to be identified, said: “There were
matric pupils still in class and two teachers were busy with orals. The
whole block was on fire and everything was burned. On that block there were two
HOD offices, two exam halls, three offices, a consumer studies hall and a
kitchen,” he said. The workers said everything was back to normal by
yesterday. Parents said although they were very sad about the damage done
to the school, they were very relieved no one was seriously
injured. Gauteng education department spokesman Steve Mabona said: “It’s
really concerning and unfortunate that we experienced such a loss. We are not
sure what caused the fire, however, an investigation has been launched.” Police
spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said only one pupil inhaled smoke. “The
cause was apparently burning grass outside the building and the fire spread.
The person who started the fire outside the school is unknown,” he said. Nkoadi
said a case of arson was opened and investigations were underway.
