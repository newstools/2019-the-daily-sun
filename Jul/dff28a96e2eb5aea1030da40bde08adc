Guests and staff members at the Mount Nelson Hotel in Cape
Town were robbed of their personal belongings when armed men entered the hotel
on Tuesday night, Western Cape police have said. "According to reports, 15 unknown men driving two
vehicles entered the gate. The security guard at the front gate access control
point was pointed [at] with a firearm and threatened," said Western Cape
police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. The guard was robbed of his baton and hand radio. Two of the
armed men remained with him inside his guard room. The two vehicles the men were travelling in - a white Toyota
Corolla and VW Polo - entered the premises, proceeded to the reception area and
seven men emerged, entering the hotel foyer. "They pointed at staff members and guests with two
firearms and robbed them of their personal belongings," said Van Wyk. Nobody was injured and there have been no arrests yet, he
said. The men then ransacked the foyer, breaking the glass cabinet
display windows with big hammers, while also removing jewellery and making off
with an undisclosed amount of money from the hotel cash register. "Police investigators have immediately activated a
multi-disciplinary action team and combed the crime scene area for any
evidence. Detectives are following up on all leads," Van Wyk added. Jocelyn Betts - the spokesperson for Belmond, the global
group which owns the hotel - confirmed the incident, but said operations at the
hotel were continuing as normal. She said an assessment would be done "to identify
whether any additional security measures can be implemented in light of this
incident". "The members of staff and our four guests affected are
safe and the hotel remains open as usual," Betts said. Betts added that she could not provide any more information,
as the investigation was now with the relevant authorities. Police have requested that anyone with information about the
incident contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or Cape Town Central SAPS. SOURCE: NEWS24
