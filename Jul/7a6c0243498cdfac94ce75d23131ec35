Gay activist and academic Cameron Modisane has come a long way since becoming one of the first people in Mzansi to have a gay traditional wedding in 2013. The 33-year-old and his partner have since gone their separate ways, but last week he was trending on social media again. This is because he earned a PhD in accounting sciences from North West University, something Cameron said he had wanted to do from an early age. Speaking to the SunTeam after his achievement, he said he wasn’t looking for love at the moment and just wanted to focus on his career. His advice to other young people is to know what you want and to go for it. “You need not give up because other people don’t believe in you,” he said. Last week Cameron wrote on Twitter that his mum was most excited about his graduation. He wrote: “A few years ago, some homophobic people close to my mum used to gossip and laugh that she had a gay son. “My mother never turned her back on me, despite the noise and hate from homophobes. She stood by me.” Cameron said he dedicated the research that earned him his PhD to his late father Boitumelo and wished he could have seen him graduate. Soon after news of his graduation broke, people took to social media to congratulate Cameron, who is also an active EFF member. Party leader Julius Malema retweeted his post.
