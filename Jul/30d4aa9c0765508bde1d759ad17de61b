THE outbreak of Ebola in the DR Congo has forced Mamelodi Sundowns to alter their pre-season plans. The Brazilians are back from Botswana where they had travelled for two friendly matches, and they had planned to move camp to the central African country. But they will now change route and travel to Zambia where they have two friendlies lined-up already. Pitso Mosimane’s charges had scheduled friendlies with Don Bosco and TP Mazembe, their opponents in the Caf Champions League. But with the number of cases passing 2 500 in Congo, the Ebola epidemic it reportedly by far the country’s largest-ever. And the club felt they can longer travel for safety reasons. “We are not travelling to Congo anymore due to the outbreak,” said acting Sundowns general manager Yogesh Singh. “The team are going to Zambia. We are playing Zanaco tomorrow and are still finalising plans for another opponent for a friendly on Saturday. We have several teams demanding to play against us. The Botswana tour has gone well, and we are happy with the progress as we prepare for the upcoming season.” It is not the first time the Tshwane giants go on a pre-season African Safari. It is certainly not a cheap exercise, but the team have reaped rewards. Singh has also emphasised the importance of such sojourns for a club regularly competing on the continent. “It’s an important excercise in a lot of ways and not only in terms of CAF travels. The new players are able to adapt to the conditions on the continent and also prepare them mentally. The PSL is also a challenging league and we’ve got to be thoroughly prepared for the season.” The team have signed four players, including Uruguayan striker, Mauricio Affonso and Tanzanian Habib Kyombo. But they are not yet done in the transfer market.
