TRADITIONAL healer Sibusiso Mathe (48) said he is a generous man and gives money to people who need it. Last Thursday, Mathe, from Makhaza in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, gave away money to listeners during his radio show to help them heal. He sometimes drapes himself in lots of cash, but not to show off. “It’s not about the money. The job I do is to heal the nation,” he said.    Mathe said he also spends R5 000 a day on food for his clients. “My workers braai meat and make bread and drinks for them because they start queueing here at 4am, long before I open. “I don’t want my clients to get confused because they are hungry,” he said.” Mathe said he healed almost anything, from ulcers to feelings. In his community radio slot, he asks questions related to his work. When listeners get it right, he showers them with money. “I spend more than R3 000 on the radio,” he said. “I don’t ask pastors about their work because my job is to provide services to everyone who visits my home.” He is originally from Durban. “I got this gift from my late grandfather. I don’t know why he chose me, but I’m glad he did.” He said he sold body lotion “to clean the skin” at R50, isiwasho Sentlahla yemali (medicine that helps bring money to business) at R150 and a soap for luck for R50.
