POOR quality work by municipal workers has left the owner of Crown Sports Bar frustrated. For four months, delivery trucks have been struggling to reach the bar in Uitenhage as Nelson Mandela Bay municipal workers left a huge hole in front of his driveway. Bar caretaker Mlamli Kuluba told Daily Sun: “The problem started in March after there was a leaking water pipe in the driveway. They came to fix it but never closed the hole. I’m scared of closing it myself. I don’t want to damage the water pipes.” Mlamli said he’d been in and out of municipal offices reporting the problem. “I’ve reported it four times. Municipal officials just promised to send people to fix it, but I’ve been waiting since March,” he said. “This is a bar and casino, but vehicles are struggling to get in and out. I want the municipality to close and cement this hole.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said he’d refer the matter to the relevant department for investigation.
