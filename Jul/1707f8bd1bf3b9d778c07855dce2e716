Members of the Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) were called out to the home, after the homeowner found their dog attempting to kill the snake. During the fight the snake was injured, and the dog was bitten. RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram said professional snake catcher Jason Arnold of Universal Reptiles was called to the home and he removed the highly venomous snake from the home Balram said the dog died a short while later. “The snake measuring nearly 2.5 meters was also seriously injured after its spine was crushed,” Balram said.
