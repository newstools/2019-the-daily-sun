GAUTENG MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi has raised the hopes of staunch Moroka Swallows supporters ONCE AGAIN, when he announced Coca Cola as "one of" their OFFICIAL sponsors. Swallows, one of South Africa's darlings after Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs, suffered a major setback when they were relegated to the NFD, later dropped to the ABC Motsepe League and ultimately to the regional leagues. But Lesufi has always been firm about his undying support for Swallows and has made a vow to their fans: "We will get Swallows back to the PSL". The leadership of the club held their annual general meeting in May where they agreed on trying bids to fast track the return of the club back to the PSL. SunSport even reported that the leadership of the club are willing to even come back through the NFD, and work their way up. When Lesufi announced the soft drink company as their new backers via Twitter, there was a strong reaction with many complementing him. But he responded: "We are getting there." Another supporter asked where would the club be campaigning next season, and he responded: "Letâ€™s get sponsors and funds first then sort out the league. "We must not rush. We will announce that part later on." Swallows have been rumoured to be interested in purchasing status of either Free State Stars or even Bloem Celtic have also been mentioned. Stars are back to the NFD after being relegated in the past season, while Celtic are financially troubled and need financial help, and they have been public that they would like to see. But the stumbling block is that Free State people, especially those in Bloemfontein do not want the club to be moved anywhere outside their city.
