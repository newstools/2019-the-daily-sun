RADIO fans were excited when they saw a picture on social media of DJ Fresh posing with Kaya FM managing director Greg Maloka. The photo was posted on Greg’s Instagram account. It showed the two sitting at a table with a document in front of them, and pens in their hands. The photo sparked rumours that the Metro FM breakfast host would be joining the independent radio station after his troubles with the SABC. But Greg said the rumours were untrue. “It was just a picture. I’ve known Fresh for over 20 years, and we’ve taken lots of pictures together.” He said the photo was taken in Durban where they were hosting the annual DJs United music conference. “Currently there are no negotiations about Fresh joining the station, but if anything changes, you guys will be the first to know,” he said. SABC spokeswoman Vuyo Mthembu said she could confirm Fresh had been found guilty by the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa of using offensive language on air. She said she could also confirm he was expected to return to the airwaves next Monday. “It is unfortunate he’s giving the impression he does not know what is going on when the SABC has been communicating with him in this regard.”
