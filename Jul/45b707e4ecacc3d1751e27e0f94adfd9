Top Afro soul singer Siphokazi will headline an exclusive, star-studded concert on Women’s Day to celebrate women and bring hope to Mzansi’s unemployed youth. The unique, per-invitation-only Up Close and Personal with Siphokazi concert,to be staged at an undisclosed venue on 9 August, will also feature legends such as Yvonne Chaka Chaka, Bheki Khoza and Khaya Mahlangu, among others. Music fans who want to watch the show can live-stream it online on www.siphokazishow.com Tickets cost R450. The event is organised by the South African Digital Content Organisation, in partnership with Sollywood Events. Co-organiser and spokesman for both companies, Mbuyiselo Stemela, said the idea was sparked by Mzansi’s alarming unemployment rate , especially among the youth. He told SunBuzz: “We had to do something to help lower the stats. We came up with an idea to train and hire youth in careers in the fourth industrial revolution space.” We’ve started training about 1 000 young people from Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KZN and Eastern Cape. We aim to train 5 000 young people across the country through proceeds raised at the Women’s Day event.” He said he was confident the concert would attract interest among music lovers. “We know lot of people would be prepared to pay good money to watch a music icon like Siphokazi perform. That’s why we’re doing this concert. We also want to celebrate women, black excellence and black music, hence we chose Siphokazi,” Mbuyiselo said. Siphokazi, the Amacala hitmaker, said she was excited and proud to be part of the event. “I feel honoured they chose to partner with me,” said Siphokazi, whose full name is Siphokazi Mohapi. “ I believe I am, through my music, a catalyst for education. That’s why I’m happy I’ll be helping the youth of South Africa get closer to their dreams.”
