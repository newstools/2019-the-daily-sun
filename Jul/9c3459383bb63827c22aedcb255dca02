Police
Minister Bheki Cele revealed on Sunday that five officers had been arrested in
special operations which commenced three days ago in crime-ridden areas of Cape
Town.  He
added that 141 suspects had been arrested since the deployment in Philippi this
week.  "All
spheres of life have rotten apples... but we are working on that [in the
police]," he said at a provincial crime summit in Paarl.  Cele
said the approach to fighting crime couldn't only be a police matter and called
on various departments to assist.  The
departments of social development and correctional service were among those
attending the summit.  Cele
engaged with residents of Philippi East early on Sunday, where 11 people were
shot and killed last week. It is one of the areas where the South African
National Defence Force will be deployed.  He
said that there had been numerous requests from Community Policing Forums for
the army to be deployed.  The
minister announced on Thursday in his budget speech that President Cyril
Ramaphosa had given the go-ahead for the SANDF to offer support to the police
and enter 10 identified areas on the Cape Flats.    https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/cele-vows-to-clamp-down-on-rotten-cops-as-5-officers-are-arrested-in-cape-town-operation-20190714
