LAND grabs remain a big headache in Mzansi. Self-appointed community leaders in Lawley, south of Joburg, are selling plots on vacant land for R500. The area became a kasi in just one weekend. Some were still buying stands and the SunTeam discovered yet another piece of land would be up for grabs. When Daily Sun approached the land sellers, they said they were doing what’s right for the people. But a man named Lebo on Saturday denied he was selling land. Homeseeker Khehla Nzimande (40) said: “The best thing to do is to get a piece of land and stay there so we can move into houses by the time they give them to us. “I bought this piece of land for R500 from a man named Lebo. He allocated stands to us and said we may build shacks.” But human settlements spokesman Tahir Sema condemned the land grabs. “According to information available to the department, the land in question is not owned by the Gauteng government.” Sema said stealing government or privately owned land and property was a criminal act. “We call on law enforcement agencies and the justice system to take action against those who commit this crime,” Sema told the People’s Paper.
