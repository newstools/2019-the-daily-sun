LOVING, focused
and dedicated… those were some of the words used by mourners to describe the
late Mandla Maseko! The
memorial service of Mandla Maseko also known as 'Space-boy’ was held in
Swartzkop Military Air force base in Tshwane. The 30-year-old
man from Mabopane in north of Tshwane, died in motorbike crash on Saturday
night. His death
shocked many people in Mzansi and across the world. Family,
friends and colleagues came to pay tribute to the man who was set to become the
first black African man to go space. Maseko
earned the name 'Space-boy', after beating 1 million people to become one of 23
people bagging a seat on an hour-long sub-orbital space trip. Every
speaker that came to share their moments with him used the word blessing to describe
him. They shared
their greatest memories they had with him.  His
childhood friend, Keolebogile Bopape, said he has lost not just a friend but a
brother too. He said
Mandla was the only person he shared his secretes with. “I was the
first person he told about him winning the competition to go to space, he
shared everything with me, and I did the same.” “This is
not a goodbye for me but ‘a till we meet again’.  “I know he
will visit me again in my dreams, he will tell me things,” he said. Mandla’s Colleague
and also a friend, Maite Makgoba, shared the last days she spent with him. She said a
day before his death, Maseko was in a happier mood. “On Friday
when I spoke to him, he was just excited about life.  “He was
telling me that he wants to marry his girlfriend, he even told me about his
wedding, he loved doing the right thing,” she said The
honorary colonel, Yvonne Chaka Chaka-Mhinga, also shared some words of comfort
to Maseko’s family. She
described him as hardworking man, who was focused and dedicated.  “As young
as he was, he had accomplished more in his life time, he was the hope for South
Africa,” she said. Maseko will
be laid to rest in Mabopane north of Tshwane on Saturday.
