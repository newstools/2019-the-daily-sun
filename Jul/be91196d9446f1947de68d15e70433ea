LERATO Moreki (36) said she has nightmares after she saw her daughter dying in front of her eyes. Bohlale Moreki (6) was hit by a speeding car on the busy Moshoeshoe Street in Rocklands, Mangaung, on Tuesday. The grieving mum said her daughter now comes to her in her sleep, asking her to buy her a cake for her birthday, which would have been on Sunday. She told Daily Sun she was at home when she noticed her daughter hadn’t come back from playing with her friends across the road. “I went outside and called her to come home. She came towards me and then a speeding car came out of nowhere and hit her, leaving her lying on the side of the road.” “I ran towards her and tried to wake her up, but it was too late. She took her last breath in my arms.” Lerato said she was planning on buying her daughter a frozen cake, because she did very well at school. “She said she wanted to be a doctor.” Lerato said: “Had the driver not driven off, we could’ve taken her to hospital immediately. He came back later, but it was already too late.” She said it hurt her to see her child’s killer on the street. Police spokesman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi told the People’s Paper: “A case of culpable homicide, failure to stop after an accident, and driving without a licence has been opened. A 23-year-old was arrested.” Hlubi said the suspect will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court today.
