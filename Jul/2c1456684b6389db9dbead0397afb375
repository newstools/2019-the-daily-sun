Orlando Pirates have acceded to Caio Marcelo's request to be released from his contract. The Brazilian defender cited home sickness and inability to adjust to his new surroundings as reasons to want to return back to Brazil, in a letter written to the club. “The Club has since acceded to Mr Marcelo's request, having spoken to the player and his father. We would like to wish him the best in his future endeavours,” said the club.
