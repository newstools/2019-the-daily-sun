FOR more than a year, grade 12 pupil Siyanda Nyovana took care of his ill mum, bathing her and changing her nappies. But two weeks ago his mum, Neliswa, died. Now the 20-year-old from Philippi, Cape Town, is pleading for help to bury her. “I want her to be buried properly so my younger brother and I can visit her grave. I’ve been stressing about how we’re going to bury her,” said Siyanda. For the past two weeks his neighbours have been trying frantically to put money together. Only R10 000 has been collected so far. “We’ve been assisting Siyanda and his 10-year-old brother for the past few months while their mum was bedridden,” said Nomathemba Qwebe. “We’ll keep on trying but we’re still a long way off,” Nomathemba said. Siyanda said burying his mother would allow him to focus on his books and pass matric so he can realise his dream of being a teacher. Moipone Sam, the principal of Intsebenziswano High School, where Siyanda is a pupil, said the young man had gone through a lot. “I used to punish him for being late but then a parent told me about his situation at home,” said the principal. “The situation was too much for him. He even changed his mother’s nappies before coming to school. This affected him badly,” Sam said. Anyone who can assist is asked to call social worker Zimkitha Ndinga on 063 606 3921.
