A 15-year-old boy and
24-year-old man have been arrested for allegedly raping and beating a woman to
death in Prieska, Northern Cape police said on Monday. The woman, identified as
33-year-old Vanessa Barends by the Diamond Fields Advertiser (DFA), had been
walking home over the weekend when the pair attacked her, said Captain
Olebogeng Tawana. "[They] accosted and
dragged her into a nearby yard [and] took turns raping her." A passerby spotted her
lying "helplessly, half-naked and brutally assaulted", he said. "She had head
injuries. We are investigating what object was used." Tawana said Barends had
died while receiving medical treatment. Her uncle, Booi BJ Barends,
told the DFA that, after she disappeared, they had decided to go to the Bill
Pickard Hospital, where they found her. He said they hardly recognised her
because her head was so swollen. He told the newspaper that
the family had been optimistic that she would recover, but she died from her
injuries on Sunday. The police followed up on a
lead and members of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences
Unit arrested two men, Tawana said. They were expected to
appear in the Prieska Magistrate's Court on charges of rape and murder on
Monday. SOURCE: NEWS24
