Mexican drug lord Joaquin  “El Chapo” Guzman has been sentenced to life in jail in the Unites States. CNN reports that today a judge in New York ordered El Chapo to pay $12.6 billion to the US government, a conservative estimate of his profits in the US, and serve a life sentence plus 30 more years. He is said to have made nearly $14 billion as the decades long head of the murderous Sinaloa cartel. The 62 year-old Mexican is said to be the former leader of his country’s Sinaloa drug cartel. In February this year El Chapo was found guilty of 10 criminal charges against him including murder conspiracies, running a continuing criminal enterprise and other drug-related charges. CNN said El Chapo spoke in the courtroom before the sentencing saying that being jailed was "physical, emotional and mental torture" and "the most inhumane situation I have lived in my entire life." But the state believes justice has been served saying El Chapo won't be able to "pour poison over our borders.
