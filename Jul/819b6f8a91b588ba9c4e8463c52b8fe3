HE loved his girl and would have done anything for her. But HARRY Mabube said he ended up being attacked by his partner of five months and her lover! The 33-year-old from Marikana in Cullinan, Tshwane, was left with a broken heart and a scar on his head. HARRY said the trouble started on 28 March when he got a call from an unknown number. When he answered his lover was on the line and she started insulting him. HARRY then went to her house to talk to her. “She laughed at me and said she’d never called me. “I went outside. She followed me and threw a rock at me.” He said the woman got a pair of scissors and tried to stab him. “Her lover came and hit me on the head. Before I knew it I was being attacked by both of them.” He went to the cop shop but claims no arrests were made. Warrant Officer Johan van Dyk said an arrest was made for assault. “The docket is at court for trial.” He advised Harry to aproach the station commander.
