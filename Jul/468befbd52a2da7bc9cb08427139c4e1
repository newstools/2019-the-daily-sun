THE taxi business in most cases is associated with violence. In a recent incident, a taximan’s family north of Durban was left with many questions. Three of their taxis and a truck were torched last Wednesday. The vehicles were parked in their yard in Newlands West when the incident happened. Family member Sfundo Hlophe (24) said they were called out by a neighbour. “We came out to find the fire was already burning out of control and our attempts to fight the flames failed,” he said. Sfundo said the business belonged to his dad Jabulani, who wasn’t home when SunTeam visited the family. He said his father was very upset. “We’ll deal with the matter after the funeral,” said Sfundo. Daily Sun tried to contact Jabulani several times, but his phone rang unanswered. Durban Liners Taxi Association was not available for comment. Santaco chairman S’fiso Ntshangase said: “We haven’t been made aware of this incident, so we can’t comment.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane told the People’s Paper: “Police were notified about the incident, but no case was opened.” Zwane advised the taximan to open a case.
