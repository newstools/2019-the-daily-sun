UNDERFIRE and disgraced Zimbabwe goalkeeper, Elvis Chipezeze, says he has been advised not to entertain or even respond to reports spreading like wildfire accusing him of having sold his country to DR Congo at the ongoing Afcon in Egypt. He conceded four easy goals against the Congolese that paved the way for them and the  Warriors eliminated from the competition. The Baroka goalie stood in for injured Edmore Sibanda  and George Chigova. Said Chipezeze on Thursday when the news broke via a Madagascar media: "I'm not going to respond to anything. I know it doesn't look good for my image, but for now I'm not going to say anything. "Time for me to talk will come." The reports from Madagascar claims that the 29-year-old Chipezeze could have been bought by the Congolese, but if this is proven to be true, it might end his football career. But at this stage, with investigations apparently underway, Caf has been mum on the matter. The report suggests that it is high unlikely the Congolese would be allowed to play their round of 16 match against Madagascar on Sunday, “and could either be replaced by the Warriors, who in turn will be handed a 3-0 scoreline, or the Ocean Islanders could be handed a walk over into the quarter finals”.
