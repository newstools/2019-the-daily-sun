The
Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga says they are working on
eradicating all unsafe toilets in school in the next three years. Speaking to
the media ahead of her budget vote at Parliament in Cape Town, Motshekga said:
“By the end this financial year, we will complete the construction of 40
schools and to deliver sanitation to 775 schools and water 225 schools.” The number
of schools to be provided with sanitation includes 606 schools. The
director general of the department Hubert Mweli said the department will spend
R700 million on sanitation this financial year, R800 million in 2020 to 2021
financial year and R1,3 billion will be spend in the 2021/2022 financial year. Motshekga
said they are working hard to ensure that they finish the project before three
years. She said
there is a need to expedite the processes: “School infrastructure provision
remains a contentious matter that requires agility, innovation for effective
delivery to accelerate the achievements that have already been registered.” Incidents
of kids falling in pit latrines have caused outrage in recent years. Five years
ago, Michael Komape from Mahlodumela Primary School in Limpopo fell in a
toilet, and Lumka Mthethwa a grade R from Luna Primary School in Bizana in
Eastern Cape is one of the recent victims.
