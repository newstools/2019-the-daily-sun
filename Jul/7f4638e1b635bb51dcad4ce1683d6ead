PERCY Tau will spend another season out on loan in Belgium, this time with Club Brugge. The Brighton and Hove star’s failure to obtain a work permit in the United Kingdom means he still can’t join the Premier League outfit this season. Tau, who played in the Belgian second division with Royale Union Saint-Gilloise last season, will now be making a step up to the top flight. He will play in the Belgian Jupiler League with Brugge and is set to get a taste of UEFA Champions League action. Brugge announced Tau’s arrival on social media on Monday, writing:“Club reached an agreement with Brighton & Hove Albion about the loan of attacker Percy Tau.” Brighton are hoping Tau will use the opportunity out on loan to further develop before joining the Premier League soon. “This is a great move for Percy. It’s a step up to the next level in Belgium, and he also has the prospect of Champions League football," said Brighton’s technical director Dan Ashworth on the club’s website. “It comes off the back of an impressive African Cup of Nations campaign with South Africa, and will give Percy the opportunity to further develop his undoubted talent.”
