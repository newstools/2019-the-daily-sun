The late Motsweding FM commentator Cebo Maanyapelo - may his soul Rest In Peace - would get carried away and scream “The Sensational” whenever the ball reached the feet of Sipho Nunens. When Nunens arrived at Mamelodi Sundowns, the peroxide-blond young dribbling wizard had the arrogance of an experienced superstar. At that tiny age, he was already christened with nicknames such as “Midfield Genius” and “The Sensational”. The world was his oyster and the Brazilians die-hard supporters loved him to bits. He was touted to revive and bring back the memories of “Shoe-Shine Piano” because he had incredible dribbling tricks and ball control. He bossed and owned the midfield like a man possessed. It was in the late 1990s and he was the next big thing in Mzansi diski. But a lifestyle of partying, girls, drinking and the bright lights of Jozi cut short a very promising career. Nunens did not fulfil his potential and ended up club hopping without a purpose. He was even mentioned in the Bad Boys of SA Soccer alongside the likes of Naughty Mokoena, Junior Khanye, Brendon Augustine, Skaapie Malatsi to mention a few. Nunens has a SAFA Level 1 coaching certificate and was at some point training the youth at an academy in Carletonville in 2014. What do you remember the most about “The Sensational” Sipho Nunens?
