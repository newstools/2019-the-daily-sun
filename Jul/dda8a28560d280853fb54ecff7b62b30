Former President Jacob Zuma's testimony enters its third day at the State Capture of Inquiry. The former president promised on his first day at the Zondo Commission in Parktown, Joburg that he would make startling revelations and promised to drop bombshells. Zuma is today expected to give his response to the testimony of Former Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan. Hogan previously told the commission that Zuma insisted on appointing Siyabonga Gama as head of Transnet, despite him facing misconduct charges and against the recommendation of the company's board.
