ZUMA supporters in KZN are calling on government to beef up his security after he claimed there was a plot to kill him. He told the Zondo Commission on his first day of testimony that his personal assistant received a call from an unknown person who asked her to tell him that he would be killed. Andile Hlatshwayo, chairman of Ubumbano Lokuthula in KZN, said they were worried about Zuma’s safety. He said his supporters will hold government accountable if anything happens to him. “We are not shy to be called Zuma supporters. We always knew his life would be in danger after his testimony where he revealed the names of the people who sold out other comrades in exile. It is government’s duty, or the commission, to protect witnesses,” said Hlatshwayo. Another strong Zuma supporter, Nkosentsha Shezi, said he was also worried about Zuma’s safety. He said he hoped the commission would do something to protect Zuma. Shezi, who is also a leader of a radical transformation group, organised more than 10 buses from the province to support Zuma when he appears at the commission.
