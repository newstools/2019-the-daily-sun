Versatile singer and actress Winnie Khumalo is celebrating 31 years in the music industry in grand style. The gifted artist, who in her outstanding career has worked with producer Sello “Chicco” Twala, the late Brenda Fassie and kwaito group Bongo Maffin, will release a song that seeks to inspire women. The timing of the release of   iXesha , which features CandiSonic and DJ Wisani, is significant. On 9 August, Mzansi will celebrate Women’s Day. This is the day women will reflect on past struggles and achievements, and reassert their roles in shaping society. The title of Winnie’s new song, iXesha,  Xhosa for “time”, could also not have been more apt. Winnie said it was time women took control of what they believed in. In the song, women are reminded of their power in society. Speaking to SunBuzz, the Live My Life hitmaker encouraged women to be strong and resilient. “It’s about time we take our power back and live without fear of being told we should behave in a certain way for society to accept us. “This song is not about relationships but a woman’s position in society. In my years in the music game, I’ve seen things happening around me that forced me to appreciate myself more as a woman,” she said.
