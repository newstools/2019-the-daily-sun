JOBURG mayor Herman Mashaba surprised his twitter followers. This is after the mayor shared a video playing a keyboard. Mashaba appears to know what he was doing and had the crowd cheering on him. Even though some of his followers were not impressed by his music talent, some thought the mayor will certainly have a career in music should his political career end. You be the judge.
