Mr Deaf South Africa Phumelela Mapukata has arrived home in Cape Town after being crowned the winner at the world pageant. Twenty contestants from 11 countries competed for the title of Mr and Miss Deaf World in Mpumulanga on Friday. It’s the first time the pageant has taken place in South Africa. Phumelela, who was crowned Pubic Choice Winner in 2017, was subsequently elected to represent Mzansi. Miss Deaf South Africa Lethiwe Ntaka was crowned first runner-up. The both arrived at OR Tambo on Monday, following their success at the pageant. Phumelela (24), who lives in Mitchells Plain, said he prepared for the pageant by playing sport and getting in shape. “Communication was a real challenge as every country has its own sign language,” he said when asked about the challenges he faced during the pageant. When his name was called, he said he was shocked and at a loss for words, as he did not expect to win. “I want to be a role-model for kids and be someone others can look up to during my reign as Mr Deaf World,” he said. Phumelela shared a message with the deaf community, saying: “It doesn’t matter where you’re from or what your circumstances are, you can unexpectedly rise to the top like I did if you work towards your goals.” – CHANNEL24
