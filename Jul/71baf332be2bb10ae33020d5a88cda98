FORMER Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns striker Edward Manqele is set to join National First Division (NFD) outfit Royal Eagles. The Randfontein-born player started training with the Durban-based side on Monday after an invitation from head coach Joel Masutha. And yesterday, Masutha told SunSport that he has been impressed by the once highly rated and former Bafana Bafana player and he could sign him today. The 32-year-old was playing for NFD side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila last season and helped them qualify for the promotion/relegation play-offs. But Tshakhuma failed to gain promotion to the top flight. Maritzburg United, who finished 15th in the Absa Premiership, won the play-offs to retain their PSL status. “He is the right player who can help us achieve our goal of winning promotion,” said the former Black Leopards and Chippa United coach. Masutha also revealed that former Highlands Park striker Moeketsi Sekola is also training with them. “Sekola is with us and he is also doing well,” said Masutha. “Let’s see what transpires this week. We need experienced players who have played in the NFD and won promotion, or helped their team to reach the play-offs.” Masutha is also expecting former Leopards captain Jean Munganga to join his team this week. Munganga was released by Lidoda Duvha at the end of last season. Masutha has worked with the 33-year-old DRC Congo-born player while he was in charge of Leopards and helped them returned to the top flight, with Munganga playing an important role. Munganga spent six seasons with Leopards after signing in 2012 from Congolese side FC Saint Eloi Lupopo.
