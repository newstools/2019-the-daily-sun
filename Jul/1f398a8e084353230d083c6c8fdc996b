THREE cash-in-transit heist robbers were sentenced to over 30-years
in jail. Zukile Vimbela (41), Mfana Selby Gomba (33) and Bulelani
Luningo (37) were sentenced for a robbery committed at a Capitec bank in East
London in 2016. In 17 September 2016, security guards from G4S security
company were about to offload cash from their vehicles into a bank when about
six armed men confronted them with firearms and disarmed them. Thereafter, they stormed into a Capitec Bank, forced staff
and security guards into the bank vault, locked them inside the vault and then
fled with approximately R1.6 million. Gomba and Luningo were arrested in Cape Town two days after
the heist by Gugulethu SAPS members. Police spokesperson Captain Anelisa Ngcakani said they were
bust for unlawful possession of firearms; a pistol and a revolver.
Investigations positively linked the pistol as one of the firearms which was
robbed from the G4S security guards. On Friday, the East London Regional court sentenced Vimbela
to 10 years imprisonment for armed robbery. Ngcakani said Gomba was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment
for armed robbery, 30 years for possession of two unlicensed firearms and 5
years for possession of ammunition. Luningo received 20 years’ imprisonment for armed robbery,
30 years for possession of two unlicensed firearms and five-years for
possession of ammunition. The sentences of Gomba and Luningo will run concurrently,
Gomba will serve 25 years direct imprisonment whilst Luningo will serve 30
years.
