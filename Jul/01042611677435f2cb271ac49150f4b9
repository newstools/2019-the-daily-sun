ANGRY parents picketed outside Nomsa Mapongwana Primary School yesterday. The said they were gatvol of crime after a recent incident at the school in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, where teachers were robbed at gunpoint. SGB member Nkululeko Ntetha said the teachers were in a meeting when three thugs arrived. “The caretaker let them in because they said they were there to see one of the teachers,” he said. Nkululeko said the caretaker took them to the principal and the thugs stole his phones. “Before reaching the principal’s office, they met the secretary and took laptops and phones. On their way out, they ran into a teacher and took her to the staff room where more than 30 of her colleagues were gathered. They took everything,” he said. Nkululeko said the education department had not done anything to help but Sadtu sent people to counsel the victims. “We are fed up. We need action now. We are lucky no one was killed. The department needs to look into security at this school.” Ntsiki Dlulani from Equal Education said safety at the school was a huge concern. “The school has been asking the department to fix the fence, train the security guard and put up CCTV cameras,” she said. Western Cape education spokeswoman Bronagh Hammond said the employee wellness programme had conducted a debriefing session with staff, and safety measures would be looked into.
