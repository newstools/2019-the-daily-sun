WHEN Tebogo Mogotlane (64) wouldn’t let ANC comrades use his shack to campaign during the election two months ago, he didn’t think to expect the worst. Tebogo, from Moletlane section in Zebediela, Limpopo, is an Azapo member. He said he had connected his water supply pipe to the local tribal office before experiencing water cuts. He said he reported the water cuts to the local councillor Mahlako Masemola. But his struggle to get water continues. “They didn’t ask for my permission to use my shack. They just occupied it and started campaigning “My pipe was connected before then, but soon after I argued with them, it was disconnected,” he said. He said other residents all have running water and only his taps are dry. But Masemola said there was a water shortage in the area and repairs were taking place at the water plant. “Everyone has water, including him. During the election he had differences with other comrades but the issue was resolved,” he said.
