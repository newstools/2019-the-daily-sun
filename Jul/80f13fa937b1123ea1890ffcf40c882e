TV Presenter Luyanda Potwana is undoubtedly Mzansi’s top rated TV Presenter but his paycheck says something different. Whenever the TV ratings come out, reality show, Nyan Nyan is always on top but he seems to be the least appreciated. The NyanNyan presenter spoke out on being the highest rated TV presenter but not the highest paid! Media commentator Phil Mphela recently touched on the subject of ratings not always translating into money and used Luyanda’s case as an example. In response, Luyanda confirmed that he was definitely not the most paid TV presenter despite having arguably the biggest show on TV. “I’m definitely not. In fact…I’m far from it!!,” he revealed. Whilst the show racks in numbers every evening and trends on social media, its presenter is definitely not happy with the racks.
