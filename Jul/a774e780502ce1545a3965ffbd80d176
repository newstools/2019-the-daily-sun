MPUMALANGA Economic Development MEC Pat Ngomane has urged leaders and members of the public to make use of township tourism establishments. Tabling his budget and policy speech in the Mpumalanga legislature in Mbombela on Tuesday, he said SMMEs needed the public’s support to be sustainable. “We have tourism jewels in our rural areas and townships that are 100% black-owned. “Let’s make use of them instead of booking accommodation in towns. “The survival and growth of these facilities depends squarely on our support,” he said. Ngomane said the provincial government would assist township and rural tourism projects to find markets and to provide them with skills. Importantly, Ngomane said, his department would soon develop a provincial rural tourism plan. “Rural tourism is an important aspect in the sustainability and livelihood of rural areas. “The plan will unearth all the tourism opportunities that can be exploited to improve the socioeconomic conditions of the people of Mpumalanga,” he said. The department also plans to revive dilapidated township establishments. A total amount of R395 million had been set aside to help develop the tourism sector in the province.
