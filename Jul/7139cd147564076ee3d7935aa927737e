CONTROVERSIAL maskandi artist Mthandeni Manqele has said his biggest wish is to take on the late Mgqumeni Khumalo’s dancers. But his wish is unlikely to come true. Dancers Jaiva Zimnike and Mkholwane Langa threatened to give Mthandeni a hot klap when they meet him. They were angry after he told Daily Sun they were struggling. Mthandeni said: “I’ll not keep quiet while I see them struggling. I loved Mgqumeni and I love them. “I’ve managed to get Shilisi Langa, who was the leader of the Mgqumeni dancers, and I’ll get Jaiva and Mkholwane.” Jaiva told the SunTeam Mthandeni’s comments were an insult. “I’m not a man of many words, and I don’t want to be provoked. This boy was clueless when he started out in the industry. “I helped him and taught him to play the guitar, and now he’s disrespecting me. A hot klap is loading.” Mkholowane said he won’t be disrespected by a young boy. “He’ll get a hot klap because he’s provoking us while we’re focusing on our music careers. We’re not struggling,” he said. Mgqumeni died in 2009. His dancers went on to became musicians in their own right.
