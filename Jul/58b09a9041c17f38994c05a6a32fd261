RESIDENTS in Obama squatter camp, Khayelitsha, Cape Town are paying more than R30 to borrow their neighbours’ toilets. Makhosonke Jiko (37) told Daily Sun that they don’t have a toilet and said it’s costing them. “We have to think before going to our neighbour’s toilet because we can’t use them for free,” said Jiko. He went on to say that some charge them R30 a time while others charge R50 if they want the use of the toilet for the whole day. “We want the City of Cape Town to help us with toilets because we can’t carry on like this,” Mandisa Veco (53) said, “When these politicians wanted our votes they promised us toilets but until now we haven’t seen them. Instead we are paying money to relieve ourselves. “When we eat we are careful because we don’t want to visit the toilet often otherwise we will have to pay more,” said Veco. Councillor Malusi Booi, Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for human settlements, said the anti-land invasion unit has done its very best to prevent people erecting homes on land that is not suitable for human habitation. He said the City could not provide services on privately owned land. “The provision of service to these pieces of land was not planned and therefore was not included in the City’s current budget or resource allocation,” said Booi.
