NDWEDWE residents, north of Durban are planning another shutdown. They are demanding a mall and motor testing station in the village. The protest is being organised by Ndwedwe Development Committee leader Bishop Bheki Ngcobo. He said they have been talking to the Ndwedwe Municipality and Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) about their demands, but it seems no one cares about them. He said the shutdown will start next week and nothing will leave or get into Ndwedwe until Cogta MEC Sipho Hlomuka tells people when their demands will be met. He said residents gave the municipality and Hlomuka enough time to address these problems, but they ignored them. “We expected mayor Nkosinathi Chili and Cogta officials to speak to local inkosi to allocate land for the mall and testing ground, but nothing has happened,” said Bheki. He called on residents to prepare for a month-long or longer shutdown – until government agrees to their demands. Cogta spokesman Senzo Mzila pointed out that malls were built by private companies. He said his department will look into the issue of a motor testing centre so people don’t travel long distances for such services. “I think Ngcobo and his committee should be reminded that government can only support local investments, but doesn’t build malls,” said Mzila. Municipal spokeswoman Thobile Nxumalo said the mayor was organising a meeting with Ngcobo to hear what the problem was.
