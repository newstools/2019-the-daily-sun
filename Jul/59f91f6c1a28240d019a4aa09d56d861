Two boys and their mother were injured when they were flung from a bakkie during a collision on the N1 highway on Sunday afternoon. According to Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst, paramedics responded to reports of a collision between two vehicles on the N1 northbound near the Beyers Naud√© off-ramp in Fairland at 16:41 on Sunday. "All three occupants, an adult female and two male minors from the bakkie, were ejected," Herbst said. A 10-year-old boy sustained serious injuries and required advanced life support intervention to stabilise him. A 12-year-old boy sustained moderate injuries and their mother had sustained minor injuries. "All the patients were treated on scene and once stabilised were transported by ambulance to hospital for further treatment. "The driver of the light motor vehicle was not found on scene when emergency services arrived on scene," Herbst said. SOURCE:NEWS24
