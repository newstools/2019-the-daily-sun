MANY women told Daily Sun they couldn’t wait for warmer weather. They said this was because they were gatvol of sleeping with soldiers. They called their men soldiers as they slept with clothes on, especially Vasco da Gamas, or Long Johns. Nomsa Ngubane (29) said: “It’s boring because when I want a poke, I want it there and then. I don’t like snuggling before it happens.” She said she preferred for her man to sleep naked so what she called her “instruments’ were near. Lungelo Makhathini (38) said Vascos kept men warm. “We don’t tell our women what to wear at night. Why should they?” he said. He said when they got sick, the same women would leave them for healthy men. Lukhanyo Nimrod Pani said: “So every man must sleep with their birthday suit when it’s freezing? I can’t.”
