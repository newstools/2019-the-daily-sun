CHRISTINA Ratlebyana was excited to enter the Woman Farmer of the Year competition. But when she went to her vegetable garden to take photos on Sunday, she was devastated to find it had been destroyed. The 54-year-old from Soshanguve, Tshwane, said she suspected the mlungu on whose land she was farming on. “He said I could plant here and even supplied me with manure. We became friends and he complimented me on how green my vegetables were,” she said. “I even created part-time jobs for residents. I’m a teacher and worked in the garden after school.” However, she claimed, the mlungu’s attitude towards her changed at the end of last month. “He told me he had allowed me to farm on his land but that I failed to make him famous,” she said. The SunTeam contacted mlungu Theo Pieter, who said his workers might have destroyed the garden. “I told her the place was earmarked for housing and the garden should be small and temporary. I even supplied her with seeds and manure,” he said. Theo said he didn’t want to be famous and never asked Christina to make him famous. “I helped her out of goodwill, and I’m still willing to let her farm where she won’t be disturbed by construction workers building houses,” Theo told Daily Sun. “Christina is a friend and I like that she works hard.” he said.
