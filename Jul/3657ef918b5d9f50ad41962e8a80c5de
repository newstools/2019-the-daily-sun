THREE boys aged between eight and nine have died after drowning at Leeuwpoort Dam in Siyanqoba, Emalahleni, on Wednesday. The boys allegedly went to play at the dam in the morning after they were turned away from school by protesting community members. For years, the community has been appealing to the local municipality to secure the dam, since it was unused. Nozipho Ntuli (29) told Daily Sun that the dam belonged to a coal mine which has since been closed. “We have been asking the municipality to close or secure it because it’s unsafe for our kids. They play around there every day. The municipality must do something before we lose more people here,” she said. Emalahleni municipal spokesman Lebogang Mofokeng said: “We are still attending to the matter. The municipality will look at a way of dealing with mines which leave areas of operation unattended after closing down their businesses,” he said. Witbank police spokesman Sergeant David Ratau said an inquest has been opened. “We appeal to parents to keep a close eye on their children to avoid such tragic incidents.”
