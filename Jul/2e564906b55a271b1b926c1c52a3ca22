ILLEGAL dumping is fast becoming a problem in most areas, and it is causing a health problem. This is because some residents are dumping their garbage in open spaces. Some residents of Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, are still dumping their garbage illegally. Municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said few illegal dumpsites had been identified in Seshego zone 4, along Alf Makaleng and Samuel Thema streets. “We urge all stakeholders to be responsible citizens and use designated sites for dumping,” he said. The municipality is now sending a strong message to those dumping illegally as they could land in trouble. Selala said it is becoming common practice for some people to dump waste everywhere. Resident Maite Molapo (32) said some people used nappies and condoms and our kids pick them up and play with them. “This is a serious health hazard,” Maite told Daily Sun. “People know that municipal trucks come to our area to collect garbage every week but don’t use this opportunity.”
