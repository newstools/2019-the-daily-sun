ANGRY parents have vowed to keep their kids at home if trees threatening their safety are not cut down. Parents at Lusikisiki Village Junior Secondary met Eastern Cape Education MEC Fundile Gade at the school on Friday. Gadeâ€™s visit came after a child was recently killed by a gumtree that fell on him and two classmates during break time. Parent Busisiwe Khwethane said she was pleased the MEC had promised to deal with issues they raised, including cutting down trees. They had been complaining since 2010. Nompumezo Nqubula, whose son Alondwe was injured during the incident, said he cried whenever he thought about what happened. Gade promised the process of cutting down trees would start today and pupils would be given counselling. He later visited the family of victim Asenathi Gani (10) and promised to make sure the child got a dignified funeral. Asenathi was due to be buried on Friday.
