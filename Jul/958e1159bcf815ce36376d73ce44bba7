 Three more bodies of Mpumalanga women who are between the
ages of 15 to 24 were exhumed on Sunday.   This after Julius Mndawe confessed to killing and burying
them in shallow graves in his yard. The 25- year - old handed himself over the police a week ago
after he was found in possession of one of the victim's cellphone.   Police instituted an investigation after one of the families
opened a missing persons case early this month. The investigation led to a confession by the suspect who
then led police to where he buried them.  Tokkie Tlaka (24), Banele Khoza (15), Noxolo Mdluli (19),
Felicia Shabangu (17) and Nomthandazo Mdluli (19) were allegedly raped,
suffocated to death then buried in shallow graves.   One of the residents Lizzie Masuku (72) said she didn’t know
that she was living next to a serial killer. "I didn’t know that he would
do something like this, we are so disappointed because he didn’t show signs of
being a killer however, he was violent towards his girlfriends,” said gogo.   “This is very shocking and disturbing. Our children are not
safe, we no longer feel safe," she said.  Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said
they have uncovered five bodies so far. "We came here to exhume the three
remaining bodies. We've got the right suspect currently, if there are any
further investigations that needs to be carried out, we will continue. What we
want to call on is for the public to give us space to carry out our
investigations," he said.   The suspect is expected to appear before the Masoyi Periodic
Court on Wednesday facing charges of rape, murder and concealment of death.
