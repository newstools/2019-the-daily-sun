SANGOMA Nombesane Dezana keeps 25 goats in his yard. They mean everything to him. The 64-year-old from Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun the goats listen to him and obey instructions. Nombesane said he only had one goat in 2002. It gave birth to twins. After that, the goats just kept on multiplying. “I’m a traditional person. That’s why I keep goats. When former president Thabo Mbeki told South Africans to stand up and do their own thing, I came up with my plan to keep goats,” he said. Nombesane said it wasn’t difficult to look after them. He said they were very obedient. “When I open their pen, I instruct them to go out and graze, not to be hit by cars and to come back by 4pm, which they do. “When I was working, I would tell them the spot where we should meet, and they would be there at the appointed time.” The leader of the pack is Gizara, a billy goat with a huge beard. “At one point, I had issues with the SPCA people. They ordered me to take them to the Eastern Cape but I didn’t have the money. The last time they came, they just took photos and left,” he said. SPCA spokeswoman Belinda Abrahams said the organisation had no problem with Nombesane. “As long as the animals are being looked after and are safe, the SPCA will not get involved,” she said.
