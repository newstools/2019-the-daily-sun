CHILDREN who do maths and science at school stand to be successes in life. This is why the NESTLÉ NESPRAY South African Mathematics Challenge was launched – to ensure this becomes a reality. The company met with educators and nutrition experts to discuss ways in which to find solutions aimed at boosting mathematical skills. The maths competition will take place annually and will be organised by the South African Mathematics Foundation. The aim is to empower pupils to become independent, creative and critical thinkers. Kids should be able to interpret and critically analyse everyday situations and problem solving. Adedoja Ekeruche, business executive office for Dairy Nestlé South Africa, said: “We want to support teachers and pupils in making maths attractive and bring it to the forefront as a subject needed to build a brighter future.” The panel included PhD in Mathematics and lecturer Dr Dephney Mathebula, Department of Basic Education chief education specialist Sindiswa Mcosana, vice chairwoman of SAMF, professor Seithuti Moshokoa and Lucia Meko, lecturer at the University of the Free State and registered dietician with the Health Professions Council of SA. Please note that, pupils who make it to round two of the competition, get certificates of achievement. While round three is where pupils will have the opportunity to be crowned the #1 National NESTLÉ NESPRAY Mathematics Champion at the NESTLÉ NESPRAY Smart Camp. Professor Kerstin Jordaan, executive director of SAMF, said the competition will be a success.
