Former Bafana Bafana striker Sibusiso Zuma has criticised
the performance of the players during the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in
Egypt.  Bafana struggled in the group stages where they lost twice
and recorded a narrow victory over Namibia.  However, Stuart Baxter's men did produce their best
performance of the tournament as they beat Egypt in the Round-of-16 courtesy of
Thembinkosi Lorch's late strike.  Nonetheless, they bowed out in the quarter-finals at the
hands of Nigeria - a result which did not sit well with Zuma, who starred for
the national side from 1998 until 2008.  "Performance-wise, I thought it was bad. But then
again, you know with Bafana it's always confusing because they're going to give
you one half of good football," he told KickOff.  "So, you can't say everything was all bad, but when
looking at the games, I still believe they should have beaten Ivory Coast.  "The game against Nigeria, I still believe they should
have won that game, so really it was not a good tournament (overall).   "Our team always shows improvement because we have
those individuals (who step up), but as a team, we didn't do well," said
Zuma.  "In my whole career, I've never blamed the coach,
because I don't remember playing with my coach on the field... 90% of the
things happening on the field is all you."  https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/AFCON/zuma-slams-bafana-players-for-afcon-failings-20190723
