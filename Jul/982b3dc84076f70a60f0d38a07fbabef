American Airlines has apologised after allegedly telling a female passenger to wrap herself in a blanket to hide her outfit. Dr Tisha Rowe said the incident happened on 30 June on a flight to Miami from a family holiday in Jamaica. The 37-year-old said she felt body-shamed and humiliated after being told to cover her “assets”. A tweet she shared of the playsuit she was wearing has been shared thousands of times since. Dr Rowe was flying from Kingston with her eight-year-old son when the incident occurred. She alleged a flight attendant first asked her to step off the plane, then described her outfit as “inappropriate” to fly and asked if she had a jacket to “cover up” with. After attempts to defend her outfit apparently failed and her son become upset, Dr Rowe said she felt forced to wrap a blanket around her waist and return to her seat, feeling humiliated. “To me, there was never an ounce of empathy, an ounce of apology, any attempt to maintain my dignity throughout the situation,” she told Buzzfeed News. Dr Rowe has also accused the airline of racial bias and discriminating against her body type. On Tuesday the airline said they had apologised to Dr Rowe and her son and refunded their travel. “We were concerned about Dr Rowe’s comments, and reached out to her and our team at the Kingston airport to gather more information about what occurred,” a spokeswoman said. – BBC and Essence.com
