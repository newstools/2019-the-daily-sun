THIS man doesn’t believe in sharing his bike with anyone. Vincent Makunyane from Groblersdal in Limpopo, said he waited until he had a bike to learn how to ride. “Nobody lent me their bike when I was learning, so I see no reason whatsoever to lend others my bike.” Q: What model is this? A: It’s a Honda VTR Firestorm. Q: When did you buy it? A: I bought it in 2015. Q: When did you start biking? A: When I bought my bike in 2015. It was a good experience learning how to ride back then. Q: Can you tell us about your first ride? A: It was tricky and exciting at the same time. No one was born a rider, so I took my time to perfect my riding and today I’m a very good rider. Q: Do you have a licence? A: Yes. Q: Why did you choose this bike among others on display? A: I loved this bike the very first time I saw it on display. Q: How often do you ride? A: I ride twice a week and sometimes I go out to have lunch with my wife. Q: Where have you travelled? A: I have been to Swaziland, Kuruman and other places. Travelling is something I enjoy and my bike never disappoints. Q: Have you customised your bike? A: Yes. I’ve ensured that the pipes are louder. Q: How often do you get fines? A: I don’t have tickets. I’m cautious on the road. Q: Do you belong to a club? A: Ye, the Baeti Riders. I joined the club as a solo rider in 2016 and last year they appointed me their road captain, which means that I’m the one who gives instructions on what to do on the road when we ride. Our club motto is Tatso Feela, which means, “We’re having fun”.
