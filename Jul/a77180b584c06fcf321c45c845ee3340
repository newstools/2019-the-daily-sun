SAMSON Sello needs love! The 54-year-old from Caleb Motshabi kasi in Mangaung, Free State, said it’s been 14 years since he had a poke. Now he’s looking for a widow to marry. When Samson turned 40, he thought his life had just started. But he was crushed when his wife Motlalepule (39) died. And he’s been single since. “My wife died of natural causes. I’m happy that I honoured my vows when I said ‘till death do us apart’. “I didn’t want to be involved with someone until now. I’d love to have a woman in my life again. But I don’t want any woman. I want a woman who lost her husband. “That’s a woman who respected the vow of being separated by death. We’ll have something in common, and that will strengthen our love. I’m tired of being alone and teased by my friends. “I don’t have a problem with a woman who has children because I also have a daughter.” Samson said he survives on piece jobs.
