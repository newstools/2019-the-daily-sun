 Free State
police are investigating the murder of a couple in their sixties who were found
dead on a farm near Boshof at the weekend. Sergeant
Wendy Nkabi said the police were still piecing together information, but they
do know that two people, who are not known to farmworkers, were spotted on the
property on Friday before the murder. Netwerk24
identified the couple found dead on Saturday as Sakkie van der Berg, 67, and
his wife Ina, 62. Nkabi said
Van der Berg was giving an employee a lift from the farm Bloubos to Boshof and
as they were leaving the farm, he asked the employee about two apparent
strangers walking on the farm. The
employee did not know who they were either. Van der
Berg returned home alone, and the police surmised the attack started at two
large gates close to the farmhouse. "They
found the two deceased in the kitchen," said Nkabi, adding the alarm was
raised when Van der Berg did not keep to his usual routine. "It
seems like every morning, he goes to pick someone up," she said. The couple
was found tied up inside the farmhouse by a neighbouring farmer, IOL reported. The Freedom
Front Plus (FF Plus) said it had officially asked the Free State's MEC for
police, roads and transport, Sam Mashinini, to discuss the possibility of
establishing a rural safety unit in the province, with Police Minister Bheki
Cele. "If
there had been proactive policing in the district, both these murders could
have been prevented," said FF Plus MPL in the Free State Armand Cloete.
"The MEC and minister cannot keep ignoring farm attacks." Cloete said
the more than 60 farm murders and 217 farm attacks that have taken place in
South Africa since the beginning of 2019 were "proof that farms are being
targeted". SOURCE:
