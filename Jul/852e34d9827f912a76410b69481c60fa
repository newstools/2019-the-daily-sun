Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the protest started on Wednesday near Dithabaneng Mine in Sefalao Village, when residents argued with the security guards. “Shots were fired and a pupil was seriously injured. He was taken to a local hospital, where he later died from his injuries.” He said they received a call from the hospital where the pupil was admitted with gunshot wounds.“We immediately started investigations, which showed the dead pupil was shot during protest action near the mine,” he said. He said it is not clear what led to the incident, but police are investigating. News24 reported that the “1 000 Madoda” have struck fear into divided Ga-Mphahlele residents. They are known by this namefor allegedly accepting R1 000 each to act as the company’s guards, A clash around the mine has been linked to a leadership dispute around the chieftaincy, resulting in violent protests. Dithabeng Mining has been accused by some residents of operating unlawfully in cahoots with the chief, his mother and a traditional leadership faction. Mazzotti has claims of illegal tobacco trading and tax evasion hanging over him. The Ga-Mphahlele Traditional Authority said the legal process was followed in full and everything regarding the deal with Dithabeng Mining was above board. The mining group denied acting unlawfully. Its lawyers, Nicqui Galaktiou Incorporated, said: “It is a black majority-owned and managed company. It holds Mphahlele residents in high regard, focusing on social investment and environmental conservation in the area.” “Its corporate social responsibility is prioritised and plays a critical role in its relationship with residents and employees.” Mphahlele Trust required a strategic, financial and operational partner to prospect and mine. Dithabeng was the only company to propose a 51% to 49% partnership in favour of residents.”
