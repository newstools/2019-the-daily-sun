NIGERIANS living in South Africa did not shy away from showing their absolute support for their home team, as the Super Eagles prepare for an epic Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) quarter-final clash against Bafana Bafana tonight. The match will take place at the Cairo International Stadium on Wednesday night(9pm). SunSport took to the street to get a sense of expectations from both the Bafana and the Super Eagles fans. The Nigerians, mostly in Hillbrow and the Joburg CBD, were bashing the “weaknesses” of South African football, basing their criticism on Bafana’s unfavourable record against the West Africans. Francis, a Nigerian, said the fact that South Africa won twice against Nigeria does not make them a stronger team. “Nigeria will win by two goals to nothing. Bafana are not strong enough,” he said. His fellow countryman Eddie Smith shared the same sentiments, putting his money on Nigeria. Said Smith: “Bafana will find it difficult against Nigeria. They played well against Egypt, but they will fall short against us. I predict a 2-0 win for the Super Eagles.” George Fai, a Cameroonian living in South Africa, threw his weight behind Bafana, saying they would get the better of Nigeria judging by their previous match against Egypt. Said Fai: “The match will be tough but I think Bafana will win because they seem very efficient going forward. Nigeria are sluggish.” Unsurprisingly, Bafana’s stunning win over the hosts seem to have instilled confidence in their supporters, who are looking forward to another brilliant display tonight. Dumoluhle Sgadule from Kwazulu-Natal said he hopes the boys will do the nation proud. Said Sgadule: “Bafana showed against Egypt that we can beat anyone. Nigeria are next.”
