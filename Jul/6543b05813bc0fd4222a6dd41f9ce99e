BUS company workers were furious after new buses were introduced to Tshwane and North West roads over the weekend. Batswana Gare depot chairman Lawrence Nkoko told Daily Sun: “Minister Fikile Mbalula brought in new buses without considering our challenges. We don’t want new buses. We want government to bail out Star Line Buses.” Nkoko said they were not happy and wanted to hand over a memorandum of demands to President Cyril Ramaphosa next month. He said workers were afraid they would lose their jobs. Mbalula met Hammanskraal, Mabopane and Atteridgeville residents a few weeks ago after bus commuters handed over a memorandum of demands to his department. The commuters were frustrated with the quality of service they were receiving from North West Star and the Atteridgeville Bus Service, which were owned by North-West Transport Investments. Commuters said the buses were old, broke down often and didn’t follow road rules. On Saturday, Mbalula introduced 40 new buses to the three Tshwane kasis. They were sourced through the Gauteng Small Bus Operators Council. He said 180 more buses would be introduced to cover the routes North-West Transport Investments was unable to Mbalula said the Gauteng government would soon put out a tender for a new service provider. “This exercise is to prioritise the interests of the people and improve services,” he said.
