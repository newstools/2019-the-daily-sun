GAUTENG Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile yesterday lost his cool. He became frustrated and challenged the Human Rights Commission to take him to court during the commission’s Alexandra inquiry. This came after legal representative Buang Jones asked Maile to take back remarks he had made. He responded: “If you’re trying to intimidate me, it will not work. Don’t treat me like a small boy. The commission is not God but a Chapter 9 institution.” The disagreement started after Maile said he had no reason to doubt the City of Joburg was engaging with the people of Alexandra in good faith. After Jones pointed out there were service delivery issues in the kasi, Maile said the municipality only had so much power and accused Jones of being misinformed. Jones said: “You’re supposed to support the dignity of the Chapter 9 institution and your last statements are not in keeping with that. So would you retract the last statements you made so we can move on.” He accused Maile of going against the Constitution. He said action to be taken against him would be made later. Maile had earlier said he never benefitted from the Alexandra Renewal Project and no one had been able to prove allegations he looted funds.
