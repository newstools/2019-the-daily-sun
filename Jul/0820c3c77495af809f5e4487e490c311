WHEN Oupa Moyane was allegedly assaulted in front of his wife , she thought he’d return the next day. But the 33-year-old apparently died in police custody after being taken in for questioning over allegations he was hiding guns in his house. His family from River-Cross Village, outside Burgersfort in Limpopo, said they couldn’t believe it when they heard rumours on Saturday that he was tortured to death at Praktiseer Police Station. Oupa’s brother Buti (45) said: “I actually started believing the rumours after his wife told me police turned her away when she took him toiletries.” Buti said when he went to the station on Saturday, a cop called him saying he was at the family home and urgently needed to speak to them. “We want to know how my brother died because they searched the house but didn’t find any guns,” he said. Buti said when he went to identify his brother’s body at the government mortuary in Lebowakgomo, he had head injuries and scars on his back. He said they wanted to bury Oupa this weekend, but cops refused to return his ID and wallet. Ipid spokesman Sontaga Seisa confirmed to Daily Sun that a case of death as a result of police action was being investigated.
