 A six-year-old boy was killed on Tuesday afternoon after he
was hit-and-dragged by a bakkie on Magabe Street in Ikageng outside of
Potchefstroom, North West paramedics said. When ER24 personnel arrived on the scene, they found the
bakkie parked on the pavement, while the body of the boy was found underneath
the vehicle, spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "Provincial Fire Services had to lift the vehicle to
assess the child," Meiring said. "Unfortunately, the boy had sustained numerous fatal
injuries. Nothing more could be done for him and he was declared dead. The
driver of the bakkie escaped injury." Police were not immediately available for comment.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/boy-6-killed-after-being-hit-and-dragged-by-bakkie-in-nw-20190702
