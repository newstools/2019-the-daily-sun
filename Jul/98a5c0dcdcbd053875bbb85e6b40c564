Bafana Bafana players will at the very least each walk away
with R520 000 in South African Football Association (SAFA) bonuses after
qualifying for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) quarter-finals. That figure would increase significantly should they
progress further in the tournament OR if SAFA get generous and dish out some of
the $800 000 (R11.35 million) they are to receive for Bafana reaching the last
8. South Africa shocked the football world by outplaying and
beating host nation Egypt 1-0 in their round of 16 clash on Saturday, thanks to
an 85th-minute Thembinkosi Lorchgoal. Stuart Baxter's charges will now meet Nigeria on Wednesday,
July 10 (kick-off at 21:00 SA time) in the quarter-finals in what will be their
third ever AFCON clash. In 2000, Nigeria won 2-0 in the semi-finals in Lagos, while
in 2004 the Super Eagles thrashed Bafana 4-0 in the group stages in Tunisia. Soccer Laduma reported that each Bafana player will receive
R670 000 if they beat Nigeria and qualify for the semi-finals. For winning the tournament each player will receive R920
000.
