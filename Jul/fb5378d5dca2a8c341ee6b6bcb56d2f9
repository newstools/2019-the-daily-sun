THE Big Dawg has spoken!  After three weeks of his mic being switched off, DJ Fresh has publicly spoken out about his controversial suspension on his Fresh Breakfast on Metro FM.  He posted a one minute video on his Twitter this evening thanking people young and old for their concern asking him when he will be back on air.  He saying he also wasn’t sure of what was happening but promised to spill all the beans soon.  “The only reason I’m doing this video is because of where we are right now.  “I need to apologise for the wall of silence. It’s been a few weeks of not knowing what the heck is going on which has been as frustrating for you as it has been for me.”  “Truth be told the reason for the silence is because we had an impasse (disagreement) with the corporation (the SABC). At this stage I can’t tell you whether this impasse is unbreakable.”  He then thanks everyone who has supported him throughout his over two decade long career and says “you deserve better than this silence and I’ll break it…watch this space.”    According to reports, Fresh was suspended after a complaint was lodged with  BCCSA alleging that he used an adaption of the isiZulu swear word "msunery" in response to a listener on air. Also in a separate incident he allegedly told another listener to "stop tweeting from his ar**".  Hundreds of his fans commented on the post promising their loyalty to him.  One Twitter user @MphoDaTriplet said to him: “and please don’t apologize.... msunery is msunery nje qha we miss you” to which Fresh responded: “#ANEVA!!!!!”   The #BringBackDJFresh hashtag has been trending since Fresh went quiet with listeners demanding he return.
