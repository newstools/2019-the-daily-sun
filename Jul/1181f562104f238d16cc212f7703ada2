WIDOW Anna Mavula is losing hope in the justice system. The case against the men accused of murdering North West farmer Reckson Mavula was postponed to 19 September. Standing outside the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane yesterday with her daughter Tshilidzi, Anna said: “We saw the accused passing here. They walk with confidence. We don’t deserve this. “My husband was a hardworking farmer who harmed no one.” Building contractor Schalk Myburgh and his son Schalk Junior appeared before Judge Tshifiwa Mawumela, who was expected to hand down judgment. The matter was postponed as the judge only received transcripts relating to the case on Monday. The two are accused of running Reckson over with their bakkie in Brits in 2015. They pleaded not guilty to murder. They said they confronted Reckson as they suspected he was a stock thief. The father said he fell on him but had no idea how he died. A post mortem revealed he died of blunt force injuries.
