THE Maduna family will replace the missing parts of their
loved one with those of a goat. Sibongiseni Ngcobo (40), the brother-in-law of the victim
Muzikayise Maduna (23), said they needed to give him a burial which would be
accepted by their ancestors. Muzikayise from KwaDabeka, west of Durban, was found dead on
a dump site on 16 June. His head, right hand, 4-5, heart and intestines were
nowhere to be seen. Muzikayise will be buried on Saturday. “His mutilated corpse was kept at the police mortuary as we
were still waiting for DNA test results. Results came back positive on Saturday
and police told us we had to take him out of the state mortuary,” said Ngcobo. He said they were left with no choice but to bury him
because they can’t keep him in a commercial mortuary while they wait for his
body parts to be found. “We’ll put the head and the hand of a goat with him so he’s
accepted by our ancestors.” Previously, Ngcobo told Daily Sun they suspected that
whoever killed Muzikayise wanted to use his body parts for muthi. He said Muzikayise had been living in the bush for several
years and residents would take turns with the family to give him food. President of the South African Traditional Healers
Association Sazi Mhlongo said: “Goat body parts are used to replace missing
body parts when the dead have  been
mutilated. “But his family will have to speak to the ancestors before
the burial and inform them they used goat body parts. “This way, they will accept him and see him as a complete
creature.”
