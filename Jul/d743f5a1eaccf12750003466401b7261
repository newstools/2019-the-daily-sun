SOCIAL development MEC Siphokazi Mani-Lusithi yesterday visited the Xalisile family. The family lost seven members in a tragic fire on Thursday. Different churches were hosting services at the family’s homestead in Ciko Village in Willowvale, Eastern Cape, today. The victims were Nowandisile (56), Abongile (28), Cinga (14), Kungawo (12), Simange (7) and twins Sibonguthando and Simosothando (3). Family member Mpumzi Xalisile (36) said although he lived in Mthatha, he was home when the tragedy happened. “I was asleep at around 3am when I heard my younger brother shouting,” he said. “When I got outside, I saw smoke and flames. I rushed to the door of the house. My mother was pleading for help. “She managed to open the door but she was blocked by the burglar proofing. My mother died while we were trying to help. I can still hear her screaming.” Mpumzi said there was talk of vutha because the fire chased them away as they were trying to help. “I can’t forgive a person who did this to my family,” he said. “When the sun sets, I get scared because I don’t know why this happened.” MEC Mani-Lusithi told Daily Sun she wanted to comfort the family. “No matter what caused this, we are saying they must trust God. We are still applying to the premier’s office for a mass funeral,” she said. “We are also busy negotiating with the human settlements department to check what we can do to rebuild the house that has been destroyed.”
