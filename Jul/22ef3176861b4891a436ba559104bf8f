A COUPLE
from Umlazi south of Durban was burnt to death beyond recognition on Monday. Ntokozo
Mfeka (31) and his baby mama died when their shack caught fire in the early
hours this morning. The couple
lived together at A section next to Zwelethu railway station. Nosinikelo
Malawana (25) whose shack was nearly burnt said she was woken up by loud
screams of a woman's voice who was shouting for help. She said
she saw the flames in her shack and quickly went out to check what was going
on. "I saw
their shack in flames and shouted to other neighbours to wake up. We tried to
put out the fire but it was too late. â€œNtokozo
and Busisiwe Ndlovu were
already dead. We found them holding each other behind the door dead," said
Nosinikelo. She said
she suspected that the couple left the stove on and fell asleep. The woman's
relative Makhosi Hlophe (45) said Busi's death was a double tragedy as they
were preparing to bury her uncle this weekend. She said
she doesn't believe the fire was caused, because Busisiwe wouldn't cook in the middle
of the night. Cops
spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said Umlazi police have opened an inquest
docket and are investigating circumstances surrounding couple's death.
