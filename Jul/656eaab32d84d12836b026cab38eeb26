WHEN they found out in 2016 they were receiving RDPs, residents were overjoyed. But three years later, their houses are still not finished. Residents of Winnie Mandela in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun at least 27 RDPs were left without roofing, plastering and windows. They were forced to live in shacks in the same yards as the RDPs. Residents said seeing the houses every day was painful. Osia Tau (59) said: “I applied for a house in 2000, but because it took too long I managed to build my family a four-roomed house. However, in 2016 officials from the housing department came to tell us construction was starting. “They asked us to move our shacks to make space but we didn’t mind.” Osia said he demolished the shacks in his yard but left his four-roomed house. According to him, construction workers were only on site for a week. “They told me another crew would do plastering, roofing and plumbing but this never happened,” said Osia. Vincent Selowa (53) said he was unemployed and couldn’t afford to finish his RDP. “I’ve thought about demolishing the structure so I can build shacks and rent them out because I need the money. “Each time I go to their offices, I’m told they’ve appointed a new contractor to finish the job. They constantly lie to us.” Sarah Kgobu (50) said she was told a new contractor would start next month. “We really don’t know what to believe anymore,” she said. Daily Sun tried since Saturday to get comment from human settlements spokesman Castro Ngobese, but at the time of going to print he had not responded.
