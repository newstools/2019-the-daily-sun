A WOMAN allegedly crept up to the stairs and dumped her baby girl, hoping no one would see her. But the woman, apparently the mother of the baby, didn’t know she was being captured on video from a restaurant on Wick Street in the Verulam CBD, KZN. Prem Balram of Reaction Unit South Africa said members were called to the restaurant at about 8pm after an employee found the child on a pathway behind the building. “Our members contacted paramedics, who assessed the child and found her to be in good health. CCTV footage shows a woman placing the baby at the edge of a flight of stairs and walking away. She is dressed in a long white jersey or coat and she is carrying a big white handbag,” said Balram. He said they were given the video footage so the woman responsible for abandoning the baby could be tracked down. “Anyone who can assist in locating the family of the baby or the mother is asked to contact Reaction Unit South Africa immediately on 086 1234 333,” said Balram. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a two-month-old baby girl was found abandoned at the restaurant. “She was taken to hospital for a check-up. A case of child abandonment was opened at Verulam Police Station,” said Mbele.
