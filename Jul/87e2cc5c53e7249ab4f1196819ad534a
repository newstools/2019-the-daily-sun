THE pair arrested for Pastor Alph Lukau’s “resurrection hoax” are not off the hook as yet. Last week, charges against the two were provisionally withdrawn at the Joburg Magistrates Court, but their problems are far from over. Yesterday, newly appointed Cultural Religious Linguistic Rights Commission chairman David Mosoma said they will be meeting with the NPA over the matter as it tops the list of what the new commission is going to deal with. “The first issue we are going to deal with is Pastor Lukau’s ‘miracle’. “We have begun to deal with this matter, we met leaders of funeral parlours,” said Mosoma during a media briefing in Braamfontein. “The matter is now with the court and we have been informed that the NPA has withdrawn the matter – temporarily – pending investigations. “We will, hopefully, be meeting with the NPA because they want our assistance in the matter,” Mosoma added. He said they decided to look into the matter differently as they felt it had a national security aspect. “We are going to meet with Home Affairs, Departments of Social Development and Health and SAPS to inquire about certain things,” he said. Commercialisation of religion and regulations also top the commission’s to do list. However, he said it is not religion that needs to be regulated, but the behaviour of individuals misusing religion. Over the past few years, South Africa has seen pastors making congregants do bizarre things. Some were captured feeding people, snakes, grass, rats, while others have been sprayed with doom on their faces. This is the kind of behaviour the commission will continue to monitor.
