AMAZULU will be looking to put their past problems behind them and kick off the new Premier Soccer League season in style. Usuthu, who suffered a number of boardroom problems over the past two seasons, are determined to put their previous problems behind them and make their mark when they open their 2019-20 league campaign against Bidvest Wits on 3 August at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi. Coach Cavin Johnson will be in charge for a third successive season and is hopeful the club won’t be involved in boardroom issues and will be able to focus on matters on the pitch and not those off the field. Said Johnson: “We have had challenges (in the last two seasons) and we have had to overcome them.” In the club’s first season in 2017-18 after they bought Thanda Royal Zulu’s PSL status, they finished in the top eight. However, a few days after the last game of the season they were removed from the top eight. This came after Ajax Cape Town were found guilty of using an ineligible player in Tendai Ndoro who had contravened the Fifa rules after playing for three different clubs in one season. In the matches Ajax used Ndoro, the Urban Warriors were docked points. In turn SuperSport United were the biggest beneficiary as they moved into seventh place, Golden Arrows took eighth position. AmaZulu then finished outside the top eight. Johnson added: “We had the Ajax saga that we were roped into and it was something we had nothing to do with.” Last season, AmaZulu were docked six points by the Fifa disciplinary committee last September. They were found guilty for failing to honour the existing contract they terminated of their former player, Namibian international Phineas Nambandi. “It was a big ask. We mustn’t hide away from that. People said from the start, good night AmaZulu and see you in the National First Division. But we are still in the PSL, but it has been two tough seasons for us.”
