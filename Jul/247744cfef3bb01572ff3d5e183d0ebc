THE uMgungundlovu district education offices in Pietermaritzburg went up in flames in the early hours of yesterday morning. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu condemned the attack by unknown people. “It’s shameful that criminals would choose to target education infrastructure with their unlawful behaviour,” he said. “The infrastructure is supposed to add value to the community and improve the life chances of our youth.” Mshengu said the offices were badly damaged. He said the fire would cause unnecessary delays in curriculum delivery. The school in Weenen, KZN Midlands, was closed after pupils fought on the premises. After meeting with teachers, parents and local traditional leaders, Mshengu decided to reopen the school. He said they asked parents to inform the department if their kids carried any weapons.
