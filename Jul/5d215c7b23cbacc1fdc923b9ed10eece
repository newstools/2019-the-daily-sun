DAVID Mdingi always looks fresh and clean on the streets, but his bedroom is allegedly dirty and smells like urine. According to his sister-in-law Luluma Nzo (65), she was gatvol of the 58-year-old David from Pimville, Soweto, not cleaning up after himself. “If he put as much effort into cleaning his room as he does looking after himself, we wouldn’t have a problem. His room has been like this for more than eight years, and he refuses to clean it,” she said. The fight has left David’s brother Sipho (61) caught in the middle. “I have tried talking to my brother but he refuses to listen. I honestly think he is just being disrespectful and stubborn to spite me,” he said. “I love my brother and I can’t ask him to leave and find another place. All I’m doing is asking him to act like a grown up and clean up after himself.” But David said the room was empty, so he didn’t see the point of cleaning it. “It has nothing. No dressing table or even a wardrobe. It’s not like I’ll ever bring someone over, so I’m not doing it.” David said Luluma often spoke to him as if he was a child. “The day she starts talking to me like an adult and stops involving strangers in our family affairs is the day I’ll clean this room,” he said.
