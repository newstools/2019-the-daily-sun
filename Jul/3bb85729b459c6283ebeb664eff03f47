BLACK people in Mzansi are still badly affected by poverty and unemployment. And it’s getting worse. This is according to Statistician General Resinga Maluke, speaking during the 25 Years of Democracy Conference at the University of Joburg on Tuesday. He said unemployment and poor education levels contribute about 63% towards poverty. “Black Africans, particularly black women are most vulnerable to labour markets, followed by coloured women. “Unemployment does not affect whites , as well as the Indian/Asian population as much.” The SunTeam visited Stjwetla along the Jukskei River in Alexandra north of Joburg to check on their living conditions. Most of people in the area are unemployed or earn very little. Resident Nhlamulo Khoza (30) told the People’s Paper she came to the area looking for a job, but hasn’t had any luck. “I occasionally get odd jobs, but the money is not even enough. I once got an odd job earning R800 fortnightly and had to pay R600 for rent, buy food and send some home for the kids.” Nhlamulo said there hasn’t been any improvement in her life or the area in the six years she’as been there. She has three children aged 3–11, who live in Giyani with her mum. She said they survived on social grant money, which is not enough. Blessing Biyela (37) said he also ended up in the area because he was looking for a job. He worked as a driver for a few years, but has been struggling since losing his job. “I’ve been getting part time jobs. I sometimes sleep on an empty stomach, but I get help from a few neighbours,” he said. Blessing said he’s been applying for a job, but doesn’t know if he got it as his phone is always off due to there being no power. He used to send money home for his 14-year-old daughter but his situation now stops him from doing so.
