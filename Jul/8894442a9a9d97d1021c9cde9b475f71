A FIREFIGHTER has been hospitalised after trying to put out burning train coaches. Five disused wooden train carriages were burnt in a railway dock in Woodstock in Cape Town on Sunday night. This happened two weeks after a train was set ablaze in Blackheath, where two commuters were injured. Early this year in April unused trains at Transnet engineering yard in Maitland were set alight. The initial response team of fire engines found five burning carriages on Sunday, on different railway lines and the officer in charge called for additional resources. The fire was extinguished at around 1.35am. One firefighter sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital. Commuters said they were relieved to learn that the trains were old and weren’t being used. “Every time when there is a train burning incident it means we will suffer delays the following day and we will be put on another train which will complicate our lives even more,” said Axolile Mlungwana (30) from Langa who has been using trains for six years. Like other commuters Mlungwana said he is happy that the last night’s incident didn’t have an effect on today’s train schedule. The old trains that burnt down last night are reportedly not Metrorail’s property. Spokeswoman for Metrorail Riana Scott had not yet responded.
