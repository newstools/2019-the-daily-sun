BRUCE Koloane has denied giving instructions for the Gupta jet to land at Waterkloof Air Force Base. Former chief of state protocol, Koloane told the Zondo Commission in Parktown, Joburg, yesterday that he didn’t have the power to dictate who could land at the base, a national key point. He said there was no way he could have instructed people to issue the clearance because he would not have known the defence plans for the day. Koloane, who is now ambassador to the Netherlands, was suspended for his alleged role in the 2013 scandal. Koloane said he received a call from the Indian High Commissioner, Virendra Gupta, who complained he’d sent a flight clearance request but that there’s been no response from the department of defence. He admitted calling Major Thabo Ntshisi at the base and asking him to process the landing request. Koloane said he asked his personal assistant to make a follow-up, but when she sent the email to Ntshisi she incorrectly said he had telephonically approved the landing. “We don’t have a legal mandate to say who can or can’t land at Waterkloof.” He said to demonstrate there was nothing sinister about his attempt to help, he asked his assistant to copy other senior managers in the protocol division. Koloane said he assisted the Indian Commission under the impression that all the relevant documents were submitted.
