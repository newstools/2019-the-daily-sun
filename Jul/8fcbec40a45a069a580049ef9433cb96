IT seems an inyanga’s bones didn’t tip him off that cops were on their way to bust him last Monday. The inyanga, from Umlazi, south of Durban, is behind bars and is expected to appear in court again today. Sphiwe Bhulose (69) was bust after he was found in possession of illegal firearms and ammunition. The weapons were found in a muthi bucket. Bhulose was bust after cops arrested Sandile Magwaza (48), who was wanted for murder, last Monday. Magwaza apparently led cops to Bhulose’s house, where cops found guns and ammunition. They appeared separately in the Umlazi Magistrates Court. Magwaza made his first appearance on Thursday last week and the case was postponed to Thursday. He faces charges of murder, attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Bhulose has been charged with possession of an illegal firearm and ammunition. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said police and Metro cops helped in an investigation into a wanted murder suspect at Umlazi U section. He said the suspect was spotted walking with three other men, who fled when they noticed cops. “The men shot at cops as they were fleeing. The wanted suspect was wounded in the leg during the shoot-out. “He was arrested and found in possession of an unlicensed pistol and ammunition. The other three escaped.” He said investigations led cops to Bhulose’s house. “During a search, cops discovered a rifle, shotgun and revolver as well as counterfeit cash. Ammunition was found in a bucket filled with muthi,” he said. Zwane said Bhulose refused to co-operate with cops on how he came into possession of the illegal firearms. He said a car on the premises was found to be fitted with false registration plates.
