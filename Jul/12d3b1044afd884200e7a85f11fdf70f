EVERY month, desperate elders queue to borrow money from mashonisas. The loan sharks take their Sassa cards as surety. Then they withdraw their clients’ grants on the first of the month, often taking more than they’re owed. On Monday, two mashonisas were caught by cops withdrawing beneficiaries’ cash in Springs, Ekurhuleni. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the suspects, aged 26 and 30, were caught withdrawing money at various ATMs. “The police spotted them with black plastic bags full of Sassa cards. When they were searched, they were found to have a number of Sassa cards and cash,” he said. “The suspects confessed they were employed by a loan shark in Springs and they were arrested.” Ramphora said R126 000 was recovered from the first suspect and R23 000 from the second. They were charged for violating the National Credit Act. He said they would appear in court soon as cops were still linking them to other cases. “I receive R1 700 a month but the money is not enough. Some of these mashonisas take more than we owe them and we wish something could be done to stop them. “We are stuck with these people because we have so many mouths to feed.” “I don’t borrow much and I make sure as soon as they have their money, I get my card back,” he said.
