COPS are asking for help to identify a human skeleton found in a manhole last week. Captain Johannes Ramphora of the Springs police said they were not sure of the gender of the person, whose hands had been tied and who seemed to have been set alight. “The remains have been taken to a mortuary in Springs. The gender will be decided once the forensic investigation is done. “We appeal to families who have lost a loved one to please come forward,” he said. The remains were found by kids playing in the area, who told adults. Ramphora said Metro police were patrolling around Slovo Park when they were stopped by a resident, who said the kids told him they were playing in open veld and saw a human skull in a manhole. “An officer went there with the people. “She saw the skull and the skeleton and called Springs police. “Sector police then visited the scene.” Ramphora said the search and rescue team and divers were called, because they couldn’t get the body to the surface. “The remains were covered with a cloth around the waist and the hands were tied with ropes. “It seems the body was set on fire. “Paramedics said the victim was killed about three years ago,” Ramphora said. Because of the burn marks and the victim’s hands being tied, a case of murder was opened at Springs Police Station.
