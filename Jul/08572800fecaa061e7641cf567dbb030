A SCHOOL that produces excellent matric results in maths and science every year has been shut down by angry parents. Yesterday morning protesting parents blocked entrance to Dayimani High School in Gottenburg, Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. They were demanding the return of grade 12 maths and science teachers who had apparently been transferred to other schools. They burnt tyres and threw rubbish outside the entrance. School governing body chairman Phinida Sibuyi told Daily Sun parents were angry with the department for unfairly removing the two teachers. “We had a parents’ meeting recently to give them a report on the school’s state of readiness ahead of the final matric exams. “They became angry when they learnt the department had removed two teachers from the school and that a third, a grade 12 accounting teacher, was also facing transfer. “This is stressful and worrying as the school has excelled at maths, science and technology. “For the past eight years the school has produced 100% matric pass results in those subjects,” Sibuyi said. Angry parent Johannes Khoza said the department’s move showed it didn’t care about the future of the kids. “They must come and address us with immediate effect, otherwise there will be no school,” he said. Mpumalanga Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the matter was receiving attention.
