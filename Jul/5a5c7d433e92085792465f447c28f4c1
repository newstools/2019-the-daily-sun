KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune has been ruled out of the Carling Black Label Cup against Orlando Pirates next weekend. Chiefs released an injury update statement on Friday where they confirmed that Khune is yet to be declared fit to play by the club’s medical staff and will also miss this weekend’s friendly against Township Rollers. The 33-year-old goalkeeper has been part in their pre-season training, but physiotherapist Dave Milner has taken caution to rushing the Bafana Bafana star back from his seven-month lay-off. “Khune has resumed training and we’re assessing him daily,” Milner said in the club statement on their website. Khune could, however, be ready to take part in Amakhosi’s Absa Premiership fixtures from August. Milner went on: “He has made a considerable progress, but we will only be able to ascertain his readiness to play at the beginning of August,” “A shoulder injury is sensitive, and we have to make sure he is comfortable and ready to play.” Khune has amassed over 70 000 votes as of earlier this week, but will now have fans re-allocating those votes to another goalkeeper instead. This could now see Bruce Bvuma, who was recently with Bafana at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, step in against Orlando Pirates next Saturday, and Nigeria international Daniel Akpeyi occupy the spot on the bench.
