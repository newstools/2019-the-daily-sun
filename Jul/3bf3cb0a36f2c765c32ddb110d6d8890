  ECONOMIC Freedom Fighters (EFF) MPs were thrown out of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan's budget vote in Parliament. An uproar broke out when EFF MPs disrupted Gordhan saying he is a 'constitutional delinquent'. Following that Parliament security was called to escort the MPs out as they kept on rising on a point of order. When the security was called to escort them out, a scuffle broke out. Following the scuffle in Parliament, the EFF released a statement instructing its lawyers to join the defense of the Public Protector on the urgent interdict lodged by Gordhan on the rogue unit matter. “We are however surprised that Gordhan has lodged an urgent interdict seeking to stop implementation of the Public Protector’s remedial action.” “This is because he did not do the same with the PP before and its remedial actions were still never implemented by President Ramaphosa. In essence, remedial actions relating to Gordhan seem to actually never receive positive response from the head of state,”the statement read.
