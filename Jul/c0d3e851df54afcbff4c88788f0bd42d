VOICE notes doing the rounds on WhatsApp about child kidnapping have caused terror among parents ekasi. Parents in KwaMashu, north of Durban, and in surrounding areas then contacted schools. Other parents apparently even fetched their kids themselves after hearing the fearful voice note on Friday. One voice note, which has been spreading around Durban since last week, claims a white Nissan Almera kidnapped kids from the streets, cut off their body parts, and dumped the bodies. One of the voice notes even claimed a child was dragged into a car and residents couldn’t stop the vehicle from driving away. Another voice note advised parents to fetch their children from school, saying a child was buried recently and another three had been kidnapped. There’s even a picture which residents claim is of suspects that go around kidnapping children. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said he had checked with KwaMashu, Pinetown and other police stations and no such cases were opened. He said residents shouldn’t circulate fake news on social media. “They must verify any information with the police,” Zwane told the People’s Paper. He said children must be on the lookout for strange cars or strange people and walk in groups. “Parents must make sure their homes are secure and become members of an armed response service,” said Zwane. “Be sure that all emergency numbers are displayed in an accessible area.” Mum Sithobile Mkhize (38) said: “My child (7) was terrified of going to school. “I wish people would stop doing such terrifying things.”
