THERE were hugs, kisses and tears of joy at the second Soweto Narcotics Anonymous rally on Saturday. Former addicts spoke about their journey to recovery at the event held at Diepkloof Multi-Purpose Hall. One former addict in his 40s said: “I’m not ashamed to say to you today that I was once a piece of shit before you picked me up from the gutter and turned me into a human being a few years ago.” A woman in her late 20s told the rally she stopped doing drugs for five years after her aunt took her to a church service, but relapsed when she became very unhappy. “I was told I had demons so I decided to stop because I was dead scared. But I can tell you now that in the past year since I have come into contact with you people, I have been the happiest person in the world,” she said. One of the organisers said 186 of the more than 500 people who attended had been clean for three months. “I never knew I had purpose in this world until I became involved in organising such events and for that I’m eternally grateful,” he said. Some of the speakers told the audience about how they stole from their families to support their drug habits. Another organiser said he was satisfied with the success of the rally. He said: “I feel we have a great need for Narcotics Anonymous in our communities, judging by the response from the newcomers and those who didn’t know about the fellowship.
