  A 52-year-old man has
been sentenced to 15 years in jail or a fine of R700 000 for illegal possession
of gold worth more than R1 million. The Hawks in North West followed up on intelligence which led them to a rental cottage of the accused in Thabong. According to Captain
Tlangelani Rikhotso upon searching the room they found gold, ropes, electric
motors and packaged food worth approximately R700 000. “The food is believed to
have been prepared for distribution to illegal miners,” Rikhotso said.  Following the arrest, Richard Khoza appeared at
the Welcome Magistrate’s Court where he was denied bail. He was then remanded
in custody until his sentence. Rikhotso said the gold
and all the items seized have been forfeited to the state. The Provincial Head of
the Hawks Major General Patrick Mbotho warned that activities associated with
illegal mining are burdening the South African economy.
