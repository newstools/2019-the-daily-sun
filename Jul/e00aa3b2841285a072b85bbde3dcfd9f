THEMBI Magubane (45) said being a taxi boss is not easy, but she has learnt to take the blows. The businesswoman from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, owns nine taxis. She’s also a gospel singer with three albums under her belt. Thembi said she loved the taxi industry. The mother of two children said the taxi world is not always easy, but counting profits is always wonderful. “Some taximen find it hard to listen to a woman, even when I come up with a good idea,” she told Daily Sun. Thembi said there’s nothing that makes her more comfortable than walking around the taxi ranks. “The taxi industry needs respect and unity. “It’s a good investment opportunity, even though there are challenges.” Her recording label is called Music is Life. “During the day I run taxis and at night I’m busy writing songs.” She’s working on a live DVD. It will be released in November. “It will be released at the same time as I’m on tour in the UK,” she told the People’s Paper. Her album Singakwazi has been nominated for this year’s Ingoma Awards in the category of Best Female Artist.
