She currently pays R3,000 a month towards his expenses. The student wants his mum to pay for: R3,404 a month for hostel feesR3,000 a month for groceries, food and personal careR500 a month for pocket money, plus R500 for holidays and relaxation.R620 a month for clothes; andR2,200 a month for tuition.The student declined to comment to Rapport. His father said: “All I can say is that I support my son in his case.” The student allegedly told his mother that she had supported his older brother as a student and he expected her to do the same for him.
