THE police anti-stock theft unit arrested two men and recovered livestock worth more than R100 000. Police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci said: “Between Tuesday and Sunday, police recovered 44 sheep, nine cattle, three horses and a goat. “The stock theft unit operation targeted hot spots and areas such as Mount Fletcher, Mthatha, Mqanduli, Ngcobo and Bityi.” She said police on Tuesday recovered two cattle and five sheep at a grazing field in Mthatha. “On Wednesday, six cows were recovered in Mqanduli. They were reported stolen in Dalasile last year.” Soci said the cattle were apparently stolen to pay lobola. “The suspect was identified and police are looking for him. “On the same day four sheep were recovered in Ngcobo and two suspects were arrested. Another five sheep, three horses and a goat were recovered in Ngcobo. “As the operation was concluded, 30 sheep were recovered in Bityi and Mount Fletcher,” she said. “Twenty-five of the 30 were hidden in a dark hole. The sheep were identified by the rightful owner.”
