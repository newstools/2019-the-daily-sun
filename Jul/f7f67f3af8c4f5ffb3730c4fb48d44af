COPS in Calcutta, Mpumalanga are investigating two cases of murder and four of arson after people allegedly burnt down suspects’ homes. This comes after brothers Goodman (24) and Simon Mohlala (31) were allegedly stabbed to death by two suspects aged 24 and 34. This was after an argument broke out at a tavern in Mashonamini Village outside Mkhuhlu, near Bushbuckridge on Saturday. Sergeant Zanele Sibuyi told Daily Sun the siblings died on the scene after being stabbed. Sibuyi said the men were apparently followed by the suspects who had knives and stabbed the brothers to death. She said the suspects were arrested at Mapulaneng and Matikwane hospitals on the same day after they went there for medical help. “The incident resulted in residents acting in anger. “They burnt the houses of the suspects, including those of their relatives,” Sibuyi said. Last month, angry residents also went on the rampage and assaulted two suspects they believed had killed a foreigner whose body was found dumped in a pit toilet. “We want to plead with residents to avoid taking the law into their own hands. Allow the police to do their work,” Sibuyi said. Bushbuckridge Fire and Rescue chief Rexon Silinda said their team attended to an emergency call about houses which were set alight in Mashonamini and Calcutta on Saturday.
