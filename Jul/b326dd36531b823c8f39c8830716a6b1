MPUMALANGA Education MEC Bonakele Majuba has issued a stern warning to people who steal from the department. He said he would tolerate crime and planned to root it out, whether committed by members of the community or government officials. The MEC said people stole food and computers from schools and sold them. He pleaded with the community to guard against such activities and help the cops arrest criminals. Majuba was addressing the community at Thekiso Primary School in Nokaneng, near Siyabuswa, on Monday. He said thugs who broke into schools must go straight to jail. “Crime is rife in our schools, especially in rural areas. Feeding scheme food meant for the children is being stolen and sold by people we know. “Schools are broken into and computers which are meant to teach our kids are stolen. “These thugs deprive our kids of the kind of education that should be preparing them for the fourth industrial revolution. “Computers are the future of our kids as technology is improving every day. “Our kids go hungry at schools because of these greedy people who steal their food. “We also have thugs in our own government who have been identified. I am going to fight tooth and nail to root out corruption,” he said. MEC Majuba said schools were being vandalized during service delivery protests and he cautioned residents from doing so as they destroyed the future of their children. He admitted there was still a backlog in renovating schools in the province but promised that a plan was in place to address the matter.
