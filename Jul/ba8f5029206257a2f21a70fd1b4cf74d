POLICE have warned the youth of Shayandima, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, about the dangers of crime and drug abuse. Thohoyandou station commissioner Brigadier Willie Mashava led a crime awareness campaign in the area . The campaign started at Shayandima restaurant and ended at Worship House Church, where a formal programme was held. Speaking at the event, Mashava said police were worried about the high number of young people involved in crime. “Drug abuse is very serious here, and when young people are high on drugs they commit serious crimes,” Mashava told residents. “We’re here to tell them to stay away from crime and drugs. They must focus on their education. “If they commit crime, they will be arrested and their future will be doomed.” He called on residents not to keep quite when they see crime in the area. Bardwell Mufunwaini, chairman of Munna Ndi Nnyi Men’s Forum, said residents are no longer safe in their homes because they’re being attacked and robbed by criminals. “As residents we should work together with police and root out the scourge of crime,” said Bardwell. “We’re also encouraging the youth to focus on their education instead of crime.”
