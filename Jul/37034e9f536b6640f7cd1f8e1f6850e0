WHEN they left home they were boys, but they returned as men. After a tough two months, 276 initiates were welcomed by Chief Speedy Mashilo at his royal kraal in Suncity, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, yesterday. Mashilo said although they had become men, the initiates would always be kids to their parents. “We’ve taught them not to beat and kill women because real men don’t do that,” he said. He said there were 32 smokers in the group, but 28 had quit. “We don’t want men to use drugs and smoke. It’s not good for their health, and whoever came here with drugs intended to kill the country,” he said. The chief thanked the Ingoma Forum and parents for the support they gave the initiates throughout the process. Forum chairman Musa Thugwana urged young men to attend initiation school. Initiates Sibusiso and Thami Malobola said they were treated well in the bush and were taught how to be good men. Nkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana, chairman of the House of Traditional Leaders, said the province needed more rescue centres. He said 70 initiates were rescued from illegal amabhuma over the weekend. Two iingcibi, aged 20 and 35, will appear in the Tsolo Magistrates Court today and tomorrow for unlawful circumcision.
