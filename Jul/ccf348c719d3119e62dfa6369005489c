SOCIAL grants are meant to go to poor and vulnerable people, but thugs don’t care. They’ve been stealing from Sassa, not caring who’s affected. The agency said 28 000 accounts have been flagged for involvment in fraud. The accounts with different banks and the Post Office are mostly in the Eastern Cape. Spokesman Paseka Letsatsi said they asked for payments to the accounts to be stopped. “Any innocent beneficiaries whose payments have been stopped are advised to make an affidavit at the police station that the details of the bank account holder are correct.” Letsatsi said beneficiaries must then take their barcoded or smart ID and the affidavit to Sassa. “Those using personal banks must bring along proof of banking details from their banks,” said Letsatsi. Letsatsi assured people that all real beneficiaries would receive their grants. “As soon as a beneficiary with a stopped payment has reported it, Sassa will organise a refund after an investigation has been done,” he said. He said Sassa and its banking industry partners will remain on high alert to ensure grants go to the right people. “Beneficiaries are urged to work with officials and police to report crime in connection with social grants so fraudsters can be bust and convicted.”
