CAPE Town mayor Dan Plato and MMC for Human Settlements Malusi Booi handed over houses on Wednesday. Six beneficiaries were able to move into brand new houses in the Mau Mau project in Nyanga. Plato said: “Look after these houses because they are yours. You have become property owners for the first time after waiting patiently for many years.” Councillor Luyanda Nyingwa said the beneficiaries had been waiting for houses for more than 20 years. He said although only six houses were handed over this week, the project would have 434. Gogo Ntombizanele Mjamba (75) said she couldn’t believe she finally had her own house. “I lost hope in getting a house. Even when I was told I was one of the beneficiaries, I didn’t expect much. I thought I would die without owning a house,” she said. Luleka Mdwekesha (72) said getting a house at her age was mostly for her grandchildren. “I won’t live in that house for too long because I’m old, but I’m happy I will leave it to my grandchildren,” she said. The gogo said she was in a car accident earlier this month and her prayer was not to die without getting a house. “God heard my prayers and I’m now here in my new house.”
