  The Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Tertius Simmers
says the national government should not play politics with the province. Simmers said this while briefing the media in Cape
Town today. This comes after national Minister of Human
Settlements Lindiwe Sisulu said her department intends to transfer the land
that belongs to the Western Cape government, to the Housing Development Agency
to build houses for the people. “Instead of seeking to play politics with our
province, Minister Sisulu would do well to encourage ger colleague Minister of
Transport and Public Works Patricia De Lille to release the five tracts of
well-located land in the City which are, Ysterplaat, Culemborg Youngsfield,
Wingfield and Denel for housing development,” said Simmers. He added that in 2014 Sisulu once spoke about building
houses in the above-mentioned places and she should continue with that plan. Last week during her budget vote, Sisulu said there
has been an agreement that had been signed 10 years ago, that would see the
province transferring land to the department. "I am giving notice today that we will
expropriate that land that had been given to us in 2009 and make sure it is
given back to the HDA," said Sisulu on Tuesday last week during her
presentation. Simmers said the agreement was reversed and the
national department didn’t do anything about that. After the Democratic Alliance took over from the ANC,
the then premier Helen Zille reversed the agreement and declared it illegal and
unconstitutional. Sisulu said: "In 2009, the Housing Development
Agency [HDA] signed an agreement of alienation of ownership with the provincial
government of the Western Cape to transfer land that belonged to the HDA, so
that human settlements could be created for the people in the province,"
said Sisulu during the budget vote.
