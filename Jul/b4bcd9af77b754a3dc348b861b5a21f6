FRANCE Olifant vowed not to watch Bafana Bafana games anymore because they kept losing. But after reading Daily Sun’s article about a sangoma’s bones predicting a victory, he decided to watch the national team’s Afcon match against Egypt. Sadly, though, the game ended in tragedy for the 69-year-old from Galeshewe in Kimberley. The sofa he was sitting on caught fire from his paraffin heater on Saturday night, and his shack burnt down. The madala suffered burns on his arms and legs and was taken to Kimberley Hospital. His friend Victor Booi (65) said: “I learnt about the fire when residents ran past my house with buckets of water. “Firefighters put the flames out later but he was already burnt. “He never watched Bafana games but when I saw him earlier, he was excited because of the Daily Sun article and told me he wanted to watch them win. “I asked him to go with me to a local tavern to watch the game but he said he would be happier watching in front of the heater. “I’m just happy he didn’t lose his life. He didn’t see his sofa catch fire until it was out of control,” Captain Bashoabile Kale said an inquest docket was opened.
