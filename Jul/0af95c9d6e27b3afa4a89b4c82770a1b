THE education department has slammed the ongoing protest disrupting schooling at Mpumalanga’s Dr JS Moroka Municipality. It’s been two weeks since schools and municipal offices were closed. People burnt tyres and closed streets over alleged corruption. Department spokesman Jasper Zwane said MEC Bonakele Majuba was begging protesters to allow kids to go to school. He said about 77 schools were disrupted. “Protests should not stop kids from going to school. Pupils should be preparing to write their trial exams in September but are at home,” he said. “ The protest wasn’t supposed to involve them. We plead with people to stop disrupting schooling. “After the trial exams, the kids must come back to start their finals. There’s no money help them cover the lost time. Children need to pass at the end of the year.” But matric pupil Thulisile Mtsweni (17) said they were not allowed to set foot at school. “We were supposed to be doing group studies. Time is running out as we must prepare for our trial exams,” she said. Joseph Mahlangu (18) said he was trying to study at home but it wasn’t the same as being at school.
