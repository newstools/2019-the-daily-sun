PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane feels she’s not getting the necessary support from the governing party. Mkhwebane was given the nod by the ANC to take over from Thuli Madonsela. But now she is being criticised by the party. “I’m being attacked by civil society, opposition parties and now, by ANC leaders who should be protecting me. And there is nothing from the president,” she said. However, she praised President Cyril Ramaphosa for cooperating with her investigation. She said she wished his ministers would do the same. She said she didn’t have any relationship with Ramaphosa, although she had reached out to him. Ramaphosa has agreed to meet her quarterly. Last week, she came under attack from SACP deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila, who accused her of being a hired gun in the fightback campaign in the ANC. She has since demanded he produces proof or withdraws the statement and apologise, or she will take legal action. She told Daily Sun she would also complain to Ramaphosa about ANC chairman Gwede Mantashe, who had accused her of venturing into the political space in her investigation of the president.
