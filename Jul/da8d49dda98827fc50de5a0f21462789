A 39-YEAR-OLD
man will spend his entire life behind bars after he received two life sentences
for human trafficking. Onyekachi
Eze Okechukwu was sentenced to two life sentences plus an additional 39 years in
jail for human trafficking. Okechukwu
was arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime investigating unit in May
2013 at a revolting home in Pretoria, where he ran a brothel and held two
female victims’ captive. The two
females were rescued during an operation and taken to a place of safety where
they received counselling and life skills sessions. According
to police spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha the two victims were subjected to
witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats and
encouragement of their addictions. “Although
the two victims did not wish to remain in the environment they were in, they
were also exposed to the typical mechanisms used by their trafficker who
continued to keep them in a web of trafficking that extended beyond physical
control to psychological control,” Ramovha said. Ramovha
said it was proven beyond doubt that Okechukwu played a significant role in the
trafficking of both victims. “He exploited their positions of vulnerability
and physically and psychologically controlled them,” Ramovha added.
