AFTER a month-and-a-half of fascinating cricket action, the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup is set to conclude today, with England taking on New Zealand in the final. The clash takes place at Lord’s (11am). Hosts England brushed aside outgoing champions Australia by eight wickets in the semi-finals at Edgbaston on Thursday to book their first World Cup final in 27 years. New Zealand, on the other hand, stunned India by 18 runs at Old Trafford in their quarter final on Wednesday. The Black Capsmight have sneaked into the last four on net run-rate, but there was no luck involved in their victory over tournament favourites India to reach the final. The two sides will now battle it out to be crowned champions for the first time ever as neither has managed to win this tournament before in their history. England hammered the Black Caps by 119 runs in a group stage match earlier in the tournament and will be hoping for a repeat of that performance. Jofra Archer has been England’s most effective bowler, taking 19 wickets so far in the tournament. New Zealand will once again pin their hopes on their inspirational captain, Kane Williamson, whose average of 91.33 is higher than any batsman’s in the competition, to lead them to victory. England skipper, Eoin Morgan, was wary of theBlack Capsand the threat they provide heading into the final. “New Zealand have been the hardest side to beat throughout the tournament and were expecting another tough clash,” said Morgan.
