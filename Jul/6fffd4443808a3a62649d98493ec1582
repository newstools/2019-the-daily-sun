THE DA will inspect unfinished RDPs today. Earlier this month, Daily Sun published a story about residents of Winnie Mandela in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, whose RDPs were left without roofs, plastering and windows. They said at least 27 RDPs were unfinished. This week, Gauteng Human Settlements Department said a new contractor was appointed to complete the houses. And this would be done from Monday. Residents said they were not happy to live in shacks in the same yards as RDPs. The houses were built in 2016. Before the construction started, residents were allegedly asked to move their shacks towards the back of their yards to make space for the RDPs. The residents claimed the other RDP construction which started long after theirs were completed andfamilies moved in. Human Settlements spokesman Sithembiso Mkhize said: “The contractor who was appointed for the construction of 50 houses is an emerging contractor and only managed to complete 21 houses. “The contractor was terminated and ordered to vacate the site. “A new contractor has been appointed and the site will be handed over for completion of the outstanding houses.”
