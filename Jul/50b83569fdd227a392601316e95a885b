IT is not often you find Nigeria quaking in their boots or trembling with fear ahead of a meeting with Bafana Bafana. For two decades, the Super Eagles have had Bafana Bafana’s number, dominating them in both official and in friendly matches. But this time the haughty Eagles might want to heed the warning from Austin “Jay Jay” Okocha going into the Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinal clash in Cairo on Wednesday. The Nigerian legend is having sleepless nights about one Thembinkosi Lorch ahead of the showdown, and so should his countrymen. Lorch has shot into Afcon prominence after his wonder goal helped South Africa knock hosts Egypt out of the tournament. “We are aware of his (Lorch) threat. He is a player that I like, I like exciting players,” said Okocha. “Of course you have to respect the opponent’s key players, especially if they are having a good tournament. It’s obvious that in the Bafana Bafana squad the threat was just (Percy) Tau, until Lorch was introduced. “It’s like they are sharing the responsibilities going forward now. These are two players that could cause problems for any team and I’m sure we (Nigeria) are aware of that.” Nigeria have won six and lost only two of the 14 matches against South Africa. But there is a feeling another big upset is on the cards. “For me it’s also about being consistent. You might be a threat today, but if you are not a threat in the next game, then it does not add value to the team because to go all the way you need to be the most consistent, especially during the knockouts,” added Okocha.
