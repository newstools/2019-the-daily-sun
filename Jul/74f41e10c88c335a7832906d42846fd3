FOLLOWING the break at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture, former president Jacob Zuma and his legal team agreed to continue with the inquiry. Zuma took a moment to recognize the part played by the commission's Chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo in order for the two teams to reach consensus. “I appreciate that you were able to meet the two teams and find the way forward. I think it is in the interest of all of us to address issues that face this country in any form,” Zuma said. After that Zondo said it didn’t take long for an agreement to be reached. “You might think we took some time, before we came back but reaching agreement in principle, didn’t take longer than 10 minutes. After we started talking, there is a willingness to try and find solutions,” Justice Zondo said.  The commission adjourned for the day. Justice Zondo said the former president will appear again at the commission at another time that will be arranged. He said on Monday, the commission will continue with matters related to the Estina Dairy.
