FORMER Kaizer Chiefs striker Edmore Chirambadare has signed with National First Division (NFD) side Royal Eagles. This was confirmed by their head coach Joel Masutha, who also revealed that they have also signed five more new players ahead of the new season. The 27-year-old joined Amakhosi in 2016 from Zimbabwean outfit Chicken Inn, but failed to impress in Soweto. Last season, the Zimbabwean international played for NFD side Maccabi under the former Black Leopards coach. “He impressed me last season and I believe he will add more value in our fight for promotion this season,” said Masutha. “His experience of playing for a big team like Chiefs will come in handy for our youngsters. All I was hoping for was for his negotiations with management to go well. I am happy that all went well and I can freely say he is our player.” Others players signed by Masutha include Dumisani Ngwenya, Phetulo Sekome, former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns striker Edward Manqele, and the former Absa Premiership Golden Boot winner Moeketsi Sekola. “All these guys have been training with us for weeks,” explained Masutha. “They impressed us and we believe they can help us achieve our goals. The good thing is that all of them have played in the NFD and know what to expect. You need players who know life in the NFD. Sekola helped Highlands Park get back to the PSL.” “Manqele needs no introduction to football fans. Last season Edward helped Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila reach the promotion/relegation play-offs.   Sekola played for Baroka and was part of the team that promoted them to top flight. So that’s why we signed these guys.” But Masutha said he has not yet done signing as the closure of the transfer window is only next month. “I am impressed with the team we have so far,” he said. “But I’m thinking of signing an experience centre back. We think that is the position which is lacking.”
