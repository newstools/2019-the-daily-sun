THREE people including a six-year-old boy were shot and injured in the Cape Flats over the weekend. The violence continued in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town, despite the army being sent there two weeks ago. Residents told Daily Sun gangsters continued with their activities after laying low for only two days. Thulasizwe Macata from Beacon Valley said: “On the day the army was deployed here, there was a little bit of peace, but it seems they are back to their old ways.” Another resident said they sometimes heard gunshots. “What worries me is that they are not even scared the army is around. If they’re not scared of the army, who will they be afraid of?” he said. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incidents. “On Saturday at around 9.30am, a six-year-old boy was shot and wounded in Lagonda Crescent in Beacon Bay when he was caught in the crossfire between rival gangs. “He was admitted to hospital in a stable condition,” he said. “In Ferarri Crescent in Beacon Valley, two men aged 23 and 40 were shot and wounded. They were admitted to hospital and no one has been arrested.” Mxolisi Stofile said: “When they go around with their choppers, we know no thug will dare rob people because they know they are being watched. “It’s sad that as soon as they leave, thugs will continue with their evil work,” he said.
