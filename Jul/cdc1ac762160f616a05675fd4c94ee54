RESIDENTS of Sweetwaters were overjoyed when a new satellite cop shop was opened in the area on Friday. They said they strongly believe the new police station in the Pietermaritzburg kasi would help bring down the crime rate. Resident Zipho Zondi (56) said: “Over the years, we have encountered serious incidents of crime in our area. “We relied on one cop shop in Plessislaer but they were not able to attend to all crime scenes, which sometimes led to people dying. “We hope having a cop shop here will put an end to this.” He said it was difficult to get to Plessislaer as residents had to travel in two taxis to get there. Cluster commander for uMgungundlovu South, Major-General Phumelele Makhoba, said: “We urge residents to work with us as the police. “It has been seen that when residents work with the police, crime goes down. “For this reason we are asking you to work with us.” She asked the community to help in the fight against drugs and the sale of stolen goods. “When you’re buying an expensive cellphone for R200 from iphara, who has evidently not bathed in months, where do you think he got that cellphone from? Stop promoting crime and drug use,” she said.
