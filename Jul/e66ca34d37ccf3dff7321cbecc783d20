PROPHET Jacob Ndou said more people are pretending to be him after his church appeared in the People’s Paper. “These people are getting me into trouble,” he said. Daily Sun previously reported on the 21-year-old prophet from Rabie Ridge in Tembisa, north of Joburg, who said his three crosses painted on a cloth in the veld can heal. He said he could help people who have problems with tokoloshes, bad luck and ill-health caused by witchcraft. “I stand in the veld next to my cloth and pray for people,” he said. The prophet said people don’t pay him for the prayers. They later come back and thank him with gifts and money for his work. “But now people are copying my church and telling people to pay, which is against what I stand for,” he said. He said they claim to be his workers or even claim to be him when people go to them. “After doing a bad job, the victims came back and complained. The imitators then deny they are prophets and send them to me as if I was the one who misled them,” he said. Ndou said police had come to him six times with people who were scammed and wanted compensation from him. Prophet Ephraim Chanyanga said he never copied Jacob’s church and has his own followers. Another prophet, Prophet Naboth Madiza, told Daily Sun he didn’t copy anyone.
