DELFT residents on Friday took to the streets to protest against killings in the area. The residents, many of them from the Blikkiesdorp section of the Cape Town kasi, blocked Symphony Way. They said they were tired of cops failing to arrest gangs who terrorise them. They burned tyres and said they were happy soldiers had arrived to bring down crime. Phathiswa Makhokwana said: “We’ve been hearing that soldiers were being deployed but had never seen them. “I’m happy they’re in my area today. I believe we’ll sleep peacefully tonight.” She said last week a taxi owner was shot dead and his vehicle and house torched. She said several people were also shot in the street. Susan Williams, a retired army officer, said seeing soldiers in the area made her feel a lot safer. “We’re not safe here. The presence of the army will make the people of Delft feel safer. When I was in the army, I was once deployed to Khayelitsha and the crime went down. People in that area never forgot us. We’re happy the army is in our area today.” President Cyril Ramaphosa last week told parliament that 1 320 soldiers would be deployed to certain parts of Cape Town over the next three months at a cost of R23 million. News24 reported that a 24-year-old man was arrested in connection with the murder of a cop in Delft South yesterday morning and was under police guard.
