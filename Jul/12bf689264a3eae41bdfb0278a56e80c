THANKS to SunPower, Tshepo Tlhabane finally has medical help for his son. The 43-year-old from Hebron, near Soshanguve in Tshwane, approached the SunTeam after his son Lisakhanya was burned by hot water last Monday. Nurses at KT Motubatse Clinic allegedly had turned them away. After their story was published yesterday, he received a call asking him to take the eight-year-old to George Mukhari Hospital for treatment. Tshepo was scared that if Lisakhanya didn’t receive the medical attention he needed, his wounds would become infected. “I received a phone call from the hospital’s acting CEO John Ndimande, and he arranged for me to go there with my son.” “The doctors helped him and transferred me to the clinic, so I won’t struggle to make the next appointment.” Lisakhanya said he was happy he’d be able to return to school soon. “I can’t wait to go and play with my friends again. Thank you, Daily Sun,” he said.
