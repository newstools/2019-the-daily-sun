HEAVY rains and flooding forced many kids around Cape Town to miss school since Monday. Nomsa Nkwane (56) from Khayelitsha said she missed work because she had to take her grandkids home. “I’m sad because I was supposed to drop them off at preschool and go to work,” she said. “But the whole area is flooded and we can’t get anywhere.” Nomsa said when she left her home in the morning, she had no idea the flooding was that bad. “I had to call my bosses and tell them I couldn’t make it because I had to look after my grandkids.” A school bus got stuck in the flooded road while on its way to pick up kids. “You see, the driver tried to go there, but it didn’t work out because there is just too much water,” said Nomsa. Neliswa Maqabaza (34) said pupils of Zola Business School had to go home because they could not leave Khayelitsha. Cape Town Disaster Management spokeswoman Charlotte Powell said there were various reports of flooding in the city. “We are busy with assessments and will provide an update later,” she said.
