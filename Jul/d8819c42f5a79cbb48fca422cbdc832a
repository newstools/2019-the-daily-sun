NYANGA police have adopted Emasithandane Children’s Organisation from their area. They visited the home on Thursday, where they donated food parcels and mattresses. Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi said this wasn’t their first visit. “We want to be involved in our communities. We don’t want people to think of police as only arresting bad guys. We can do a lot of things besides that,” she said. Constable Marelda Abrahams said the donations were made possible by Gift of The Givers. “We are grateful to all those who made this possible because we wouldn’t have been able to help this home without them,” she said She said it was important for them to work closely with their community. “It becomes easy to talk about things happening in the area if there’s a good relationship between residents and police.” Emasithandane manager Wendy Maphoseka (42) was happy with the donation. “We needed it, especially the mattresses,” she said. “We need a lot of help and are happy Nyanga SAPS chose us. “I never knew they also did things like this until they came to our home,” Wendy said.
