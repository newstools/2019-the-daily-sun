BAFANA Bafana have started their 2020 African Nations Championship (Chan) qualifiers on a losing note. The makeshift Bafana side under the guidance of David Notoane, were edged 3-2 by Lesotho in the in the first leg of their opening qualifier played at Setsoto Stadium yesterday. Captain Tercious Malepe and Luvuyo Phewa scored Bafana’s away goals while Tsepo Seturumane, Makara Ntaitsane and Lehlohonolo Fothane netted for the hosts. Notoane’s team comprised of mostly under-23 players as they are using the Chan qualifiers prepare for the Olympic Games qualifier against Zimbabwe in early September. However, with the Chan tournament being played outside of the Fifa calendar, Notoane could not pick his strongest side and was forced to settle for the players who were available. Notoane had initially planned to field his SA U-23 players based in Mzansi, but he had to deal with last minute withdrawals through injuries and clubs refusing to release their players as the new Absa Premiership and National First Division (NFD) gets underway this week. Despite the defeat, it is not all lost for Notoane’s charges as they have the chance to turn things around with their two away goals in the second leg set to be played at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday. The winner of the two-legged fixture will progress to the third and final round against either Mauritius or Zimbabwe, with the first and second legs taking place from 20 September Bafana do not have a good history in the Chan tournament, they were knocked out in the semi-finals in 2011 when it was staged in Sudan. They could not make it out of their group on home soil in 2013 and they missed the last two editions in Rwanda (2016) and Morocco last year.
