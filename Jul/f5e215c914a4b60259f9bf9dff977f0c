THOUSANDS of inmates have been left without warm water or flush toilets. Inmates at Potchefstroom Prison in North West called the SunTeam. They said they are sometimes are given rotting food. “In a cell meant for 40 people, they put more than 100. This overcrowding makes us fight with each other,” said a male inmate. “Some prison warders give inmates knives and they stab each other. We’re not safe in here.” The correctional services department confirmed there was a problem with hot water. Regional spokeswoman Tshidi Mapole said: “Some parts of the centre don’t have warm water due to the growing population. “There is, however, a contractor on site who’s attending to the matter.” Mapole said all food was prepared in the presence of trained officials on a daily basis. “The head of the correctional centre or a delegate eats the food before inmates are fed to ensure it’s of good quality,” she said. She agreed there was an issue with overcrowding.
