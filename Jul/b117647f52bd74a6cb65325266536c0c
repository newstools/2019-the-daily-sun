KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu has called
for calm since a nine-year-old girl died after contracting H1N1, also known as
swine flu, in Pietermaritzburg.  The young girl, a Grade 3 pupil at Deccan Road Primary, died
on Friday.  The school has - on the advice of the provincial health
department, Msunduzi Municipality's environmental health department as well as
specialists and doctors from Northdale Hospital, decided to close its doors
until Monday for a "deep chemical cleansing".  Simelane-Zulu, however, said this does not constitute an
outbreak.  "We wish to reiterate that this does not constitute an
'outbreak' as has been erroneously reported elsewhere."  According to Simelane-Zulu, the virus, which caused a global
influenza pandemic 10 years ago, "is now a seasonal influenza virus that
becomes prevalent in winter and co-circulates with other seasonal viruses …
[it] is thus being treated as normal flu".  The department called on the authorities, schools, doctors
and members of the public to exercise restraint, saying that spreading rumours
about an outbreak would create unnecessary panic and harm.  The department will continue to investigate the matter, but
have advised parents to be on the lookout for signs of severe influenza.  "We have issued a notice to health facilities across
the province to ensure that they are on the lookout for severe types of
influenza, and treat them with urgency. If influenza is treated on time and
treated correctly, it need not have any devastating results," added
Simelane-Zulu.  Those who display worrying signs such as chest pains or
shortness of breath are strongly advised to seek medical attention. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/there-is-no-swine-flu-outbreak-says-kzn-health-mec-after-girl-9-dies-20190724
