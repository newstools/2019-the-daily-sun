THE South African senior netball team has been dealt a big blow ahead of the IFN World Cup in Liverpool, England set for 12-24 July. The Melbourne Vixens player, Ine-Mari Venter, has been withdrawn from the Spar Proteas team due to an injury and replaced by Sigi Burger who plays for the Surrey Storm. Ine-Marie sustained the injury during training while the team was preparing for the Wales Test series and also getting ready for the 2019 Vitality Netball World Cup taking place in Liverpool. Ine-Mari has earned 11 caps for the Proteas and this would have been her maiden World Cup. Burger has already joined the team currently in Cardiff where they will play two tests against Wales. Sigi has 13 caps for the Proteas and this will be her first World Cup as well.
