SHE hates cheaters and has the power to do something about it. Gobela Maria Mangena (59), who’s from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni, wants married couples to be loyal until death. Maria, who’s also known as gogo Mamtolo, told Daily Sun: “My muthi locks the couples together and gets rid of cheating habits and bad spirits. “All attempts at cheating go away. Couples don’t see any beauty other than what they see in each other.” While she heals many other sicknesses, her speciality is locking married couples and stopping them from cheating. “Locking couples is not something I’ve always been passionate about,” she said. “But over the years I’ve seen the heartache when people are unfaithful to their partners.” Maria claimed she helped married couples stay together for as little as R100. She claimed she started helping couples some years ago. She said after she consults, she asks the ancestors how she can deal with the situation and they guide her. She said at first she locked any couple but now she only works with married people. “They have vowed to be true to each other. I just help them keep it that way.” She said sometimes her ancestors tell her that the relationship is beyond repair and there’s nothing she can do about it. Nomagugu (35) and her husband Lungelo Zulu (43) said they were happy to be locked. “We’ve been married for seven years and we’re the happiest we’ve ever been,” said Nomagugu.
