GOOD news for residents. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality this week announced that potholes would soon be a thing of the past. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the roads and transport department has put aside R463 million to improve the city’s roads. “This will not only improve lives by creating better access for emergency vehicles to areas where people live, but will also attract investment,” he said. Head of the department Rosie Daaminds said: “We have surfaced 13,7km of roads, 6,4km of sidewalks and resurfaced 26km of road.” She said her department had started upgrading Daku and Njoli roads, and were constructing Jijana Street. The department also upgraded bus shelters. She said small black businesses were getting 30% of the project. Municipal head of infrastructure and engineering Andile Lungisa said their vision was to turn the metro into a smart city. “We’re building a smart city that will be complete with free Wi-Fi to serve our people,” he said.
