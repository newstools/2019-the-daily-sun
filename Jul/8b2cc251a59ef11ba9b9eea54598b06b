SHE had the calling and went to thwasa. But Lungile Zuma (30) has now vanished and her family are worried. They are left with many questions after she went missing from a gobela’s house in Verena, Mpumalanga, on Friday. Her mum Nompumelelo Zwane (45), who lives in Boksburg in Ekurhuleni, toldDaily Sun she last spoke to her daughter in April. “The gobela rarely allowed me to talk to my daughter over the phone, and I could tell she wasn’t happy,” she said. “I can’t sleep at night knowing my daughter is out there, all alone. “What breaks my heart is that the gobela turned Lungile against me.” But gobela Modzadze Baloyi told the People’s Paper she had an argument with Lungile, and that’s why she ran away. “I always treated her like one of my own. We heard rumours she eloped to Pretoria with a boyfriend,” she said. “She has to come back so I can complete her training.” Daily Sun spoke to sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi, who said Lungile wasn’t in a good state. But Dungamanzi assured the mum her daughter was still alive. “My bones show me the girl left with another male sangoma, who might be her boyfriend,” he said. “Lungile is not in danger, but her state of mind has been affected because her training should have been completed a long time ago.” Verena police spokesman Warrant Officer Marvel Gumede said a missing persons case had been registered. Gumede said the case was handed over to an investigating officer.
