RESIDENTS who protested over the weekend warned their struggle isn’t over and vowed to fight back. Residents of Samora Machel in Cape Town took to the streets at the weekend. They blocked Jakes Gerwel Road with burning tyres. Cape Town law enforcement inspector Wayne Dyason said some protestors threatened to burn a hall and library. Dyason said: “About 12 illegally erected structures were removed by a contractor on Wednesday. “The road was cleared at about 3pm on Saturday. “Threats were made that the library and civic hall would be burned.” Backyarders from ward 33 said their shacks were near the old Mitchells Plain Taxi Rank. “We have nowhere to stay. We’re not going to back down,” said backyarder Chumile Kepeyi (40). “We’ve been renting for five years. “It’s difficult to pay rent because I survive on piece jobs. Now my shack has been destroyed.” The backyarders accused the city of destroying their shacks without notice. They claimed the structures had been there for more than 48 hours and that they’d already moved in their possessions. “These people are heartless,” said another backyarder Mzimasi Mawisa (34), who works as a security guard in Bellville. “There’s no one to protect us. We’re going to fight and protect ourselves and our property. They destroyed my furniture while I was at work. I have no option but to find my own way to fight back.”
