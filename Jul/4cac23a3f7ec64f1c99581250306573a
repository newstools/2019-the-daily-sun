THERE IS hope that justice may soon be served for Botshelo Petja. This comes after Dennis Mashele (36), a security guard accused of shooting the 17-year-old dead during a protest last week at Dithabeng Mine in Ga-Mphahlele, Limpopo, didn’t get bail yesterday. The Lebowakgomo Magistrates Court postponed his application to Thursday for police investigations to continue. The guard was bust on a taxi to Joburg last week after police received a tip-off. Botshelo’s uncle Penebetse (44) said the family is relieved Mashele didn’t get bail as he tried to run away after the incident. “As a family, we know everyone who gets arrested has a right to bail but we had been hoping the court would look at this matter differently and not give him bail,” said Penebetse. He said the suspect posed a serious threat to the public as he allegedly shot randomly into a crowd with live ammunition.
