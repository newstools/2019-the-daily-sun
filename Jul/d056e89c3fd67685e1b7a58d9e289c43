 Many people don't know that VW still makes iCaracara. The VW Caravelle is still in production. The most loved version of the classic Caracara was the 2.6 version and it still is the most coveted of the range. You can buy the classic for anything betweenR50k to R100k. But if you don't want to deal with a 20-year-old VW 2.6 engine which is known for its overheating issues and you want some modern features. VW got you covered.  We played around with the VW configurator to find out how expensive the new age model can get. First the engine. It is not longer situated in the back. The engine is a 2.0 BiTDI with 135 kW and 4000Nm of torque paired with a 7-Speed DSG. And since we are going all-in we also optioned out 4Motion. Two trim levels are available. There's the Pan Americana which starts at R962, 000 but the Highline, the one we went for goes for R995,200 for the 2WD model the 4Motion starts at R1,027,700. The engine is not longer situated in the back, and there's only one option, a 2.0 BiTDI with 135 kW and 4000Nm of torque paired with a 7-Speed DSG. Options aren't plenty, but the two-tone colour, sunroof, a fridge and table inside pushed the price to R1, 020,100. So the question is, Durban or Cape Town road trip?
