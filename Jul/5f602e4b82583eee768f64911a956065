THE ombudsman for the City of Joburg yesterday inspected Alexandra. The team was joined by the Shutdown Movement to inspect areas that concern residents. This included a walk to the cemetery, where tombstones were sinking into sewerage. During the inspection, a number of trucks were seen dumping rubble. Residents chanted and said they were tired of officials inspecting the area without taking action. Xolani Gila of the ombudsman’s office said: “We have a mandate to investigate issues surrounding service delivery, as well as human rights violations. “The inspection will help us identify and address issues that affect people of Alex. “The departments involved will be expected to act.” Housing shortages, illegal dumping and illegal structures were major concerns. “The city needs to enforce by-laws. Collection of refuse also needs to play a role,” he said Bobby Solomons of the Shutdown Movement said they were still waiting for feedback from the inter-ministerial task team appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa in April. “We have realised we can’t always engage in protests because children have to go to school and adults have to work. We are prepared to engage with all relevant departments for a solution,” he said. Last month, Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile said claims that Alexandra Renewal Project funds were looted were incorrect. But the movement said only the findings of a probe would determine whether this was true.
