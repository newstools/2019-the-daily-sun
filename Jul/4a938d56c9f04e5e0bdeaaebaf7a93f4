AFTER Judge
Mandela Makaula recused himself on the Timothy Omotoso trial, a new judge has been
appointed. It was previously
reported that Judge Makaula is linked to a guesthouse that was used to house
state witnesses in the Omotoso case. Following
that Omotoso’s legal team applied for Makaula to be recused from the trial. Omotoso and
his co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho, are accused of 63 charges and
34 alternative charges, which include rape, sexual assault and racketeering. When the
trial was underway, over forty-nine witnesses were called to testify in the
televangelist's trial. At the time
Cheryl Zondi told the court that up to 30 girls were given nicknames and
referred to as "wives" when they stayed in the rape-accused pastor's
Umhlanga Rocks house in Durban. Zondi told
the court that, before she left the house for the last time in 2013, she had
been kept in a room next to Omotoso’s main bedroom.
