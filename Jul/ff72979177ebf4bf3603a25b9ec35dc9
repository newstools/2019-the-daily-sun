TLOU Kadiaka is desperate to find her 19-year-old daughter Kamogelo and her grandchild, Thatisho (4). They went missing four weeks ago. It happened when Kamogelo had gone to fetch Thatisho from Seshego Hospital after the little girl was discharged. Kamogelo had apparently left a message for her mum that she’d visit her boyfriend after fetching her child from hospital. Tlou said the boyfriend is known in the family, even though he’s not the child’s dad. “I know her boyfriend. “I was alerted by him of their disappearance. “He had called looking for Kamogelo,” Tlou told Daily Sun. “That’s when I realised that something was wrong. “My girl has never left me in this manner before. “But I suspect something bad might have happened to her and the child.” Tlou said her daughter is in matric and missing out on her lessons. “She left home on 2 July before the schools reopened. “I’m worried that she’s missing a lot and the trial exams have already started,” she told the People’s Paper. Tlou has pleaded with Kamogelo to come back home. “She must come back home. “All I need is for my daughter to go back to school so she can have a better future.” Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed a missing person’s case has been opened and that cops were investigating.
