Arsenal legend Ian Wright is a huge admirer of former Bafana Bafana and FC Porto striker Benni McCarthy. Wright, who described McCarthy as one of the best finishers of his era, revealed that he even told Arsene Wenger to sign the South African for the Gunners. "I could talk about Benni McCarthy. Benni McCarthy was somebody that when I left Arsenal, I said to Arsene, 'get Benni McCarthy' because he is one of the best finishers I've seen in and around that time," said Wright. The 55-year-old was speaking after watching the Carling Black Label Cup between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. First-half goals from Augustine Mulenga and Thembinkosi Lorch proved the difference as the Buccaneers put their arch-foes to the sword, walking away with a 2-0 victory in a thrilling Soweto derby clash.
