The North
Gauteng High Court is expected to rule on the matter between Public Enterprises
Minister Pravin Gordhan and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. The
Minister has applied for an urgent court interdict to review and set aside
Mkhwebane's findings against him until a judicial review has been completed.
