AUTHORITIES have bust a man for defrauding a Swiss woman of US$240 700 (R3,4 million) through an online romance scam. Moses Igweneme (65) has appeared in the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt in the southern Rivers State. His daughter, Nkiruka Blessing Igweneme, is at large. The father-and-daughter syndicate was bust during a crackdown on internet fraud by Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. It is alleged the Igwenemes defrauded Chantal Meadery following an encounter on a dating app. There was an arrangement of marriage. Moses would permanently move to Switzerland. However, father and daughter feigned several different emergency situations and various other problems that ensnared Meadery into making a total of 16 money transfers since last year. She sought the intervention of the Swiss government, which petitioned the Nigerian authorities to investigate. “Investigations showed that the syndicate has also defrauded other foreigners,” the commission’s spokesman, Tony Orilade, said. Moses has pleaded not guilty to a four-count charge bordering on conspiracy and money laundering. He has been remanded in custody pending his bail application. His daughter has been declared wanted. – CAJ NEWS
