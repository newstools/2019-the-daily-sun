SOCIAL media is awash with stories and videos of consumers at the receiving end of fraudulent activity. The viral clips serve to warn consumers about potential scams, but most importantly, highlight the risks involved in using banking cards for contact less payment, commonly known as “tap and go”. In one of the videos, a fraudster approaches a victim with a point-of-sale (POS) device. With a simple tap, the fraudster manages to withdraw funds from the victim’s contactless card. The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC), however, insists contactless cards enjoy protection measures as safe as the traditional chip and pin payments. In the drive to encourage electronic payments, SABRIC debunks the five contactless “tap” myths. 1. Can fraudsters steal money from my card with a “tap” behind my back? Tap is only effective when the reader and the card in question are pointing in the same direction. This means that a fraudster would need to be very close to the victim. 2. Are tap transactions safe if I do not need to enter pin? Although the technology that allows contactless transactions is safe, your bank uses your PIN number to verify that it is indeed the cardholder making the transaction. 3. How secure are payments made with my phone, smart watch or fitness tracker? To make a tap payment with any device other than your card, for example your phone, smart watch or personal fitness tracker, you need to identify yourself with a fingerprint scan or a private passcode on the device to approve each transaction. 4. Can fraudsters intercept transaction data while I make a tap-in payment? No. During a contactless transaction, no critical information and data, including your name or the CVV code on the back of the card, is shared. In most cases, the contactless card or device does not even leave your hand. 5. What happens if I lose my card? Call your bank and block the card immediately. Your card cannot be used for any significant purchases without your pin.
