Fistic community around the world has been shocked by the death a highly regarded Russian boxer Maxim Dadashev. Dadashev died in the United States following injuries sustained during his fight with Subriel Matias in their IBF title elimination contest in Maryland over the weekend. The 28-year-old underwent emergency brain surgery in Washington after his super-lightweight bout with Puerto Rican Matias on Friday was stopped after the 11th round by his cornerman James "Buddy" McGirt. Dadashev, known as "Mad Max", was unable to walk to the dressing room and was immediately hospitalised. Doctors operated him to relieve pressure from swelling on his brain. McGirt, who said after the fight he "couldn't convince" his fighter to stop but opted to throw in the towel when he saw him "getting hit with more and more clean shots as the fight went on," told ESPN. "It just makes you realize what type of sport we’re in, man.  He did everything right in training, no problems, no nothing. My mind is like really running crazy, right now. Like what could I have done differently? But at the end of the day, everything was fine (in training)." Dadashev took an unbeaten 13-0 record into the 140-pound non-title fight. Dadashev, whose manager Egis Klimas also handles Vasiliy Lomachenko and Sergey Kovalev, turned pro in 2016 and relocated to Southern California to pursue his ring ambitions, eventually signing with Top Rank promotions. Dadashev was rated in the top five by two world sanctioning organizations going into Friday's fight in suburban Washington DC, an elimination bout for the right to become mandatory challenger for Josh Taylor's IBF title.
