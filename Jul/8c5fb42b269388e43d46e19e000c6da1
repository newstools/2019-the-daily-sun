MARC Batchelor was one of the kindest people who ever lived. These were the words of his brother, Warren Batchelor, at Marc’s funeral yesterday at The Crossing Church in Midrand, Gauteng. Batchelor, a former Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs striker, was shot dead in his BMW outside his home in Joburg last week. “He had the biggest heart. He cared about people and loved his family,” Warren said. “I loved my brother. I wish I had seen him more.” Legends who attended the funeral were Doctor Khumalo, Teboho Moloi, Edward Motale, Neil Tovey, Ernest Chirwali and Pollen Ndlanya. Batchelor was a big man and his size was his biggest weapon. He’s one of few players to have played for the three big Soweto clubs. He also had a stint with Mamelodi Sundowns. But his career highlight was at Pirates. He was part of the side that conquered Africa, winning the Caf Champions League in 1995 when they beat Asec Mimosa from Ivory Coast. Former Pirates defender Motale said it was strange that Batchelor was no more. “Today we put the legend to rest, but his spirit will live for a long time. As a player he was aggressive, he was a lethal striker,” said Motale. “He made my job as captain of Pirates a lot easier. It was very sad when I heard the news that he was no more.” Marc had no children. He leaves behind his brother, Warren.
