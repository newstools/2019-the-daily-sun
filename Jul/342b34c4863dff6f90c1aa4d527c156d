WHEN you claim you're "like a Ferrari" in a league full of "Fiats" you'd better back it up. Well, Zlatan Ibrahimovic lived up to the bravado on Friday, proving he's as good as his word scoring all three goals to power the LA Galaxy to a hard-fought 3-2 victory over MLS rivals Los Angeles Football Club. Earlier in the week, the 37-year-old Galaxy striker was asked whether he was still the best player in the MLS, given Los Angeles forward Carlos Vela is the top scorer this season. He replied: "By far, because if he's (Vela) in his prime. How old is he? 29. And he's playing in MLS and he's in his prime. When I was 29 (I was in Europe) Big difference." On Friday night the two strikers featured on opposite sides of the Los Angeles derby and guess what happened. Vela scored twice on the day to take his goal tally to 21 for the season. Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick, a perfect hat-trick which he scored with his right foot, left foot, header. "When you play against a rival like that, in a full stadium, I get pumped. I get adrenaline. This is considered to be the biggest game in the league and I show up in the biggest games," said the Swede after the match. The former Manchester United, Inter, and Ajax, striker now has 41 goals in 44 MLS games and 520 career goals across all leagues.
