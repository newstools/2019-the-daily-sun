IN NOVEMBER, top ANC politicians visited Ipeleng Thaele’s run-down house. The 67-year-old from Phahameng in Mangaung, Free State, said she was happy when she heard President Cyril Ramaphosa telling Mangaung mayor Olly Mlamleli to organise her a new house before the old one collapsed. Last week, the gogo’s six-roomed house fell apart before anything was done. She said she has lost hope in the government. Mlamleli confirmed visiting the gogo’s house with the president. “It wasn’t an RDP but a self-built house. We later found out she and her sister were fighting over the house. We can’t help them when there’s a dispute,” she said. Ipeleng’s sister Emily Ramanamane (62) said there was no fight over the house. “I heard the president was there. That’s my house and no one is fighting with my sister,” Emily said. Ipeleng dismissed the mayor’s claim. “Councillor Motsamai Rasile is spreading lies about us fighting. He doesn’t want it to look like they’ve failed us,” she said. Rasile said: “I said they didn’t agree that the house should be built there.” Neighbour Batsile Pitso said she was present when Ramaphosa told the mayor to fix the house. She said: “Mlamleli said the president’s word would be done.” Ramaphosa’s spokeswoman Khusela Diko said she was not aware of the visit or the house.
