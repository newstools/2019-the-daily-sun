INTENSE rivalry between two factions of an extended royal family turned ugly at the weekend when a 36-year-old man was shot dead – allegedly by a relative. Zenzele Mazibuko was shot and killed at a tavern at Emandabeni, outside Estcourt, KZN, on Saturday. Nomthandazo Dubazane, the 64-year-old mum of the dead man, is fuming and wants justice. She believes her son’s death was triggered by a dispute over the family’s chieftaincy and the suspect’s hatred of her side of the family. The feud allegedly dates back to 2007. She said the current inkosi, Xolani Mazibuko, succeeded the late inkosi Simphiwe Mazibuko, who died that year. “There has been tension in the family following the inkosi’s death as there were different views on who should take over,” Nomthandazo said. “In 2012, inkosi Xolani was installed. My family is in the faction that supports the installed inkosi.” She said she got a call from a man on Saturday who told her to rush to the tavern as a family member had been shot. “I found my son lying in a pool of blood,” she said. Nomthandazo said the man who allegedly fired the gun handed himself over to cops after the incident. KZN cop spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was opened at Amangwe Police Station after a man was shot and killed. “The suspect (36) was arrested on the same day. He will appear in the Estcourt Magistrates Court soon,” said Zwane.
