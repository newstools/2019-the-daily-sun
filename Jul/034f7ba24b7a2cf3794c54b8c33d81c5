MOHAMED Mwela made a brief appearance at the Joburg Magistrate Court after he was granted bail last month. The 20-year-old appeared on charges of murder and two counts of attempted murder after he stabbed three boys allegedly in self-defense, killing the 16-year-old Daniel Bakwela. This was in a brawl outside Forest High School in Turffontein, where the accused and the deceased are pupils. The state asked for a postponement to complete investigation and to get postmortem as well as DNA results. Magistrate Lucas Van Der Schyff to the accused, "I'm going to give it a long remand, hopefully when we get back next time, the investigation would be complete." The case has been postponed to 30 August. Mohamed who was teary last time when the bail judgement was delivered, appeared calm without a single tear drop this thine around.
