Electricity infrastructure theft is affecting the people of Seshogo and
surrounding area outside Polokwane. Municipality spokesperson Tshipa Selala said the municipality is aware
that some households in Zone 1 Extension are out of electricity due to cable
theft. He said the municipality is busy attending to the situation. "Those with information that can lead to the arrest of the perpetrators,
are advised to report to police. Members of the community are urged to be
vigilant over their service infrastructure," Selala said. He also advised that in the meantime, all electrical wiring at the affected
area should be considered to be live to avoid injury and all electrical
appliances should be switched off to avoid damage when electricity is restored. “Electricity supply will be restored once the contractor finishes repairing the
damage,” Selala added. Selala said the municipality apologises for the inconvenience and appreciates
patience and cooperation of all.
