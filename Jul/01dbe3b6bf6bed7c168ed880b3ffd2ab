Dear MizzB, I’M 26 and my wife and I each have a child from previous relationships. When we met, my wife was unemployed and I let her keep my bank card to take care of the kids and household. I got her a job, and now that she’s employed she only provides for her child and not mine. The kids live separately with their grandparents and she still has my bank card. How can I continue to be a responsible father? ) Dad Hey Dad This must be difficult as you seem to feel you must choose between your wife and your child. Respectfully speaking to your partner about it will allow her to see her mistake. Couples counselling will help with better communication and to understand each other’s feelings. It’s important to not let your child feel you have chosen your partner over them. )Send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023, or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za
