 TWO people were injured when a hot air balloon crash-landed
near the M44 in Soshanguve north of Pretoria. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said paramedics
assessed the scene and found two people who had sustained minor injuries. According to Herbst, the hot air balloon crash landed next
to a bus depot. He said once patients were stabilized they were transported
by ambulance to hospital for further treatment. Herbst said local authorities were on the scene and had
cordoned off the area. "Circumstances leading up to the incident will be
investigated by the relevant authorities."
