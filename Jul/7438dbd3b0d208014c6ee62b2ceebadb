EVENT promoter DJ Thonsi is angry with Afro singer Nokwazi Dlamini after she apparently failed to arrive for booked shows. Thonsi, whose real name is Mfundo Nkosi (29), said he received a call from Nokwazi in April begging him for gigs. “She was supposed to perform at five shows around Mpumalanga. I paid her R8 000 deposit,” he said. He showed the SunTeam a bank statement proving he had deposited the money. He said everything was organised. Nokwazi said she didn’t know anything about the matter. “My manager is the one who handles all the bookings.” Her manager, Velaphi Hlatshwayo, told Daily Sun she was booked for the show but they wanted the full amount upfront and only received a deposit. He said this was because the last time Nokwazi booked them, they had to sleep in back rooms. Thonsi denied booking back rooms and said he took artists seriously.
