“IT HAS been over 20 years since I moved to this area and to this day, we still live like pigs!” These were the words of gogo Miriam Molepo (62) from Diepsloot, Joburg. She told Daily Sun every day was a struggle and the councillor residents voted for didn’t care about them. “When this boy started his term eight years ago, he sold us dreams and promised better living conditions. “We even took money from our own pockets to buy him his first car so he could attend meetings,” she said. Miriam said apart from sharing their food with rats, they were forced to eat while constantly smelling kak. “It’s filthy here. “No one comes to pick up the rubbish, so people litter wherever they see an open space. “There’s sewer water flowing right outside our yards and sometimes it flows in,” she said. “There are eight mkhukhus in the yard I stay in with no electricity, water or toilet. There are communal toilets 100 of us have to share. We have to make a fire to cook.” Councillor Abraham Mabuke said he knew people blamed him for everything that went wrong. “Some of the things I’m aware of and some I don’t know anything about. “It’s the responsibility of comunity leaders to tell me if waste has not been collected or a sewer pipe has burst,” he said. He said there was a new housing development and some residents would be moved from their shacks to RDPs.
