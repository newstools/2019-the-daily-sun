TWO ANC men in the Mogalakwena Municipality were allegedly killed because of a report. The report was due to be tabled at a council meeting on municipal irregular expenditure for the previous financial year. Valtyn Kekana (54) and Ralph Kanyane (32) were killed at a braai in Mokopane, Limpopo on Tuesday. Kekana was the chairman of the Municipal Public Accounts Committee while Kanyane was the ANC Ward 10 branch secretary. Thabiso Montana, Provincial executive committee member of Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association said Kekana told him he wanted responsible officials from the municipality to account for fruitless expenditure. “He called and said he wants to meet me. I was shocked when I got another call that he was shot and killed just an hour later,” he said. Mogalakwena municipal manager Beverly Gunqisa said they are saddened by the deaths. “Mogalakwena Municipality staff members must rest assured. Their safety is assured and guaranteed,” said Gunqisa. Limpopo Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba confirmed they are investigating two counts of murder. “I have instructed our police that the assailants must be hunted down and brought to book. Anyone with information that can help find the killers to contact Captain Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or Captain Marcus Mofya on 078 817 8012 or report to the nearest police,” he said.
