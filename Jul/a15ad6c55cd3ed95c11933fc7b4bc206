HE allegedly fired a shot to scare off his attackers, but it cost him a severe beating. The man from Rosettenville, Joburg, was beaten by three angry men on Sunday after he ran into the South Rand Hospital’s casualty section. A video showing the incident emerged on social media. The video shows hospital staff behind a locked gate while the man is lying on a bench. The attackers drag him to the floor and kick him mercilessly. One of the men sees they are being filmed and threatens staff. South Rand Hospital CEO Dr Nobantu Maleka told Daily Sun that hospital management would continuously strive to ensure that a safe environment was provided for all patients and staff. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said no case has been opened yet. “The patient is still in hospital. We’re waiting for him to recover and then he can open a case if he wants to,” he said.
