ON MONDAY, Mzansi had one thing in mind: former president Jacob Zuma’s relationship with the truth. That’s what people made of his testimony at the Zondo Commission. Zuma was back in the hot seat at the commission yesterday. So far, he has spoken about an alleged plot to kill him, claiming it was hatched over 20 years ago when he was ANC chief of intelligence. He also claimed that former public service and administration minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi was an apartheid spy. While his supporters were outside the venue asking, “Wenzeni uZuma?” many who commented on his testimony on social media seemed in no doubt about Zuma’s actions. “He doesn’t remember anything that happened when he was president, but remembers everything when FW De Klerk was president.”
