THERE is an impersonator calling several service providers in a bid to solicit a bribe in exchange for projects. The impersonator is pretending to be Mopani Mayor Pule Shayi. The matter got serious attention last week when the mayor’s office allegedly received many calls inquiring about the bribe demanded by the mayor. People, especially those in business, are warned to be vigilant as Shayi would never do this. Shayi said: “I want to take this opportunity to distance myself and the municipality from such fraudulent activities. People who might have been confronted by these scammers are urged to immediately contact the police as this is a clear case of extortion and fraud.” The impersonator is believed to have called service providers who often provide services to the municipality. Municipal spokesman Witness Tiva confirmed they have referred the matter to the Hawks for investigation. “We mostly got complaints from the service providers who complained several times about fraudsters who called them and demanded money in exchange for projects. In some instances, the fraudsters pretended to be community leaders and solicited money from unsuspecting service providers, saying they were instructed by mayor Shayi,” said Tiva. He urged business people receiving these calls to report it to the police.
