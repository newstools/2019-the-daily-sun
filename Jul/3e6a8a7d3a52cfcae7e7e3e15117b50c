 Kagiso cops have warned motorist
about the ongoing hijackings of delivery vans. They also warned motorists of offering
lifts to ‘hitch hikers’ on main roads. Kagiso SAPS spokesman, captain
Solomon Sibiya said delivery vans are at risk of being hijacked also at company
entrances during delivery. Sibiya said on Wednesday, the 10th
of July, a 67yr old victim was driving a white Kia to deliver at Chamdor's
Fransen street. “Soon after parking at the
company's entrance, two suspects armed with firearms appeared and held him up,”
said Sibiya. “They ordered him back into his
van. Two more suspects also appeared and forced the victim onto the middle
passenger seat,” he added. Sibiya told Daily Sun that all four
suspects sped off in the victim's van and later dropped off him at Kagiso. “A taxi driver who was driving
past, spotted the victim and offered to take him to Kagiso SAPS where he opened
a case of hijacking,” he said.
