The South African Premiere of The Lion King movie took place at The Country Club in Auckland Park, Joburg, on Thursday night. South African TV and movie stars graced the red carpet and talked about their fondest memories of the live action remake of the blockbuster animated movie. Dr John Kani, who voices Rafiki in the movie, said it was an awesome experience working on the production with stars like Donald Glover and Beyonce. "It was for me the most beautiful thing to be part of this project as the voice of Rafiki. To hear Donald Glover voice Simba and to hear Nala, madly in love as a little poppy girl voiced by Beyonce, she did an incredible job. They gave their hearts and made the story so real," Kani said. Lebo M, who worked as producer for the film, said that the most wonderful thing about the experience was going back to the original and putting new energy to it. "The technology and the animation is far off and beyond everything that I've ever seen, he said. Other stars who attended the premiere included DJ Zinhle, Enhle Mbali, AKA and South African Mufasa Cassper Nyovest.
