THE Mzansi rapper Gigi Lamayne has collaborated in a song with the Durban club DJ Happygal. The two talented artists have hinted on their social media accounts that they have the single titled Injabulo. However, the track belongs to Happygal and Gigi Lamayne is featured. It seems like Happygal only wants to focus on the positive, as she continues to use her music to brag about how happy she is. Last year she released a single track Happiness. And the DJ seems spreading her wings as she is featured in the new Mzansi film titled Uncovered that is due on cinemas on 30 August.
