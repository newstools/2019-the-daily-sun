MADALA finally has a new house! The house was handed over to him on Friday. Madala Macaleni Gumede (75) from KwaDlangezwa in Empangeni, KZN, said he was excited. “I had lost hope of ever getting a house. I watched my neighbours get RDP houses left, right and centre, but I didn’t get one. “I ended up telling my heart to be at peace with reality and to just forget it.” He said he was happy he’d now sleep peacefully. “I used to suffer cold shivers at night during winter and wind blew into the house. In summer rain flooded into it.” He said he was thankful to businessman Ishwar Ramlutchman, who changed his situation. “I’m a pensioner. I don’t have enough money. I wasn’t going to afford to build myself a strong house. “All I could do was fix the parts that were in a very bad condition, buy groceries and pay people who helped me with other chores.” He said he lived all by himself as his parents and relatives died a long time ago. He said he never got married and the women he used to date left him and he never had kids. Ramlutchman, who came to madala’s rescue, said he was guided by God when helping poor residents.
