IT was like a scene from a cowboy movie. Bullets flew during a shoot-out between police and a gang of more than 15 gunmen near the crowded Paulianah Taxi Rank in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, yesterday. Bystanders, taximen and vendors ran for cover as shots rang out. In the end, three thugs lay dead along the R40 road. Two other suspects and a cop were injured. The drama unfolded after a foiled cash-in-transit heist outside the Bushbuckridge Post Office. The armed men had earlier held up two security officers and robbed them of an undisclosed amount of cash. The robbers offloaded the money from the security officers’ cash-in-transit van and transferred it onto their vehicle before fleeing. Police spokesman Brigadier Vish Naidoo said police intercepted the robbers, leading to a high-speed car chase and a shoot-out. “An unknown number of suspects fled the scene in a Toyota Hilux and a silver Mercedes-Benz after they had stopped passing cars and hijacked them. The Toyota Hilux was later found abandoned near Hazyview,” said Naidoo.
