ArcelorMittal South Africa may cut more than 2 000 jobs as
part of a general restructuring to cut costs. South Africa’s steel industry is suffering from high costs
for electricity and raw materials, and has been hit by the weak local economy,
the company said in a statement on Wednesday. It expects to report a loss in
the first half and said earnings excluding some items will fall by at least
R650 million. “Due to the difficult
domestic economic environment, the South African steel industry continues to
face significant challenges,” the company said. "More significant measures
have become necessary, including the review of staffing levels." The shares tumbled as much as 17%, the biggest intraday drop
in 14 months. The stock was down 10% as of 10:19 in Johannesburg. The company is majority owned by ArcelorMittal, which ranks
as the world’s biggest steelmaker and has been struggling with weaker demand
and lower steel prices in its key markets. It announced output cuts in Europe last month as the market
came under pressure, with US tariffs deflecting shipments to the EU and higher
iron ore prices boosting SOURCE: FIN24
