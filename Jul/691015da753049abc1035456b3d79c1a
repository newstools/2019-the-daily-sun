STARTED from the bottom, now we’re here! Official Carling Black Label Cup Champion Coach for Kaizer Chiefs, Tsietsi Benny Majoro, has seen his life change drastically in a relatively short period of time. Just three months ago, the 39-year-old from Odendaalsrus near Welkom, Free State was a truck driver. He had recently started that job having spent 14 years as a farm worker. And now, Majoro will be leading his favourite team, Chiefs, in the dugout against rivals Orlando Pirates at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (3pm). “I came from a farm worker to a truck driver and now Champion Coach in a space of three months,” said Majoro. “You can imagine how that has inspired people back home and around the country, they can see that anything is possible. “I have received a lot of calls and messages this week from people congratulating me. My life has changed, this is a dream come true.” Majoro will be up against Pirates champion coach Kagisho Moleme, from Ladybrand, also in Free State. Moleme (37), said the idea of leading his team in the biggest fixture in the country, has not sunk in just yet. “It was unbelievable, I think it will set in when I walk on to the bench on the day.”
