MATILDA Peterson (66) said: “I am just a poor widow who has no one and nowhere to go. Since when is it lawful to evict people who have nowhere to go?” On Thursday, Matilda and 10 families were evicted from an old mine building behind the Home Affairs offices in Nigel, Gauteng. They now are living in the open. Matilda said after being evicted from her home of 35 years, she’s been sleeping on a mattress with only one blanket. She said when she first came to the building, it was a shop for miners and the man running the shop allowed her and her family to live there. She said they cleaned up the place, even though it had no toilet and there was no tap water. As more people came, they divided the space into rooms. The families say they were served with an eviction order. The eviction letter said they failed to vacate the premises by 30 November, 2018, as required by a previous order. But they were not expecting to be evicted as they hired a lawyer to lodge an appeal against the eviction after putting together R600 a month to pay him. Nomvula Makubo said when they got the eviction notice, they approached the municipality for help. “They said they would register our names for houses, but they are only coming now and it’s too late.” The unemployed mum of two children, who survives by baking scones, said she registered for a house. But when she went to check, she was told she wasn’t on the list. Mazwi Kunene, who survives by doing gardening work in Nigel asked: “Where is our government when we suffer like this?” Robert Gumbi from Tsakane, who does gardening jobs for R60 a day, and his wife Lindiwe said they were living in the building for over 10 years. Ward councillor Wollaston Labuschagne said: “It was a legal eviction.” – NEWS24/GROUNDUP
