REALITY
TV star Zodwa Wabantu stars in a local documentary The People Versus The
People. In it, she is her unapologetic and doesn’t hold back on defending the
lifestyle she chose. The Durban-based star tells it like it is in
the documentary during interviews. “Some of you fuck eight different men in two
months while I’m dry in that period and then you call me a bitch,” she said. She
said she always chooses to be herself and doesn’t care what people think of
her. Said Zodwa: “I hear people talking about me, calling me names, but I will
never change no matter what they say. My hairstyle costs R80, but my gigs pay
me R35 000. I’m not trying to be anyone else but myself”. Zodwa said that women who wear make-up and
weaves do so to fit it, but they get home and remove the make-up, their true
colours are revealed.  “Women wear
make-up, heels and weaves, but when they get home and take off the heels, use
wet wipes to remove the make-up, they see a Zodwa,” said the star. The documentary is set for release on the
18-20 July at selected cinemas in Johannesburg, Nelspruit , Durban and Cape
Town.
