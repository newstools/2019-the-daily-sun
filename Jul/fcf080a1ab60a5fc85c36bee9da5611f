ZANDI Hlatswayo has had enough of neighbours pouring out their filth in front of her house. The gatvol woman from Slovoville in Springs, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun people poured pee and sometimes even kak into the drain in front of her house. “The smell is unbearable and I have to unblock it all the time while they fold their arms watching me,” she said. But some neighbours said Zandi had no right to complain as the drain belonged to the municipality and not her. Vuyelwa Luleka said: “This one likes talking. She’s targeting me while many other people also use the drain. “Some even pour chicken intestines into it. It’s a drain. That’s what it’s meant for. Another neighbour said: “We’re giving municipal workers a job, so what’s her problem?” When Zandi tried to explain to residents that the drain was meant for rain water and not rubbish, they insisted she was talking rubbish. Other neighbours said Zandi was right as the drain was constantly blocked. Zama Nkosi said: “When it rains, water can’t pass and ends up on the road. Let’s learn to be responsible.” “We say big up to people like Zandi who speak when something is wrong.” Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said residents should look after municipal property.
