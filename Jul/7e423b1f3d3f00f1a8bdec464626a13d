THE drag racers’ spinning cars stopped traffic, pushed people to the side and drove in the middle of the road. Excited spectators cheered but motorists and residents were not impressed. The car had to spin until it broke down, and only then would traffic be allowed to pass. Organiser Xolani Ntuli of the Daveyton BMW Spinners said their motto is “built it, spin it, break it, and do it again”. The racing took place on the busy Esselen Road in Daveyton on Sunday. Residents said the racing endangered people and their property. Resident Molatelo Mokwena said the illegal drag racing happened near Metro cops’ offices. “We have nothing against the racing but the spinners must find a proper place to do it,” said Molatelo. “The car may lose control and plunge into our houses. “They’re endangering lives including those of spectators. “They may plunge into them because the space is too small.” Mkhulu David Hlongwa (75) said he was too old to be exposed to the noise. “I wish these youngsters could be stopped,” he said. Xolani said they were preparing for an event later this month. He said the racing was done by professional, qualified spinners and since they started they had not had any injuries. “We make sure we don’t harm any people or property,” he said. Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago of Ekurhuleni Metro police said he was not aware of the drag racing. Kgasago said it had not been reported to Metro cops.
