FORMER Kaizer Chiefs and Zambian lethal striker Collins “Ntofontofo” Mbesuma believes his compatriot Lazaruos Kambole could be the much needed solution to Amakhosi’s nightmare. He believes the glory days are back at his former club where he made a name for himself during the 2004-05 season – scoring 27 goals after he’d joined Chiefs from Zambia outfit Roan United. Chiefs, who have been struggling for the past three seasons without winning any trophy, signed the 25-year-old striker from Zambia giants Zesco United on a three-year contract last month. “I know him and I have watched him play. He is a good player and I am confident that he will bring a smile to the Chiefs fans,” said Mbesuma. “I know this is a new environment for him, but he will adapt fast and start scoring goals. He has been doing well at home and I am expecting him to continue with his rich vein of form. All he has to do is to not put himself under pressure. He has to be calm and do what he does best.” The 35-year-old former Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates striker said he wished Kambole could break the record of goals he scored while still playing for Chiefs. Mbesuma has also won the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot twice in the 2004-05, and while playing for the then Mpumalanga Black Aces. “Usually I meet most Zambian players in the country and offer advices. “So I will do the same with Kambole,” he said. Mbesuma also revealed to SunSport that he has signed a two-year contract with National First Division (NFD) side Pretoria University after he left Maccabi. “I am still going to play for many years,” added Mbesuma.
