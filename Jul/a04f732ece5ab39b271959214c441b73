SQUATTERS in Kliprand use bucket toilets because the road to their communal toilets is dangerous. Residents of the kasi near Kleinskool in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun they lived in one of the oldest areas of Nelson Mandela Bay and had no basic services. Bangisizwe Maselana (67) said: “I’ve been living here for 34 years but still use bucket toilets and izinyoka. We don’t use communal toilets at night because of gang shootings.” Wallies Serfontein (56) said although the bucket toilet was dirty, he couldn’t risk his life at night. “We hear gunshots here in Northern Areas every day.” Another resident said: “Our current leaders promised to give us electricity after the approval of the municipal budget. “It’s unhealthy to use the bucket system but we do it to save our lives.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the best way to get rid of the bucket system was to build houses with flushing toilets. “The housing delivery budget is with national and provincial government. “We offer ablutions for individuals or to share and plan to get rid of the bucket system. “We have a shack electrification programme in Wells Estate and will move to other areas as soon as the budget becomes available.”
