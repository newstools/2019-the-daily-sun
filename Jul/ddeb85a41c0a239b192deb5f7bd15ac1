THEY can’t open their windows and can’t go outside because of the stink. Luthando Ndinga (43) from Lower Crossroads, Cape Town, said they have been reporting the blocked drain for the past month, but haven’t seen any action. “People are forced to wear gumboots. This is bad for us and our kids. They’re getting sick because of this smell,” he said. Nomsa Ntengo (36) said children are developing rashes because of the blocked drain. “It’s not only the blocked drain in the area. The city always takes its time to fix problems,” she said. She said they hoped the People’s Paper would help them. Acting MMC for water and waste JP Smith said residents should log service requests and report faults and allow the relevant departments to fix problems. He said sometimes the spillages are caused by blockages some distance away. “This gives an impression that the city doesn’t respond when in fact they’re clearing the blockages further down the network,” said Smith. “Regarding this complaint, the water and sanitation department will investigate.” He said the City offers many ways for residents to log complaints and they must make use of one of the methods convenient to them. Water problems can be reported by sending an SMS to 31373 or at a walk-in centre. Residents can call 0860 103 089 or send WhatsApp messages to 063 407 3699.
