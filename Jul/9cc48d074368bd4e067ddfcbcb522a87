Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi will remain a central figure in the IFP after stepping down from the highest office. Buthelezi looks set to remain the party’s parliamentary leader from August, IOL reported yesterday. IFP general secretary Velenkosini Hlabisa, who is tipped to succeed Buthelezi as president, said whoever is elected leader will work closely with him. Earlier this year, Buthelezi indicated he would be stepping down as leader. He said he should not have been the face of the party’s election campaign but he was compelled to do so by the party’s structures and to ensure his legacy was not destroyed. However, he was persuaded to stay on, the party’s national spokesman, Mkhuleko Hlengwa said, after the announcement of the general election results. At the time Buthelezi said: “I have very publicly and clearly indicated what will happen, when it will happen and how it will happen. “So, there is no surprise whatsoever that I am returning to Cape Town next week to be sworn in as a member of parliament.” The IFP enjoyed renewed support in the general election, again becoming the official opposition ahead of the DA in KZN. Hlengwa was appointed head of the powerful Standing Committee on Public Accounts in parliament. Hlabisa said there would be no conflict between Buthelezi and the new IFP leader. He said when he eventually became the leader of the party as designated by the IFP, Buthelezi would be the leader in Cape Town. “When he is no longer the president there will be no problem,” he was quoted as saying. – NEWS24
