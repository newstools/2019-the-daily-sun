WHEN his house went up in smoke last Friday, Vincent Nkuna lost everything. The unemployed 44-year-old man from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, said he did not know what caused the fire. However, he suspects he might have left his stove on by mistake. Vincent said he was asleep when the fire started. “I heard people screaming. When I woke up, there was fire everywhere. I passed out and the next thing, I woke up in a hospital bed,” he said. Vincent said although he lost everything, he was grateful to be alive. He estimated the damage at R17 000. “Since I don’t work, I don’t know where I’m going to get the money to fix my house. I hope Good Samaritans will come to my rescue.” Vincent’s neighbour, Kgotso Mathibedi (36), said he was asleep at about 11pm when he heard his dog, Sparky, barking loudly. “Sparky doesn’t usually bark at this time. I went outside and was greeted by flames,” Kgotso said. He called for help and other neighbours arrived and put out the fire. “We appeal to SunReaders to donate anything they can to Vincent.”
