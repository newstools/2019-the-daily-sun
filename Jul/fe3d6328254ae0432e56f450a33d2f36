LAST week, it was announced that 1 200 new jobs are coming to Tshwane. At a business breakfast in Mamelodi, Tshwane, Ford said these jobs would be created at its Silverton plant to meet demand for the new Ranger, Raptor and Everest. These new jobs will take the company’s total employment to 5 500 in Mzansi. The plant will run three shifts around the clock, Monday to Thursday. Two-thirds of the company’s local products are exported to 148 countries. Middle East and Africa vice president of operations Ockert Berry said the company’s R3 billion investment in 2017 in South African plants was bearing fruit. “The investment enabled large-scale reworks at the plant to expand capacity from 124 000 vehicles a year to 168 000 units, 58 000 vehicles more than our original capacity when the current Ranger programme started in 2011,” he said. Trade and industry minister Ebrahim Patel welcomed the creation of new jobs. “These are going to have an impact on the lives of thousands of people,” Patel said.
