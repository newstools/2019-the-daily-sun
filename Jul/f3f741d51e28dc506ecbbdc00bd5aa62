Bulls loose forward Marco van Staden was on Monday added to the Springbok training group and will join the rest of the squad immediately at their preparation camp in Pretoria. Van Staden has been drafted in as cover for Siya Kolisi and will remain in camp until there is absolute clarity about whether the Bok skipper will be able to take part in the initial stages of the Rugby Championship. The Springboks will kick off their shortened Rugby Championship campaign on Saturday, July 20, against the Wallabies in Johannesburg, which will be followed a week later by the keenly awaited rematch with New Zealand in Wellington - the scene of last year's epic away win against the All Blacks. The Boks will conclude their official campaign against Argentina two weeks later, on Saturday, August 10, in Salta, while the same two teams are set to meet again a week later in Pretoria in a once-off Test before the Boks report for Rugby World Cup training duty.
