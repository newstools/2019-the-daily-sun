MNQUMA Municipality in the Eastern Cape has the worst roads in the province. But the roads are being fixed. About R35 million was set aside for the project, part of a three-year maintenance plan. There’s also the new N2 freeway that runs through the CBD. Taximan Msindisi Ntoyanto was happy to see potholes being fixed. “We’ve been changing tyres now and again because of these bad roads,” he told Daily Sun. “It seems new municipal manager Silumko Mahlasela is bringing about change in Mnquma. We’re seeing change since he took over.” Mahlasela said the project was meant to knock the road back into shape. “A number of factors contributed to the deterioration of road infrastructure. “These include the end of its design life, traffic intensity, rainfall, oil spillage, crashes and service delivery protests.” Mahlasela was appointed in April last year to turn the fortunes of the municipality around. He thanked residents for their patience during the project.  The municipality has allocated R29 million for other road projects, which will start next month.
