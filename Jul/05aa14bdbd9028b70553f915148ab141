THEY used to do everything with friends, but on Saturday the brothers decided to spend the day together. Their family said it seemed as if they knew they would soon leave this world. On Sunday at about 5.30am, Sibongiseni (31) and Aphiwe Myeki (22) died in a shack fire in Phola Park in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, after returning home from a tavern.  Their devastated mum Nokukhanya (56) said her sons were supposed to start new jobs yesterday. “I was happy things were getting better and they were going to help me, but now they’re gone,” she said. Their cousin Mildred Ntahla said the family suspected the fire was caused by vutha. “Cops and firefighters were here but couldn’t find out what caused the fire. “There was no electricity and they weren’t using candles or paraffin.” Their sister Khuluwa said she didn’t know how her mum would cope.  “Losing two kids at the same time is shattering,” said Khuluwa. When the SunTeam visited the family yesterday, they said they were traumatised. They said by the time firefighters arrived, the brothers were already dead. William Ntladi of emergency services said firefighters responded quickly. “The fire was extinguished. Two burned bodies were found under what remained of the shack. “The cause of the fire is still being investigated.” The family appealed for help to bury the brothers.
