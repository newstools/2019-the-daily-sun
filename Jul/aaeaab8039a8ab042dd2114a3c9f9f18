DESPITE winning many trophies at Mamelodi Sundowns, coach Pitso Mosimane says Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates fans won't accept him as Bafana coach. National team coach Stuart Baxter's future is set to be hot topic when Bafana return tomorrow following their exit in the quarter finals of the on-going African Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt. Bafana lost 2-1 to the Super Eagles of Nigeria on Wednesday at Cairo International Stadium, the same venue they stunned Africa by dumping out the host nation Egypt in the Last-16. The Kagiso-born coach was previously the Bafana coach from 2010 until 2012, having served as assistant to Brazilian duo of coaches - Carlos Alberto Parreira and Joel Santana from 2006. The former African Coach of the Year has been tipped several times by the public to return to Bafana fold after taking Sundowns to the top of Africa by winning the Caf Champions League in 2016. In all his stay in the national team, Bafana lost only twice. But he and the players misread the rules in 2011 when the national team thought they had qualified for the 2012 Afcon after drawing with Sierra Leone at Mbombela Stadium in the last qualifier - only to find that they had not made the cut. Said Mosimane: "I don't think it is possible (I'll be a coach of Bafana again). I have accepted the rivalry (between Sundowns, Pirates and Chiefs) is high, do you know what I'm trying to say. You know Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs fans can't love me." He added: "We have to be realistic. If we say we want a certain style of play, we must have a coach who must help us have that certain style of play of football. "The national team or the football association must head-hunt the coach they want to play the way they want, because if they don't do that we'll get stuck again."
