AFTER a gruelling three months of the Nedbank Ke Yona Team Search try-outs in seven provinces, the team coaches have started the painful process of trimming down the squad. For the first time since the Ke Yona Team was started six years ago, there have been changes in the technical team due to different career growths – this opening opportunities for Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates legends, Doctor Khumalo and Jerry Sikhosana. They have joined Khabo Zondo for this years edition, which was concluded at the Rand Stadium last month. According to Zondo, 48 players have been drafted and are expected to report to the boot-camp at the High-Performance Centre, Pretoria on Sunday. “Time is against us now,” he said. “We well trim down the squad from 48 to 30 players for the second camp, which will be next month. “That will then be followed by cutting five more players which will leave us with 25, which will be under our watchful eye. We are pressed for time.” Zondo said they will be forced to drop 18 players in a space of four days, next week. The 18 players who will make the final team will play against Nedbank Cup champions TS Galaxy later this year. Last year Gauteng did not have any players in the final team, however, this time Zondo was impressed with the talent he saw at Rand Stadium. “To be honest, all the provinces were better this year. But that does not mean they will make the final team. There’s still a long way to go.” The Ke Yona Team Search has played a huge role in unearthing gems such as Aubrey Modiba of SuperSport United and Bongani Sam, who recently joined Orlando Pirates from Bloemfontein Celtic. In the past six editions of Ke Yona Cup, the selected team have never won a match, and they are hoping to make history this year.
