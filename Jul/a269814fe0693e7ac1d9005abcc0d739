Listen to their instructions closely and do as they say., Keep as calm as possible. Everyone reacts differently, but try to breathe deeply until help arrives., Don’t use your cellphone while the robbery is in progress. This could put you and others in serious danger., Immediately try and find a sheltered spot and stay low on the ground., Take note of the attackers to pass information to the authorities: what they were wearing, any distinctive clothes, markings, jewellery and more. Also, try and remember what they look like, their height, weight and other noticeable features., Ensure that your children are kept close to you at all times. Make sure that they are not all over the place while you are doing your mall shopping.
