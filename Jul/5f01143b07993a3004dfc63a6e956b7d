TWO senior ANC members in Limpopo were killed execution style on Tuesday. Councillor Valtyn Kekana (54) and sub-regional chairman Ralph Kanyane (32) from Mogalakwane were shot at close range while sitting in a car outside Mokopane. The murders have brought the number of ANC members killed in the Waterberg district alone since 2016 to six. Valtyn’s brother, Paul, said: “Our hearts are broken. It will take a long time to recover from this tragedy. There is nothing much I can say at this stage except that we are shocked by these murders.” ANC provincial secretary Soviet Lekganyane said it was worrying to see possible political killings flaring up again in the province. “It worries us that we are losing great leaders our party has put hope in,” he said. Provincial chairman and Premier Stanley Mathabatha condemned the killings and asked Mogalakwane residents to stay calm. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the motive for the murders was still unknown. “The suspects fled the scene on foot and we have launched a manhunt,” he said.
