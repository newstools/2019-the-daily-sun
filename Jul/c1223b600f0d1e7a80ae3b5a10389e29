MASOYI police in Mpumalanga have opened an inquest docket following the death of a 20-year-old man. The body of Thabo Shakoane was found hanging on a tree on Monday morning, two weeks after he went missing. Thabo, a first-year teaching student at the University of Venda, left home for a walk two weeks ago and never returned. His family opened a missing person’s case at Masoyi cop shop after Thabo disappeared on 12 July. Masoyi Police Station spokeswoman Captain Naniki Nonyane said cops and the community launched a search for Thabo. On Monday, kids in the area discovered Thabo’s body in the veld. “We’ve now opened an inquest docket and investigations are still continuing,” she said. Thabo’s body was found with bruises and burnt marks. His mum Busi Chauke (41) said it looked like people who killed Thabo were trying to burn him. “His body is bruised and has dark marks. It looks like he was burnt. I’m still wondering what happened to my boy because he was a peaceful person,” she said. “I am still shocked and asking myself a lot of questions. Who did it and why?” She said she had high hopes for her son but now all that was gone.
