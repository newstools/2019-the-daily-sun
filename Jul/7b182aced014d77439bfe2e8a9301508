THE magoshas were tired of losing customers and came up with a plan. They started using tombstones as beds to service their clients! Daily Sun visited the old cemetery in Carletonville, west of Joburg, and found used condoms on top of a tombstone. Vusumuzi Gwebu (36) told the People’s Paper he poked a magosha on a tombstone because it was better than the ground. “The tombstone is smooth. You will swear you were on a bed,” he said. He said at first, he refused when a magosha told him they should do it on top of a tombstone. “But then the ground hurt us. The next time, we tried the tombstone and it was smooth,” he said. Daily Sun spoke to magoshas seated not far from the cemetery. They refused to be photographed. One sex worker who gave her name as Mbali told the SunTeam she had been doing the work for more than three years. “This is where we find clients. It is our hot spot. We used to struggle with a place to poke until we realised that tombstones could be the place for us.” She said they used to lose a lot of clients when they poked on the ground. “Many refused to go on the ground and didn’t want to waste money booking rooms. It was a loss for us.” Another magosha said they tried to clean the mess after poking on the tombstones. “We also make sure no one sees us when we are with clients. Others make sure the coast is clear while we’re busy,” she said. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya told Daily Sun they were inviting bad luck. “The dead should be respected. What those people are doing is very wrong. They might not be punished today but they will be one day,” he said.
