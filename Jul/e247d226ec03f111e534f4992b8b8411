SANCO and the Bushbuckridge Business Chamber have both accused Bushbuckridge Municipality of flouting due processes when it terminated a contract with Rand Water. The two parties have applied for a court interdict to force the municipality to reverse its decision and consult residents first, so everyone can make an input. The municipality cancelled the water supply contract with Rand Water last month and elected to take over the responsibility. It said the move would save it R12 million a month. But Bushbuckridge Sanco member Velly Mokgotho was not impressed. He told Daily Sun on Tuesday his organisation was not consulted. “They just made an announcement. This is the main reason we want them to wait. We want to engage on the assessment report first and to listen to the views of unions as workers still have unanswered questions. “This assessment report the municipality is hiding makes us suspicious.” Bushbuckridge Business Chamber’s Mike Ngobeni said he doubted if the municipality had the capacity to supply water to residents. “We want to be sure first that they will be able to supply us with clean water.” The municipality’s Aubrey Mnisi said the municipality would oppose the legal action.
