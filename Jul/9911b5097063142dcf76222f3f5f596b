ANGRY motorists and shoppers bust a thug and moered him before handing him over to cops. The thug and his accomplice allegedly broke into a car outside a gambling place on Commercial Road in Dasi,Nelson Mandela Bay, on Wednesday. The driver of the white Ford Ranger bakkie said: “We work for V Slots and were busy inside. “But we heard a noise from outside as shoppers and motorists shouted, urging everyone to give chase. The two suspects ran away with a laptop in a bag. “But we managed to corner one of the suspects with the help of other motorists and recovered the laptop. The other one ran away.” Some of the motorists and shoppers called for the thug’s death. They said breaking into cars and robbing people was the order of the day on this busy road. An angry motorist said: “We would have killed this man if we were in the kasi. He is part of the gang that breaks into our cars and hides in those railway flats. His accomplice ran into that place. They do this in order to get money for tik.” The motorists called the cops and handed the bleeding thug to them. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said a case of theft was opened. “The suspect was taken to hospital. As soon he is discharged and statements are taken, he will be arrested.”
