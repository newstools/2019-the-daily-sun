  President Cyril Ramaphosa told children
reporters at RX Radio at Red Cross Children Hospital to use their radio station
to change the lives of other kids. He said this after he visited
the sick kids at the hospital as part of his Mandela Day celebrations.  “There are many people you can tell your
story to, so tell the world the story of your life which is what RX Radio is
all about,” said the President. He added that Mandela was
imprisoned but never give up as he continued to have hope of liberating his
people. “Many people don’t know your
condition and the stories of your life; they also need to be encouraged by you
because you can be like Nelson Mandela. Give the message of hope, a message of
looking up to the future. Nelson Mandela did that when he was in jail, for 27
years he never lost hope. “He never felt defeated, he was
always hopeful and through that he was able to encourage other South Africans
to look forward to the brighter future. You can do the same as well,” said
Ramaphosa. The president also told the kids that the government is committed to
protecting children and people living with disabilities. RX Radio is the first ever
hospital radio station for children which is also led by children.
