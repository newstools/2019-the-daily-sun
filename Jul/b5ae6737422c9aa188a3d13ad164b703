TRUMPETER, lecturer and composer Mandisi Dyantyi puts a twist on everything he does, musically speaking. He’s been featured as a session musician by various popular artists over the years. He’s decided to give music fans a taste of his own original music through his debut album Somandla, which has received a Sama nomination. He’ll showcase his music talent alongside his band at the National Arts Festival’s Standard Bank Jazz Festival in Makhanda, Eastern Cape, tomorrow. “I know a lot of people know me as a session trumpeter, conductor, singer and composer. “But in essence it’s all me. In Somandla I made a decision to showcase all my gifts. “I’ve worked hard to master them over the years, so the album is a celebration of that.” He said the album also gives music lovers a chance to enjoy his love of choral music. ) For more information, go to www.nationalartsfestival.co.za
