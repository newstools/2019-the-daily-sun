TWO suspects were bust before they had even finished hijacking a truck. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said they received a tipoff about the attempted hijacking of a truck full of cigarettes at about 8am on Tuesday. “The swift reaction of various police units led to two men being arrested for the attempted hijacking,” Mbambo told Daily Sun. “Our members received information that a vehicle was being hijacked and there was a firearm involved.” He said when the cops arrived at the scene they found a bakkie with a trailer ready to load the cargo from the truck into the bakkie. “The driver of the bakkie was arrested at the scene. Another car with one of the suspects in it was stopped at the Brandfort tollgate by police officers coming from Bloemfontein.. “The suspects didn’t manage to get any of the cargo and nobody was injured during the incident. The suspects will appear in court soon,” she said. Police provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe, praised the members who caught the suspects. “The suspects were arrested before they could even get their hands on the cargo. These are men and women that make us proud,” said Sempe.
