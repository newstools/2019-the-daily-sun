A man who
pretended to be a traditional healer is wanted by the police for allegedly
swindling an Ebony Park man out of more than R500 000 of his pension payout.  The
56-year-old man, who has not been identified by the police, was allegedly duped
in June by the fake healer who asked him to cash in his entire pension after he
took early retirement.  The fake
healer told his victim his money would multiply if he performed certain
rituals.  "Last
month, the so-called traditional healer instructed the former municipal
employee to cash in his money. The money was then withdrawn in tranches and
placed in the victim's house inside a steel box that was brought by the
traditional healer," said police spokesperson Captain Bernard Matimulane.  After the
money was placed inside the box, the traditional healer instructed the man and
his wife to go outside to perform rituals.  "When
they returned to the house after performing the rituals, the victim and his
wife found water on top of the steel box. They were then instructed by the fake
healer to perform more rituals."  Matimulane
said the victim only became aware a month later that the fake healer had
swindled him.  "When
they opened the box they found papers, not money. The exact manner as to how
the money eventually was taken is not yet clear, but it could be that the
healer took the money while the couple were out performing the rituals,"
said Matimulane.  He added
the police were investigating a case of fraud against the suspect.  The
police have appealed to victims of the fake traditional healer to come forward
and assist investigators to arrest him.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/fake-healer-sought-by-police-for-fleecing-retirees-pension-payout-20190731
