A MAN bust last June for poaching rhino in the Kruger Park will spend 18 years in jail, while his accomplices will each serve 13 years. Xifaniso Zwane (30), Nito Khoza (34) and Shadi Mabote (36) appeared yesterday in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga. The court heard the three were hired by unknown kingpins from Mozambique, their home country. Rangers followed tracks and found them with a horn, hunting rifles and an axe before they could leave the park. The three told the court they regretted their actions and begged for lesser sentences. Prosecutor Ansie Venter said the state had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt after evidence, including the dead rhino’s blood, was found on the accused’s clothes. “Rangers risked their lives to battle these poachers, and we ask for direct imprisonment,” said Venter. Magistrate Betty Lesufi said their plea didn’t mean they were sorry but only wanted the court to show mercy. She sentenced Zwane, who was previously convicted for possession of an unlicensed firearm, to 18 years in jail. Khoza and Mabote will each spend 13 years in jail.
