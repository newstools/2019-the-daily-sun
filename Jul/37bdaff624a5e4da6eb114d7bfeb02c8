A SHOOTOUT with the police has left one suspect under police guard in hospital. Cop spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the incident happened in Soweto on Tuesday night. “Members of the flying squad swiftly reacted to information of a car hijacked in Betrams being driven on the Soweto highway. “The members then spotted a silver BMW that matched the description of the hijacked vehicle in Diepkloof,” said Makhubele. He added that as the police approached the vehicle, the suspects opened fire and a shoot-out followed during which one suspect was shot and the other suspect arrested. “The injured suspect is under police guard in the hospital,” said Makhubele. The suspects are facing charges of possession of suspected stolen property and possession of unlicensed firearm. Meanwhile a man has been found guilty of a mob justice related murder. “On Monday the Springs Regional Court found Thulani Mthiyane guilty of intention to commit murder. “He will spend 15 years behind bars, and three more years for assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm,” said Makhubele.
