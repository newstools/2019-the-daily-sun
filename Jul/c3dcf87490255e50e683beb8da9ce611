To make it even worse, the jersey was selling for R75. Everyone loves a bargain, but what the shopper saw was just too good to be true. A surprised shopper, who lives in Cape Town, recently shared a photo of the round-collared, two-tone, brown, check design jersey, emblazoned with the words 'Louis Vuitton Paris'. The barcoded price tag didn't mention the French fashion brand and was instead described rather generically as "PNP Jerseys One Size Multi Colour". A cursory glance at overseas Louis Vuitton online stores shows that a similar knitted item would fetch a substantially higher price, running into the thousands. With fake luxury brands an ever-present problem in South Africa, the major retailer was asked what was going on.  Pick n Pay spokesperson Janine Caradonna thanked News24 for bringing the issue to the chain's attention and said, "this is certainly not an item within our range".      SOURCE: News24
