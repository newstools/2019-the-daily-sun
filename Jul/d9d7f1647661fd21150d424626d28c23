STOCK
THEFT is rife in the Eastern Cape. Thugs
in Mount Fletcher found a very different way to hide 25 sheep allegedly stolen
from a local farmer. The
in-demand animals were found hidden in a dark hole! EWN
reports that  cops in the Avondale
policing precinct  found the sheep that
were reported stolen in the early hours of Saturday morning. Cops  located them during an operation dubbed
“Restore” as units were patrolling the area as part of crime prevention. They
were then informed of a number of sheep that were hidden underground near a
local farm. EWN  further reports that the sheep were later
identified as belonging to a local farmer who had reported them stolen after
waking up in the morning and noticing that the sheep were no longer in the
yard. Police
are investigating and are in search of the suspects responsible for the stock
theft.
