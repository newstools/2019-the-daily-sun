THE woman accused of stealing a new-born baby from Chris Hani
Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto appeared in court today. TimesLive reports that Kereleng Ramoisa (24) appeared in the
Protea Magistrate's Court on where her case was postponed to August 28 for
further investigations. According to the site, Ramoisa was granted R 10,000 bail last
month.  The baby was stolen early last month from the hospital’s maternity
ward.  The SunTeam had reported that the Gauteng Department of Health
opened a case at the Diepkloof police station after CCTV footage showed a
woman, in her 30s, roaming around the antenatal clinic, and then exiting the
maternity area carrying a baby in a purplish blanket.  Kereleng’s bail conditions state that she must stay away from the
witnesses in the matter, that she reports to a police station on Mondays and
Fridays. Cops bust her following a tip off to a house in Diepkloof where
she was found in possession of the baby. The mother of the stolen baby, Bikokuhle Hlatswayo, earlier told
the TimesLive that she wanted justice to be served after her baby was allegedly
sold for R2,500.
