Soweto giants Orlando Pirates confirmed their 31-man first-team squad numbers for the 2019/20 season with no mention of goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo as he was notably omitted from the list. According to the clubâ€™s official website, with every new season, players vacate, and new players come into the team and with that numbers are made available or re-allocated. While there is no science to the allocation of numbers, to some players the numbers are chosen based on position, while others superstitiously choose what they deem to be their lucky numbers. Ntsikelelo Nyauza has moved from no. 2 to no. 5 while defensive midfielder Ben Motshwari has downgraded from the high numbers, moving down to no. 6. As for the new acquisitions: Gabadinho Mhango has been allocated no. 7; Siphesihle Ndlovu no. 8; Fortune Makaringe no. 15; Bongani Sam no. 19; Kabelo Dlamini no. 8; and Tshegofatso Mabasa no. 16.
