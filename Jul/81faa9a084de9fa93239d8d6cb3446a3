GOGO Josephine was sick for 40 years! The hospital staff could not tell her why. But now she is getting better and can even walk on her own. And this is all thanks to sangoma Gcobani Xabanisa (46), who did not give her muthi, but helped her to thwasa. Gogo Josephine Makeng (67) from Gugulethu, Cape Town told Daily Sun she used to have strange dreams, but never thought it could be a call from the ancestors. “I never consulted sangomas. I never got answers about where my problems came from,” she said. Gogo Josephine got so sick she ended up in a wheelchair. She said she dreamt about a man who looked like sangoma Gcobani who could help her. “I was shocked when he came to my house because he lives down the street. He told me I needed to thwasa and follow the ancestral calling. “I never looked back since that day five years ago. I can walk on my own now without the need of a wheelchair. Whenever I have a problem, I call him.” On Saturday, Gcobani and other sangomas gathered in Gugulethu for gogo Josephine’s cleansing ceremony because she recently lost her child. “In our culture, if sangomas lose a child, they have to be cleansed so they can work properly,” he said. Gogo Josephine’s daughter Nthabiseng told the People’s Paper: “She is our pillar of strength. We have peace of mind now that she is no longer sick.”
