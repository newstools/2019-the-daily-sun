PARAMEDICS and firefighters held a peaceful march through the Joburg CBD yesterday. This came after they attended a prayer service for their safety at the Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Soweto. During their march, they handed over a memorandum at Gauteng Police headquarters asking for cops to escort them when they were working. The march came after a number of attacks on emergency officials. Emergency services acting chief Rapulane Monageng said they wanted to raise awareness about recent attacks. “Emergency services personnel around the country face the daily risk of being attacked while on duty,” he said. “They are committed to helping and caring for others and they deserve respect and gratitude for the work they do.” Earlier this month, Joburg Metro police head David Tembe announced officers would escort ambulances and fire trucks to hot spot areas. Last month an ambulance in Cosmo City was attacked with stones while the paramedic crew was attending to a patient. On 27 June a crew responded to a domestic violence incident in Dobsonville, Soweto. While the crew was busy treating the patient two gunmen opened the ambulance door and robbed the crew of their belongings.
