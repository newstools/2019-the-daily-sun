SOUTH African strikers need to develop a killer instinct and work harder on their finishing if they are to reach the top level in world football. This is the opinion of Arsenal legend Ian Wright. The 55-year-old was speaking after watching the Carling Black Label Cup between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. It has been seven seasons since the Absa Premiership had a 20-goal striker, something that does not sit well with the football fanatics in the country. The last player to hit the 20 goal mark in Mzansi’s top flight was Siyabonga Nomvethe in the 2011-12 season in the colours of Moroka Swallows. Wright, who is Arsenal’s second-highest all time scorer after Thierry Henry, believes local strikers need to push themselves harder to reach the level seen in Europe. “It comes down to how much you want to practice in respect of your own finishing,” said Wright when he was asked how local forwards can improve in front of goal. “I finished every day after practice - finish with my left foot and my right foot. There is so much that goes into it. To just sit and say the guys are not scoring enough goals, it’s quite a damning thing to say for me personally. “I concentrated on hitting the target even in training. I never messed around at any stage to miss the target. So, it’s not something that you all of a sudden start producing the players that can score goals, but it’s up to the players themselves to want to get better, watch the best. “See which midfielders you’ve got around you and it’s up to the coaches to make sure they can get the ball into areas where forwards can score goals.” Wright also revealed that he is a huge admirer of former FC Porto and Bafana Bafana’s highest all time scorer, Benni McCarthy. “I could talk about Benni McCarthy. He was somebody that when I left Arsenal, I said to Arsene, ‘get Benni McCarthy’ because he is one of the best finishers I’ve seen in and around that time,” said Wright.
