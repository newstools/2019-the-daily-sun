SOWETO giants Kaizer Chiefs have launched their new home and away jersey for the 2019/20 season. What are your thoughts on this one?   The home shirt is confirmed as the previously leaked one which was handed over to American Hip Hop artists and radio show host Sway Calloway – containing a “distinctive and energetic pattern” according to Chiefs’ statement. The away jersey, meanwhile, retains a crisp white front and back, embellished with the classic gold and black trim on the sleeves and neck.“The new kit represents our vision for the new season. This year we’re resetting; resetting our minds to reignite the passion and energy of the Amakhosi,” Chiefs Marketing Director Jessica Motaung said in a club statement.“As with the home jersey, this is another nod to our rich history. We decided to pay tribute to our white jersey that was donned by legends and former players like Thabo Mooki, Collins Mbesuma, Jimmy Tau, Siphiwe Tshabalala, Knowledge Musona, Kaizer Motaung Jnr and Jabu Pule.” Amakhosi are set to debut the new kit on Saturdays Carling Black Label Cup Soweto Derby against Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium at 3pm.
