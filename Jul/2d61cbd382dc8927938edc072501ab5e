FATOU’S the world’s oldest living gorilla. She’s estimated to have been born in 1957 in the wild. She was brought from West Africa to France by a sailor in 1959, and then taken by the Berlin Zoo, where she’s being kept. In 1974 she gave birth to the first gorilla to be raised in Berlin, Dufte. She celebrated her 61st birthday on 13 April last year. Since the death of Colo after her 60th birthday in January 2017, Faou’s the oldest living gorilla in the world, together with Trudy from the US. Fatou and Trudy are also the oldest ever confirmed gorillas.
