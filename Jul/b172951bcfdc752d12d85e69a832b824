 NEWLY appointed MEC for Arts, Sports and Culture in Gauteng
Mbali Hlophe, has prioritized the completion of the iconic H.M Pitjie Stadium
in Mamelodi, Tshwane. At the age of 36, Hlophe is the youngest member of the
executive council in Gauteng and she promises actions in her department.  Hlophe delivered the department‘s Budget Vote at the Gauteng
Legislature in Joburg today.  She is also forging ahead with the controversial
Combi-Courts and also wants to build libraries across the province.  According to Hlophe’s maiden speech, H.M Pitjie Stadium will
be completed by 30 October this year. The home of South African champions
Mamelodi Sundowns, has been under construction for several years.  But if the department's words are to be believed, this year
the famous stadium of Mzansi football will be opened for business.  Sports and Recreation have been allocated R 351 million.  Hlophe highlighted the importance of completing libraries
that were not completed last year and in the process build more libraries to
help to motivate the youth to study and have something to fallen back on when
their professional careers come to an end. She is hoping that youth in Gauteng
will have better access of information through libraries.  Hlophe, who read a ten page speech in front of her parents,
also promised to reward the province’s living legends while they are still
alive at the Gauteng Sports Awards scheduled to take place in September. She
promised to bring change in the province.   While members of the opposition parties congratulated Hlophe
on her maiden speech, they also criticized her department and predecessor Faith
“Madam” Combi-Court Mazibuko for under spending their department's budget by
seven percent in the past financial year. Premier of Gauteng David Makhura was
also impressed with Hlophe’s maiden speech and congratulated her. They urged to
utilize the money to improve the sports fields.
