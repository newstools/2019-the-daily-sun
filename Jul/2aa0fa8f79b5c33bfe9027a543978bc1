THE Zwilibi brothers were laid to rest in their home town of Mthatha, Eastern Cape, on Saturday last week. Aphiwe (25) and Sonwabo Zwilibi (18) and their cousin Sikelela (17) were killed while visiting a friend in Lower Crossroads two weeks ago. Family member Nombulelo Zwilibi thanked everyone who supported them. “Without the support we’ve been getting from friends, family and neighbours, we wouldn’t be able to carry this burden on our own,” said Nombulelo. “No parent or family deserves what we’ve been going through. Some days are better while on others we struggle to even eat.” She said they’d only start healing once they found out why the brothers were killed. “All we know is that police investigations are still ongoing. We want to see the people who did this rotting in jail,” she said. Nombulelo said the family was grateful to anonymous donors who donated money so the brothers could be buried. “Those people played a huge role. We’re thankful because we didn’t have to worry where we’d get money for the burial,” said Nombulelo. Neighbour Lusindiso Maninjwa (45) said residents would give the family support. “They’ll need it because what happened really broke them. We’ll pray for them,” he said.
