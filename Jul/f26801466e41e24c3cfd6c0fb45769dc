A PUPIL had to be hospitalised for smoke inhalation after a classroom caught fire on Tuesday. According to a worker at LG Holele High School in Ga-Rankuwa zone 2, Tshwane, the fire started after hours. “There were matric pupils in class and two teachers were busy with orals,” said the worker. “The whole block was on fire and everything was burnt. “The block has two HOD offices, two exam halls, three offices, a consumer studies hall and a home economics kitchen.” The worker said everything was back to normal by yesterday. Parents were relieved no one was injured. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said: “It’s really concerning and unfortunate that we experienced such a loss. We’re not sure what caused the fire, but an investigation has been launched.” Captain Matthews Nkoadi confirmed that a pupil inhaled smoke. “The cause was apparently burning grass outside the building and the fire spread,” he said. “The person who started the fire outside the school is unknown.” A case of arson was opened and investigations were under way.
