NTOKOZWENI villagers yesterday said after 25 years of democracy, they were still waiting for services. Residents of the village near Mthatha were speaking at an imbizo attended by water and sanitation deputy ministers Pamela Tshwete and David Mahlobo. Zukiswa Bhakatha (51) said she still lived in a two-roomed mud house with her 83-year-old mum and 16-year-old son after applying for an RDP over 20 years ago. “We are really struggling here, especially where water is concerned. We share water with pigs and cows, and sometimes get sick as a result,” she said. Nkosi Jongisizwe Makaula said the deputy minister’s meeting with residents gave them hope things would change. Tshwete said: “We have heard your cries and will work with OR Tambo District mayor Thokozile Sokhanyile to deliver services.” Mahlobo urged residents not to dump used nappies and asked the municipality to act quickly. “We will support the municipality. We want it to drain the pit toilets. We will also build 17 houses for families affected by natural disasters,” he said. The officials said they would pass on people’s concerns about schools and clinics to the relevant departments. The municipality’s Dumisani Mjokovana said water tanks would visit every village from today and by next month, villagers would have running water.
