GAUTENG Health MEC Bandile Masuku on Friday welcomed the sentencing of a former state medical examiner. This came after the Kempton Park Regional Court in Ekurhuleni found Dr James Mwesigwa guilty of theft, violating a body, defeating and obstructing the administration of justice and not following National Health Act regulations. Mwesigwa was sentenced to 10 years behind bars. In November 2013, Daily Sun reported that he was arrested and suspended from work at Diepkloof Mortuary in Soweto. This after being caught trying to steal a brain and a heart of an mlungu named Alida Scheepers. Masuku said the conviction would send a strong message against crimes at health facilities. Gobela Grace Ndlovu said sometimes sangomas increased their power through human sacrifice. “They call themselves prophets and sangomas but many didn’t go through the thwasa process and aren’t even gifted,” she said. “They use a snake called mamlambo, which tells them what it needs to be fed, which is often human body parts. Failure to do so can kill them. Those who consult them often want quick fixes for wealth and success.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said using human body parts was pure evil. “I’m never interested in helping those who ask for help to harm other people,” he said. Phephsile Maseko of the Traditional Healers Organisation said those selling and buying human body parts must be brought to book. “Traditional medicines prepared by honest traditional healers for healing include minerals and animal parts. The use of human body parts is evil.”
