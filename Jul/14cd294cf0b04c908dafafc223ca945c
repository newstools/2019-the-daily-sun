SOCIAL worker Nivan Mahlake (36) wants to improve the lives of people living with disabilities. Nivan who comes from Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga is a programme coordinator in Soweto. He is responsible for various activities, including identification, help with equipment, awareness campaigns, skills development and support groups. “We are aware of discrimination, violation of the rights of persons with disabilities and there are also killings of persons with albinism,” said Nivan. “If these can be stopped, I will have achieved my goal as a social worker.” He said growing up, he was called lekgowa la tlhaga, which means whitey of the forest. “At first it was painful but now I don’t mind because they don’t understand my condition.” He said it was his duty to make people aware of disabilities. He said albinism occurs when the production of melanin, the pigmentation that colours skin, hair and eyes, is reduced. “It is a lifelong condition. Usually individuals will have reddish, brown or white hair. Others will have brownish, pinkish or white eyes because of the lack of melanin and that is why our skin is sensitive to the sun.” Nivan said his biggest problem was the shortage of schools for persons with disabilities in Gauteng. He said most workplaces were not accessible to persons with disabilities.
