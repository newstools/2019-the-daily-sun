CHILDREN are being made to clean and empty toilets. Yesterday, parents at Mohlophe Primary School in Ga-Mphethi Village outside Burgersfort, Limpopo found out that their children were told by the school principal to clean and empty the toilets. Kids are forced to pack kak in white sacks and take it to the nearby bush in wheelbarrows. A 31-year-old mum who lives near the school said she became worried when she saw a group of pupils digging kak from the toilets. “They were with their teacher, who was helping them,” she said. Parent Joseph Lewele (47) said he formed a task team and went to the local educational circuit. “After we reported the matter, the principal was called. We don’t know what happened afterwards,” he said. When the SunTeam tried to speak to SGB chairwoman Corny Nkwana, the principal came and ordered her not to speak to the media. Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo said everyone has the right to dignity, which should be respected at all times. “We are disappointed and will get to the bottom of these allegations,” said Boshielo. DA provincial leader Jacques Smalle confirmed filing a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission to investigate the department’s failure to provide adequate toilet facilities and sanitation at Mohlophe Primary.
