SOME loathe it and some prefer it. Bafana Bafana will for
the first time in their history, be subjected to the much-spoken about VAR (Video
Assistant Referee). Caf will introduce the technology driven mechanism in the
Last 8 stage of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, starting with tonight’s ­–
Senegal v Benin, Bafana Bafana v Nigeria 9pm. The VAR, which was introduced to minimise wrong refereeing
decisions, has come under attack from many football experts. VAR has been
accused of killing the human element of the game and also for delaying the
game, resulting in the team losing their momentum while waiting for the referee
to make his decision. It will be tested for the first time at the Afcon, after
it failed dismally in the 2019 Caf Champions League final between Esperance v
Wydada Casablanca. Do you think that VAR will influence tonight’s match between
Bafana v Super Eagles? Have you say…
