CONTINUED train delays, mostly sparked by the theft of overhead cables, have been making commuters furious for some time. Employers also suffer as their companies lose a lot of money when production is reduced because staff are late. Last Thursday, a joint operation involving the police and security staff from the Passenger Railway Agency Services , Transnet, eThekwini municipality and Telkom stormed several scrapyards around Phoenix, Durban, to stop scrap metal theft. They raided the yards in search of items such as copper and pole clips stolen from their organisations. A cop said the law enforcement units embarked on the raid following a tip-off. “We found clips and mass poles and are going to take them away with us,” she said. A Prasa official said scrap metal thieves were behind most of the train disruptions in the country. “When these items are stolen, train services are disrupted and this results in long delays. “This affects our passengers badly as they arrive late for work,” he said. Scrap collector Mthokozisi Dube (43) was disappointed when he found that the scrapyard where he usually sells scrap metal was closed. “This is the only way I can make money,” he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant- Colonel Thulani Zwane said four suspects were arrested during the raids.
