FORMER Orlando Pirates midfielder Mpho Makola has joined Cape Town City. Makola was one of the players released by the Buccaneers after the arrival of 10 new players, among them Maritzburg United duo Siphesihle Ndlovu and Fortune Makaringe. The former Bafana Bafan midfielder made well over 170 appearances for the Buccaneers. Makola was linked with a number of PSL teams but the Citizens have won the race for his signature. City coach Benni McCarthy has made his admiration for Makola no secret and will hope his former Bucs teammate can fire them to greater heights.
