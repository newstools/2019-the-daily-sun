Their story continues to inspire up-and-coming musicians to work harder. Kwaito legends Trompies say it feels good to have a platform to express themselves and celebrate 25 years of Kalawa Jazmee. Kalawa Jazmee, the independent record label they’re signed under, has housed some of Mzansi’s most popular and multi-award winning acts. Against all odds, Trompies have managed to stick together even when the going seemed tough. It all started with a vision to own their music and start a company. But starting a black record label wasn’t easy. Members include Jairus “Jakarumba” Nkwe, Zynne “Mahoota” Sibika, Mandla “Spikiri” Mofokeng, Eugene Mthethwa and Emmanuel “Mjokes” Matsane. Their aim is to have their story told both on stage and the big screen. On Wednesday last week, the group announced they were working on a documentary and a play that highlights the journey the label had travelled. Spikiri said they were happy to have survived and live to tell the tale. Eugene said for many years people have been saying kwaito was long dead. According to the star, what the public doesn’t understand is that kwaito isn’t just a genre but a culture that helped youth back then to deal with reality. “Kwaito is a culture and we’re happy that today creatives are coming together to help document the trials and tribulation of Kalawa Jazmee and Trompies. “They want to tell beyond the music because we were changing the narrative from 1976 to post 1994 for young people who were coming out from homes that were poor, homes that were constantly ravaged by politics and apartheid regime. We’ve suffered a lot and this is one culture that made us survive hit men. “We’re still here as a company that owns its material and things that many artists died fighting for.” He said theirs is an attempt to record the history of kwaito for the next generations to love and cherish.
