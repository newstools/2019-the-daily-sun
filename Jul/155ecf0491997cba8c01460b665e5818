 MAYOR
Zandile Gumede’s supporters leader Mzo Dube have vowed to continue putting
pressure on the ANC to bring back the mayor. This after
the state refused to place him on the roll today, citing lack of evidence
linking him to any crime. Dube was
supposed to take a stand together with other six ANC supporters in Durban Magistrate
Court, but there was confusion when his name wasn't called by the prosecutor
Johan Sibiya. Dube looked
confused until the court was adjourned where he rushed to his lawyer Bulelani
Mazomba. The lawyer
told Dube charges against him had been withdrawn but prosecutor Sibiya, he said
withdrawn is not the correct word. He said the
state decided not to prosecute him for now and the matter is off the roll for
now. Magistrate Gram Field postponed the matter for the other six to 12
September. Speaking
outside the court Dube said he was confused on what exactly is going on. He said he
was confused because even his lawyer didn't brief him before the case started. He said
although he got some relief, he can't celebrate until other comrades are free
too. "I
can't claim victory yet until all comrades are free. I’m really confused why
the state would say there is no enough against me because I was arrested
together with these comrades. We can't
claim victory for now, you will never trust these people, may be they are
backing off or they are up to something but the struggle continues,” said Dube. His lawyer
said the state said there wasn't enough evidence to enrol his matter because
the cop that arrested him failed to identify him except to say what he was
wearing. The lawyer
said he is expecting the state to withdraw charges against all his clients. He
represented all the accused. The
supporters were arrested on Thursday during a chaotic march in the city centre where
more than 200 supporters blockaded busy Pixley kaSeme street demanding the
mayor's return to office. Police
charged them for obstructing the road and for failing to obey police orders.
