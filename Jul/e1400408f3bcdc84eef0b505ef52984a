Known as the People's Race, the 2019 Soweto Marathon is approaching its biggest entry number yet at a whopping 40 000 runners. By last Friday, the half marathon was 98% full with the other distances following closely. The deadline to enter is 31 JULY 2019. “The numbers are interesting,” says Soweto Marathon Trust Chairman Sello Khunou. “In the marathon, we have nearly 10 000 male runners, and just under 2500 females registered." "But in the half marathon as well as the 10km, it’s the ladies who outweigh the men by a fair margin."The race will take place on 3 November 2019 and the start and finish points will be at the FNB Stadium. The route honours Soweto’s rich history and runners pass eight significant heritage sites on the marathon route, namely the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, Walter Sisulu Square, the Regina Mundi Catholic Church, Credo Mutwa Cultural Village, Morris Isaacson High School & June 16 Memorial Acre, Vilakazi Street and the Hector Pieterson Memorial.
