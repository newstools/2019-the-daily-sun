TO say the Springboks go into battle against the All Blacks will be stating the obvious. There is a lot of mutual respect between the two sides, but on the pitch it’s the bone-crunching tackles and massive hits with both teams chasing victory. Nothing but a bruising encounter can be expected when the sworn-enemies renew hostilities at Wespac Stadium in Wellington on Saturday (9.35am SA time). Bok coach Rassie Erasmus has named a much-changed starting line-up from the one that beat the Wallabies at Ellis Park last weekend, with only Eben Etzebeth, Makazole Mapimpi and Pieter-Steph du Toit retaining their places. Duane Vermeulen takes over from Etzebeth as captain with regular skipper Siya Kolisi likely to be involved in Currie Cup action this weekend as he continues his recovery from injury. “It’s important that we continue to build on our leadership for this important year, especially while our regular skipper, Siya Kolisi, is out of action because of injury rehabilitation,” Erasmus said.
