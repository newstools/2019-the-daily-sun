Jacob Zuma's boxing buddy, son Duduzane Zuma will know his fate today as judgement will be handed down at the Randburg Magistrates court in the north of Johannesburg. Duduzane is facing
charges of culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving relating to the
incident where he lost control of his Porsche 911 and crashed into a taxi on
the M1 highway in Johannesburg, the incident resulted in the death of Phumzile
Dube. Duduzane's lawyers told the court that the 911 was prone to aquaplaning (when a layer of water builds between the wheels of the vehicle and the road surface, leading to a loss of traction) and experts have told the courts that the there was a pool of water on the road on the night of the incident. State Prosecutor Yusuf Baba told the court that there's evidence that proves Duduzane is guilty of causing the crash, that he failed to take the necessary precautions on the rainy summers night and he failed to be a sensible driver.
