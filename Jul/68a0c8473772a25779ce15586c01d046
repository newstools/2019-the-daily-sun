  AFROTAINMENT boss and Durban's "Mayor Of Entertainment" DJ Tira is very disappointed with his music fans. This after he claims that they do not buy or stream his music through downloads, and he further said that they do not buy tickets to his show on time! The DJ who recently shot a music video for his new song, Thank You Mr DJ in London, made it seems like he did not get the support he expects from his fans. He posted a video on his social media platforms addressing some of the things that he was not happy about. On the video he says: "Why is no one is talking about the event that I'm doing for the ladies on 31 August? You are busy telling me that Thank You Mr DJ is the song of the year but you don't download the song. What is wrong with you? Like where are the videos of you guys playing Mr DJ? I don't see them." The No Rush hitmaker was talking about his upcoming event that he is currently organizing for the ladies set to take place on 31 August 2019 at Botanical Garden in Durban during Women's Month. In the event he features an all female line-up,closing off Women's Month on a positive note.  Tira then went on to announce that he will be dropping his latest single, a hip-hop song which features music heavy weights, Kwesta, Duncan, Beast and Joocy this coming Friday.
