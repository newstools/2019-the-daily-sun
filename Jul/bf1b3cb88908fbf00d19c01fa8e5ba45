THE entertainment industry is a cut-throat sector that many find difficult to crack, especially when they are young and inexperienced. Twenty-year-old actor Paballo Mavundla knows this all too well. After bagging his first acting role in Mzansi Magic’s The Herd and going on to star as “Crazy J” in SABC1’s Generations: The Legacy, he’s steadily climbing the showbiz ladder. “There aren’t enough roles for young people, so securing work becomes challenging,” he told Daily Sun this week. Like many of his peers starting out in the industry, Paballo admitted that he, too, had auditioned for many roles without any luck. However, this changed when he was given a role in The Herd alongside heavyweights such as Winnie Ntshaba and Sello Maake Ka-Ncube. When he got the job his parents’ fears were allayed. “They were excited when I joined Generations. Now, they’re getting used to seeing me on screen,” the star said. While he enjoys the preferential treatment he gets wherever he goes because of his new-found fame, he concedes that there are unrealistic expectations that come with it. “There are definitely perks to be a recognisable face. I get great service at retail stores. On the other hand, because I’m on TV, I’m expected to drive around in a fancy car, instead of using public transport. But I’m a young actor and I’m still trying to establish myself”.
