MOTORISTS have been warned to expect harsh treatment for speeding, driving into oncoming traffic or driving in the emergency lane. On Friday, while presenting the Joburg Metro police monthly performance statistics, chief David Tembe announced that a new unit would focus on reckless driving. He was joined by Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba and MMC for public safety Michael Sun. Tembe said they will improve traffic control by hitting reckless and negligent drivers hard, as well as those driving under the influence of alcohol. Metro police spokesman Xolani Fihla said motorists found breaking the rules of the road can expect to be arrested on the spot. “The unit will be launched in two weeks. We will be strict on traffic violations, including those who skip red robots. “They will be taken straight to jail,” he said. The unit will use unmarked cars. “The use of unmarked vehicles will help the unit spot those driving recklessly without them knowing. They will be followed and arrested,” said Fihla. During the month of May, the Metro police recorded 211 accidents on the city’s highways and 11 deaths. At least two motorists were arrested for reckless and negligent driving and 61 for drunk driving.
