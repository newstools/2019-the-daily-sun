A TEENAGER’S dream of becoming a pilot is fading after he was assaulted at school. For three months, the 16-year-old pupil from Qaqawuli kasi, Port Elizabeth, had been sitting at home nursing injuries to his liver and kidneys. The grade 8 pupil at Thubelihle High School said he cried every day when he saw his schoolmates going to school. “During break, we were throwing stones out of the window and a classmate accused me of hitting him with a stone. “He then threw me down and jumped on me wearing safety boots,” he said. “I’m hurt because I can’t play soccer or go to school as I need an operation. Doctors say I will get an infection if I go to school.” His 46-year-old aunt said she received a call on 22 April to rush to school as her nephew was injured. “I found him lying on the grass in severe pain. He was taken to Dora Nginza Hospital and X-rays showed his liver was injured. He was transferred to Livingstone Hospital for surgery,” she said. She said her nephew had to go to Port Elizabeth Provincial Hospital three times a week and all his foster care grant money went towards transport. “Next month, one of his kidneys will be removed, but no action was taken by the police or the school against the bully. A case of assault was opened, but the bully is still on the loose,” she said. Provincial Education Department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said he was not aware of the incident, but would follow it up. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said in such cases, cops allow the education department, parents and social workers to handle issues first before they intervene.
