KZN HEALTH MEC Nomagugu Simelane- Zulu visited Addington Hospital in Durban on Wednesday. On Monday, patients including newborn babies and children had to be evacuated from the 7th, 9th and 13th floors of the hospital, following a fire that started in a pile of rubbish next to a service lift. Other fires apparently also broke out seven months ago near the fire escape routes, where rubbish bags were kept for collection. At times, the lifts in the hospital also stopped working, affecting people’s movements, as well as delivery of food and rubbish removal. The MEC told management to act quickly to ensure the smooth functioning of the lifts. She wanted to know why the service provider didn’t ensure they were working. “We were told the fire started outside the service lift, which was not working. The rubbish from the wards is kept next to it if it isn’t working. That is where the fire came from.” The MEC said they asked head of department Musa Gumede and senior management to investigate. “We are going to relook the service provider’s contract. We will do whatever needs to be done legally to get a proper level of service.”
