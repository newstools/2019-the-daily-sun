UMLAZI Taxi Rank was empty yesterday after MNR Association drivers went on strike. They went on strike after two of their colleagues were shot dead in the kasi, south of Durban, on Tuesday night. It was believed the killings were related to an ongoing dispute between Engonyameni and MNR associations over routes. According to sources, the trouble started on Monday when MNR members allegedly stopped Engonyameni taxis from going through Umlazi. A source said Engonyameni opened a route to Durban two months ago, angering MNR. He said the killings could be revenge attacks. An MNR driver, who asked not to be named for fear of victimisation, said they decided to stop working as they feared for their lives. “We will only go back once our bosses sort out their problems,” he said. Cop spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Umlazi cops were investigating two cases of murder and the motive was unknown. Attempts to get comment from the associations failed. The SunTeam was chased away by guards at MNR offices while trying to get comment. Transport spokesman Mluleki Mtungwa said officials were sent to meet members of the associations.
