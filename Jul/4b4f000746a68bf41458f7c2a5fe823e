JABULILE Ngcobo hates it when people living with disabilities are treated with pity. The 47-year-old from KwaMashu, KZN, started an organisation to help people living with disabilities live with their difficulties. Jabulile told Daily Sun she contracted polio at the age of five. She said she used crutches until last year. Now she has a wheelchair because her body became too heavy for the crutches. “In 1999 started a group for people living with disabilities. “We met and started making beads,” she said. In 2013 I was invited to teach kids at the special school how to create beads. “I ended up living there for three years.” Jabulile said in 2016 she opened the Hlahlindlela Club to help people living with disabilities learn different skills. “I started the organisation because I saw a lot of people like me were ashamed to leave their houses because of discrimination. “I wanted them to have something to look forward to and to see their own potential.” Jabulile said the group has 42 members. She said she was glad to change many lives and the away people saw those living with disabilities. “We teach them knitting, beadwork, cane work, as well as how to make washing and fruit baskets. “We have a counselling programme for abused people. “We also share information about HIV/Aids and sexually transmitted diseases,” said Jabulile. “We encourage members to further their studies as well.”
