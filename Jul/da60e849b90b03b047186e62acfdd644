HIS three-roomed shack is in a congested area at the bottom of a cliff. This makes getting around, let alone going to the road at the top, a monumental struggle for the family of Bhekuyise Mhlongo (61) from KwaMancinza, north of Durban. To enable his disabled, 24-year-old daughter Zama Sikhosana, to go to the doctor, Bhekuyise built a small bridge in 2016 using corrugated iron. “When she has a doctor’s appointment I have to ask our neighbour to help me carry her into the wheelchair. “Then we push her out of the house and up to the road at the top. “Before I built the bridge, I struggled a lot when I had to push her out of our yard as it is not suitable for a wheelchair. “The bridge helps me get her out easily,” he said. But he said the bridge was no longer stable as other residents were also using it. Ntombifikile Mkhize (39) said she always used the bridge. “It helps us get up to the road. We’ve reported this to the councillor but he doesn’t do anything,” she said. Bhekuyise’s wife, Elizabeth Sikhosana (60), said she spoke to the councillor in 2017 about it. He promised to help move them to an RDP house. “Two years have passed and we’ve heard nothing. We’re now pleading with the eThekwini municipality to intervene in the matter,” she said. Councillor Simon Khuboni said he was still working on getting an RDP house for the family. eThekwini municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said: “Social workers from the human settlements unit have been asked to conduct an assessment of the needs of theis family.”
