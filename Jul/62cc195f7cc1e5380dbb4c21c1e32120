EVERY year, gogos and mkhulus from Diepsloot look forward to Mandela Day. The day has a special place in their hearts as they know without fail they will receive blankets from their councillor. But this year, things didn’t go as they had anticipated. Now the gogos and madalas from the kasi claim they were disappointed by their councillor. Maria Ramaoka (54) told Daily Sun they got gifts every year on the day, but this time around the councillor failed them. “We woke up early on the day to do our 67 minutes at a nearby school before going to the communal hall to get our gifts. “When we got there, the councillor told us he was tired and we should come back on Friday to collect our gifts,” said Maria. She said they saw blankets in the office but decided to leave. “We left in confidence because we saw the blankets. We were queuing at the hall as early as 5am on Friday, but a security woman on duty told us she had been speaking to the councillor and he’d said there no longer were any blankets,” she said. Madala Phineus Mailula (75) said the councillor had said he received 560 blankets, but when they called him, he’d said he gave them to volunteers. “He takes us for fools. He said we should collect the blankets on Friday, but all of a sudden he gave them away. Why did he give away the blankets because he promised to give them to us?” said Phineus. Councillor Abraham Mabuke said there were a lot of pensioners in Diepsloot and they were unable to accommodate everyone. “Those who didn’t get blankets should wait for next year. “They should have come early to the event like everyone else. Maybe they would have been lucky,” said Mabuke.
