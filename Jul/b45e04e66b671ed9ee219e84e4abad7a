COPS are investigating security guards accused of assaulting a resident on Friday. The guards, who are contracted to a company at Uthingo Park in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, were captured on video during the incident. There was reportedly physical fighting between guards and protesting residents. The video shows the victim being hit on the upper body with the back a rifle. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the residents allegedly wanted to take the guard’s firearm, leading to the fight. “While acknowledging and appreciating the role played by the private security industry in the fight against crime, excessive force amounts to brutality and is punishable by law,” he said. Hlathi warned security companies to contact the cops if residents were causing disturbances. Police arrested three suspects. They are expected to appear in the Witbank Magistrates Court today on assault charges. George Xaba, a spokesman for Emalahleni Housing Company, the agency responsible for running Uthingo Park, said: “The video and the response to it made it seem as if guards were in the wrong, but they were reacting to the victim’s behaviour.” He said they opened a case of assault against the victim.
