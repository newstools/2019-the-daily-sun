RESIDENTS of Jabavu, Soweto, took their anger out on a customer care service centre on Friday. They petrol bombed a City Power customer service centre after experiencing electricity outages for several weeks. City of Joburg finance department spokeswoman Happy Zondi confirmed the incident. But MMC Funzela Ngobeni said minimal damage was caused. Said Ngobeni: “The City of Joburg condemns this in the strongest terms and will ensure those responsible face the full might of the law. “No employees or residents were injured as a result of the bombing. “We’re putting measures in place to ensure that the centre continues operating.” Ngobeni said citizens had the right to protest, but that it was wrong for residents to destroy public property. “Such actions are unjustified because they impact the community and prevent access to basic municipal services,” he said. The MMC said more security guards and Metro cops were sent to the area following the incident. He said cases of arson and malicious damage to property were opened. JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun that they were dispatched to the area to access the situation. “I can’t provide any updates at the moment but we understand that the city has since opened a case against the perpetrators,” he said.
