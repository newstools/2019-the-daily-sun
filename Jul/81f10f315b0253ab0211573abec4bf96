PROTESTERS set a truck on fire, broke a security hut’s windows, and pulled down fences at a fire station on Monday night. Gatvol residents of Lotus in Gugulethu kasi wanted Councillor Sonwabo Ngxumza to allow them to rebuild shacks demolished by the municipality, so they caused chaos at Fezeka Fire Station. “They came on Thursday afternoon,” a security guard said. The guard said the councillor did come and they spoke. “They came back twice on Monday but the councillor wasn’t there.” When the SunTeam called Ngxumza, he wasn’t available. Resident Mkhuseli Mtotywa (45) said they came back at night but didn’t cause damage. “Security didn’t allow us inside.” The guard said residents were stopped on Sunday night but came back on Monday, and that’s when the damage was caused. Another guard said he feared for his life after angry protesters threatened him. City of Cape Town spokesman Luthando Tyhalibongo said a truck and a security hut were vandalised.
