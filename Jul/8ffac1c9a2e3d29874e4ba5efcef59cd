HER successful recycling project has been on fire twice in three days. Magdeline Tsoeu (51) believes the fires may have been started by jealous people who want to destroy her business. The Kehelelwe Recycling project is based in Phase 6, Bloemfontein and 20 people have been left jobless after the warehouse was burnt. Firefighters were able to put out the fire that was started on Friday but the warehouse was burnt again on Sunday. Magdeline said she’s been renting the warehouse since last year. “The workers collect cardboard boxes and newspapers from supermarkets. We press the bundles of boxes with a pressing machine and send the paper to Gauteng,” said Magdeline. She said that was how she made some money for herself and paid her workers. “Now the fire has destroyed our livelihood and we are left stranded. I have lost everything. “The two pressing machines and a big machine which cost R3 800 as well as a generator we rented were destroyed.” She said she didn’t know who was behind the evil flames. Warehouse owner Malcolm Jacobs said: “I moved into the warehouse in 1993. I stay here to protect the equipment. On Friday night I got up to drink water when I saw the structure was on fire. The fire started again on Sunday while I was watching TV,” he said. Free State Warrant Officer Lorraine Earle said an arson case was being investigated.
