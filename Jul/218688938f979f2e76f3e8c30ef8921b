EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu has denied having a friendly relationship with Johann Rupert. He was responding to claims made in a new book titled Stellenbosch Mafia: Inside the Billionaire’s Club by journalist Pieter du Toit, which were reported on by Sunday newspapers. On Sunday, Shivambu tweeted that he had no relationship with Rupert, had never asked for any form of organisational or personal assistance from Rupert, or received any. He later tweeted again, saying he didn’t refuse to comment on the allegations, as Du Toit claimed, and had WhatsApp messages from February in which he stated his position. Du Toit alleges that Shivambu spent time with Rupert at an exclusive wine estate in Stellenbosch to discuss business and politics. Party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said in 2017 Shivambu was asked by black businesspeople with a hospital licence to help them form a partnership with a reputable hospital management company. He said there was a meeting with representatives of Mediclinic and Remgro, Rupert’s investment company. Ndlozi claimed after Shivambu last year warned President Cyril Ramaphosa to be careful of white monopoly capital, he received a message from Rupert, which read: “I have not looted anything and am very disappointed in you for this BS. Thought you were more honourable and intelligent than this. Goodbye and good luck.”
