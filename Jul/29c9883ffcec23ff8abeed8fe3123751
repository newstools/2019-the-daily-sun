ONYEKACHI Okechukwu will spend the rest of his life behind bars. The 39-year-old was sentenced to two life sentences by the Tshwane Regional Court yesterday. He abused and tortured two female victims for years. Spokesman Lloyd Ramovha said the Hawks serious organised crime investigating unit arrested Okechukwu in 2013 in a brothel in Tshwane, where he kept two female victims captive. Ramovha said the two were rescued and taken to a place of safety, where they received counselling and life skills sessions. “The two victims were subjected to witnessing and experiencing physical and sexual violence, threats and encouragement of their addictions. “It was proven beyond doubt that Okechukwu played a significant role in the trafficking of both victims. “He exploited their positions of vulnerability and physically and psychologically controlled them.” Hawks head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya praised the investigating team.
