KAIZER Chiefs has on Wednesday announced the signing of 23-year-old defender Yagan Sasman on a three-year deal from Ajax Cape Town. Sasman becomes the Glamour Boys' fifth signing ahead of the 2019/2020 Absa Premiership campaign and is a versatile defender who can play as a left-back or centre-back. The young defender is a product of the renowned Ajax academy having spent 12 years at the Cape-based club. Head coach Ernst Middendorp has decided in favour of strengthening his defensive options after Sasman was spotted training at Naturena in the past few weeks. Chiefs open their Absa Premiership campaign with a trip to Highlands Park on Sunday at the Makhulong Stadium at 3pm.
