AFTER her mum Sylvia (84) asked her to return home to take care of her, Mampuru Khuto didn’t hesitate. But according to the 55-year-old from Tjiane Village, outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo, her life became a living hell after she moved from Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, in 2017. She told Daily Sun she would find her clothes were ripped up in her wardrobe. She said she was forced to wrap everything in newspaper as she believed a mysterious creature was responsible. “When I arrived, my mum told me everyone’s clothes were being ripped up in their cupboards but I didn’t think it would happen to me. I now feel like this creature is after me,” she said. Mampuru said since she started wrapping her clothes in newspaper, the creature had left her things alone. “What was surprising was only the right side of my clothes and shoes were affected. I no longer sleep properly at night because I know this thing is living with us in the house,” she said. Her mum said she invited pastors to pray at her house last year but the creature didn’t stop terrorising them. “It’s really hard. We don’t even know who will assist us to chase this invisible thing from the house. We really need help from a good sangoma. We tried to consult but there’s no strong sangoma around here,” said gogo Sylvia. SunReaders who can help are urged to call Daily Sun on 011 877 6060.
