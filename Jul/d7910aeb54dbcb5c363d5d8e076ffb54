VEREENIGING residents in the Vaal started their day yesterday with arson, murder and rape claims being made. During an alleged turf war between two rival groups over magoshas and drug dens, members of one group allegedly raped a woman linked to the other gang. A man died when he was apparently set on fire in a house which was torched. Another house was also set alight. The two abandoned houses in Joubert Street were apparently being used as brothels and drug dens by the alleged gang members. A member of one of the groups told Daily Sun a woman was sent to the one house to sell a jacket for a fix. “When she got back, she was told to stay to get high. Two of the men slept with her. One man in the house told the last guy to also sleep with her, which he said he’d do later. “After the two dozed off, the man helped the woman escape. She then came back with her boyfriend and friends and they took revenge.” It is unclear how the houses ended up burnt but it seems the windows were smashed by the woman and her friends. Sibusiso Ntuli (25) said the house was always packed with magoshas and gangsters. “We always see half- dressed women and men coming and going.” Captain Fikile Funda said three cases were being investigated. “We had a call at 5am about a burning house but found it burnt down. We’re investigating cases of murder, rape and arson. We took in two people for questioning.”
