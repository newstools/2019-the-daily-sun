 NATIONAL First Division side Richards Bay FC have signed former Kaizer Chiefs winger Khotso Malope. Malope joined Natal Rich Boyz as a free agent after his contract was terminated by Amakhosi towards the end of last season. Malope is well known in the KwaZulu-Natal province as well as in the NFD as he was one of the key players when defunct Thanda Royal Zulu made history winning the league in style amassing a record of 62 points. In that season under the late coach Roger Sikhakhane, Malope scored three goals in 22 appearances and he will be looking to recapture that old form in the upcoming 2019-20 campaign. The 25-year-old midfielder joins the club alongside goalkeeper Dumisani Msibi who joins from Real Kings and 30-year-old Sibusiso Msomi who has been club less since leaving Platinum Stars in 2018.
