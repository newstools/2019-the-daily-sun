DO not expect Highlands Park new signing Makhehleni Makhaula to hold back when he faces Kaizer Chiefs winger Joseph “Tight” Molangoane. The Lions of the North will host Amakhosi in their opening Absa Premiership match of the 2019-20 season at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Makhaula, who’s game is built on aggressiveness, almost ended the career of Molangaone in the MTN8 quarter-finals in August last year when he was playing for Free State Stars. The 29-year-old broke the former Chippa United winger’s leg. The injury ruled Molangaone out for the entire season. If both players are selected for their respective clubs on Sunday, it will be the first time they would oppose each other since that incident at FNB Stadium. Said Makhaula: “I’ve passed that experience that I broke Tight’s leg. But he (Molangaone) also understands that I was competing. If he plays and I play I’ll still have in the back of my mind that I almost ended his career, but it is the nature of my game. I’m an aggressive player, that is how I play.” However, he added: “I spoke to Tight over the phone after that incident, I apologised. But I have never met him face to face. ” Meanwhile, Makhaula, who made his PSL debut in 2014-15 season for the Bethlehem-based Ea Lla Koto, says leaving Stars was a sad moment. Stars were relegated to the National First Division (NFD) at the end of last season. He departed Stars having been part of the side that won the Nedbank Cup in 2018, the club’s first trophy in the PSL, and first in 24 years. In five seasons with them, Makhaula scored three goals in 94 games. “Stars will always be my family, I’ll always respect them,”said Makhaula. “But as a player, you need to move on. But I’ll never forget them for what they did for me. I’m here at Highlands Park because of them.”
