Yet another horror crash has this time left nine people dead on the N11 between Hendrina and Middelburg in Mpumalanga, said the spokesperson for the MEC for Community Safety in the province. Moeti Mmusi said that at about 16:30, a minibus believed to be transporting mine employees and an articulated truck collided head-on. Eight of the nine people killed in the minibus were burnt beyond recognition. The drivers of both vehicles were stabilised and then taken to hospital for further treatment. "The MEC Gabsile Shabalala is shocked by this accident," said Mmusi. "The N11 seems to be becoming more deadly." The road was closed for several hours to allow for authorities to tend to the scene, and was later partially reopened as a stop-and-go. Russel Meiring from ER24 paramedics said a third vehicle also appeared to have been involved in the crash when their specialists arrived at the scene. "Middelburg Fire Services and local farmers were able to extinguish the blaze after some time," said Meiring. He said there was also a third person who survived the crash, and was also treated for injuries Mmusi said crash investigation experts from the Road Traffic Management Corporation andÂ  safety engineering officials from the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison will immediately commence with investigations. As recently as Thursday the MEC announced during her maiden Policy and Budget Speech presentation that the road is among those that would receive more attention in the current financial year due to the number of crashes there. Mmusi explained that the road tends to switch between double lanes and then narrow again to a single lane so caution is extremely vital when driving there. Shabalala extended her condolences to the bereaved families, and also wished the injured a speedy recovery. The cause of the accident is not known yet. The name of the mine was not released. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/9-people-killed-in-mpumalanga-crash-20190712
