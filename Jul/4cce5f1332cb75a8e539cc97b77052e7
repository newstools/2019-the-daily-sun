GOOD deeds never go unnoticed. The Tshwane Community Policing Forum has thanked a goodwill gesture by Habesha Community. Habesha Community, made up of business people from Eritrea and Ethiopia, donated maize meal, rice, sugar, cooking oil and tea bags to the forum. The donation was handed over to forum members recently at Pretoria Central Police Station. Habesha leader Alemayehu Senbeta said: “We donated groceries to these people because they play a major role in fighting crime.” The donation went to 50 forum members and 12 social workers. Alemayehu said they would continue to donate to different people in the community, as giving back is the right thing to do. Police and Prison Civil Rights Union shop steward Malose Seanego thanked the Habesha Community and praised police patrollers. Patrol co-ordinator Ndo Msimanga praised the Habesha Community for their generosity. “We didn’t expect it. We have a good relationship with them,” said Ndo. Tshwane district police commissioner Major-General Thomas Mthombeni said: “The Habesha Community’s donation of food parcels to patrollers and volunteer social workers is a selfless act of generosity.”
