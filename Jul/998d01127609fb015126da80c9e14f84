The eight-month-old Bonteheuwel girl who was raped is back
home and recovering after being treated at hospital, local councillor Angus
McKenzie said on Wednesday. "She's home. She's recovering," said McKenzie of
the attack which shocked residents in the suburb east of Cape Town. In the meantime, the girl's distraught mother is desperately
trying to get to the bottom of what happened, as the police investigation
continues. McKenzie said social workers had stepped in, and the single
mum was getting support. He said the girl's mother did not want to be interviewed,
but he was told that the she had dropped her baby off with a carer and had gone
to work. When she got back home, she noticed that something was wrong
while changing her baby's nappy. She took her child to the Red Cross Children's hospital
where she was initially treated and the child was later transferred to another
hospital for DNA testing. McKenzie said the matter was being handled "at the
highest level". "It is a very, very sad situation," said McKenzie. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eight-month-old-cape-town-baby-back-home-from-hospital-after-rape-20190703
