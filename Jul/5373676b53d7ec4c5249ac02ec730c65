PITSO Mosimane has refused to be drawn on the weekend reports that he could be on his way out of Mamelodi Sundowns. The four-time Absa Premiership winner is said to be considering quitting the Tshwane giants due to deepening tensions in his relationship with the club, as reported by Sunday World. According to the report, Mosimane is not happy that the club is bringing in a technical director from European… to “police” him. But when quizzed on the allegations, Mosimane poured cold water on the report, explaining: “If I was resigning from Sundowns, then I wouldn’t be sitting here (press conference). I’m not resigning, that’s why I am honouring this press conference, okay? “I’m happy at Sundowns, I’m happy to coach at Sundowns. I want to win the league. I want to give Sundowns the 10th title. I am committed to that. I’m at Sundowns because I want to be at Sundowns. I’m not at Sundowns because of money. If I want more money, I can get it and I have refused it. I’m honouring my contract with Sundowns.” “But if you want to ask more about why, who, where, then go to Sundowns. Sundowns must answer that. My job is to answer to what happens on the pitch. I’m employed for the results, not the politics or other things. I might be affected, I might not be affected. But go to Sundowns.”
