THE volume of traffic increased on the N3 Mariannhill toll plaza yesterday as revellers returned from the Durban July. The event attracted thousands of tourists from Gauteng, Free State and other provinces. The national and provincial traffic cops had a very busy weekend conducting road safety operations. Yesterday, about 1 900 cars passed through Mariannhill toll plaza every hour. Speaking at the toll plaza, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula said they started the #LiveBeyondJuly operation on Thursday to ensure the rules of the road were respected. Road Traffic Management CEO Makhosini Msibi said on Friday they arrested 48 people for driving under the influence. Taxi driver Mbonise Sosibo (42) was driving from Durban to Matatiele, Eastern Cape, when he was pulled over during the operation. “Drivers shouldn’t drink and drive. They risk the lives of those on the road,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “On Saturday, six suspects were arrested for cellphone theft and one was for possession of a fraudulent accreditation. The suspects, aged between 20 and 47, will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court,” she said.
