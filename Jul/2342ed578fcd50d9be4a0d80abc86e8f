ZAMA zamas from Matholesville in Roodepoort said they would keep coming back. This is despite police and city officials confiscating their tools and destroying their structures. Police wiped out the area last week during Operation O Kae Molao, specifically aimed at deal with illegal mining. But local zama zamas said no operation would get in their way of making a living. Zama zamas, who are mostly illegal immigrants, told Daily Sun they came to Mzansi for better opportunities. Melu Makamu (24) from Mozambique said they knew illegal mining was wrong, but it kept them busy and away from criminal activities. “If we were not working here, most of us would be stealing and committing other crimes to get money,” he said. When asked about the damage of infrastructure, allegedly caused by illegal mining activities, Makamu said they were not to be blamed. He claimed the damage was there before they started mining in the area. Another zama zama said he came here last year from Zimbabwe. “I couldn’t find a job, that’s why I went into illegal mining,” he said. He agreed with Makumu that illegal mining kept them away from other crimes. “We are working here, not hurting anyone,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said they would continue with similar operations in the area.
