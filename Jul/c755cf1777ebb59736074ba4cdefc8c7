BIDVEST Wits have revealed that their star Bafana Bafana defender Sifiso Hlanti will be out for a lengthy period. Wits coach Gavin Hunt today (Friday) revealed in a press conference where the club was revealing their new signings for the upcoming campaign. By the look of things the defender could be out for the rest of the 2019-20 Absa Premiership first round as he will go for a knee operation. Hlanti sustained a knee injury when Bafana were defeated 2-1 by Nigeria in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations which recently came to an end in Egypt. The 29-year-old Hlanti won hearts of many South African fans during the 2019 Africa Cup 
of Nations against the host nation Egypt when he kept Liverpool's Mo 
Salah at Bay. Hunt said: "Hlanti is going to be out for sometime. He came back from the national team with a major major injury, I'm very disappointed. He will be out for a long time. "I really don't know the surveillance but I know it 's for a period of time. He won't be available for a long time." Club CEO Jose Ferreira added that Hlanti will go for operation. Ferreira stated: "We will find out later today (Friday) how long he will be out." This is not only Wits' blow as the defender will also miss Bafana Bafana Africa Cup of Nations qualifier matches against Ghana and Sudan in November. Meanwhile Wits announced 10 new signings for the upcoming campaign. The Students unveiled Siyanda Zwane, Brandon Petersen, Carl Lark, Joseph Douhadjie, Phathutshedzo Nange, Kenneth Sebastian, Sameehg Doutie, Prince Nxumalo, Zitha Macheke and Ivan Mahangwahaya.
