FRIENDS, family and neighbours gathered to celebrate Nyanisi Tshabalala’s 100th birthday on Saturday. The gogo from Lebotlwane, North West, said she still sang and prayed every day. Although she can’t read, her grandkids read the Bible to her whenever she can’t make it to church. Her birthday party started with a church service, where pastors praised the gogo for being such a good example to young people. Her grandson Harold Tshabalala said she cooked and did most things for herself until her feet started giving her problems earlier this year. “She has a good memory. She loves people and asks to be visited often,” he said. “She doesn’t like fancy or fried food. She loves meat and sticks to a strict diet, mostly vegetables my aunt grows in the back yard.” Harold said his gogo taught him to respect and love God. “Most of her grandkids don’t drink or smoke because of her teachings,” he said. The gogo had six kids, one of whom has died, 14 grandkids and eight great-grandkids. Gogo Nyanisi said she was born in Ga-Molema, Limpopo, and worked on farms near Modimolle. She said she’d never forget a missionary who preached near a farm where she worked. “The missionary had a school, and on Sunday the classroom would become a church.” She said what she learned at church made her a better person. “My husband drank beer. He’d come home late and fall asleep at the door. I would pick him up without complaining because I learned to forgive.” Nyanisi said God was rewarding her for her faith.
