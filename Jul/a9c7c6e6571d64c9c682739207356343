FORTUNE Makaringe says he took up football because he wanted to play for Orlando Pirates. So, one can understand his excitement now that he has achieved his childhood dream, having joined from Maritzburg United in the off-season. The enterprising midfielder was also courted by Kaizer Chiefs, among others clubs. But... ”As soon as Pirates called, I had to respond. It meant a lot to me to get the call, ” says Makaringe. ”Orlando Pirates doesn't just choose anyone. It's been years since I've been waiting for this move... for years and years. I played football because I wanted to play for Pirates. ”Makaringe could make his Bucs debut in the Carling Cup against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. But his main focus is on helping change the fortunes of the success-starved Buccaneers in the new season. ”I’ll contribute towards that first title. Coming in as Fortune, I believe I’ll changes Bucs’ fortunes. Every new player is expected to help strength the team. I want to be a legend at Bucs and to be a legend I need to win titles. I'm up for the challenge.” Makaringe admits his dad, his first coach, influenced his decision to join the Soweto giants.
