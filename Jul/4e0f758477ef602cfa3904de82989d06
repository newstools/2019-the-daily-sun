A still born baby was found in a rubbish bin by recyclers at a
complex close to the Panorama Sports Field in Roodepoort. Operations manager at BCI Security Rudi Holtzhausen they
were notified about the incident on Saayman Street in Harveston. “Upon investigation we found the gruesome scene of a still
born baby lying on the pavement covered in rubbish,” Holtzhausen said. Holtzhausen said the person who found the foetus was going
through the rubbish bins looking for plastic bottles when he found the baby. “Investigations are underway to determine if the baby was
from a unit inside a complex in the same street where the rubbish bins were
found,” Holtzhausen said. Holtzhausen said they would like to thank the Honeydew
resident and her employee that alerted them to the situation, as well as the
Honeydew SAPS and ER24 staff members.
