COPS, traffic officers and home affairs officials on Friday bust a wanted suspect who had been on the run since March. As part of Operation Sabela, the man suspected of murdering Tshepiso Thompson (16) for his shoes in Kimberley, Northern Cape, was arrested. The suspect was found hiding in a house in Galeshewe. Police spokesman Captain Olebogeng Tawana said the operation targeted hot spots. Tawana told Daily Sun: “Road blocks were set up on the N8 leading to Kimberley and Bloemfontein and on the N12 between Kimberley and Warrenton. “Motorists were issued with fines worth more than R15 000 for contravention of the Road Traffic Act, driving without licences and driving unroadworthy vehicles.” He said three suspects aged between 16 and 24 were bust at a road block after they were found in possession of copper weighing 46,43kg. Three suspects were also arrested in Jan Kempdorp for dealing in drugs when they were found with more than 100 Mandrax tablets. Tawana said all suspects were due in court soon.
