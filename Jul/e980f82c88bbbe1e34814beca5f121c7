THEY say crime does not pay, but an evil thug paid with his life on Monday. He fell out of a getaway car in KwaNoxolo kasi, Port Elizabeth. The thug and his friends had apparently just robbed the home of a gogo who sold hot chips. Residents heard the gogo screaming, and neighbouring women apparently came to her rescue. A woman (32) told Daily Sun: “We’re gatvol of these thugs.  There were five of them in a black VW Polo. Four of them got in the car while one got into the boot. “But he fell out as the vehicle sped off.” A gogo (65) who saw the thug’s lifeless body said: “My nephew (13) is in ICU in hospital after being shot. “He was caught in the crossfire during a shooting on his way to a spaza shop to buy biscuits.” Captain Johan Rheeder said: “A case of murder is being investigated. No one has been arrested yet.”
