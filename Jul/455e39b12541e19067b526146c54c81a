HE was waiting for his kota when he witnessed a cold-blooded murder. “I don’t think I’ll be able to eat kota after witnessing something like this,” he said. The witness told Daily Sun that at around 7pm on Thursday, about seven men entered a food shop in Pimville, Soweto, and demanded cash. “They told the customers to shut up if they didn’t want to get hurt. They told us they weren’t there for us,” he said. “Then they shot the shop owner in the foot.” He said the owner’s son tried to run away but the robbers shot at him several times. The victim died instantly. He said he and other customers then heard a commotion in the shop next door, followed by a gunshot. “Then they drove off in their taxi and I heard a woman scream,” he said. A woman who was watching from across the road said the attackers were from the hostel. “They are taking over our kasi. People are afraid of going to taverns,” she said. “Klipspruit is the same. Every day, we hear gunshots coming from there.” Police spokesman Captain Hitler Ngwenya confirmed there was a shooting in Pimville zone 1. “We can confirm a group of eight men are wanted for murder, attempted murder and business robbery. Three people were shot. “Two died and one is in hospital for treatment. We’re appealing to the public to help trace the suspects,” he said.
