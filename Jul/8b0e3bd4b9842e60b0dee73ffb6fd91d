Four police officers and a security guard were arrested in
connection with the kidnapping of two people on Inanda Road in Springfield,
KwaZulu-Natal police said on Thursday. The incident happened on Wednesday at 22:30, police
spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said in a statement. Gwala said the two victims - aged 28 and 36 - were held at
gunpoint and forced into the boot of a vehicle. The victims were taken to a truck yard on Peters Road where
the accused allegedly demanded an amount of R50 000. "They were severely assaulted after they failed to
produce the money. One of the victims was released and instructed to raise the
cash. The victim who was released contacted the police, who immediately
responded. "The victim pointed out the suspects to police who
prevented them from making good on an attempt to flee." Gwala said police found that the suspects - aged between 19
and 29 - were three policemen and a policewoman stationed at Inanda SAPS. The
fifth suspect appeared to be a security guard, she said. Officers found three state-issued firearms on the suspects. "The complainant's cellphone was also found in their
possession. A state vehicle that was used in the commission of the crime was
found parked at a service station, while another vehicle used by the suspects
was also seized for further investigation." The accused are expected to appear in the Durban
Magistrate's Court on charges of kidnapping, extortion, pointing of a firearm,
theft of a cellphone, and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. "This arrest serves as warning to those who are
engaging in criminal activities and hiding behind the SAPS badge, that their
time is near. "Disciplinary investigations will be initiated to
investigate the conduct of the suspects and they can be dismissed from the SAPS
before the criminal investigations are finalised."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/four-kzn-cops-security-guard-arrested-for-kidnapping-assault-20190725
