THE MAN accused of killing his girlfriend will remain behind bars. His bail application was postponed to 3 September when he appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court yesterday. Kevin Ndlovu (21) from Agincourt Village, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, wasn’t asked to plead on the murder charge. Ndlovu was bust last month after confessing to his mum that he killed Nokulunga Mbatha (22) from KZN, his girlfriend at the time, and buried the body behind his mum’s house. During his previous appearance, the court heard he allegedly assaulted her after accusing her of cheating. Yesterday, the court heard his Legal Aid lawyer Eric Mashele intended to drop his bail application due to lack of evidence to proceed. The state pleaded with the court to work with cops to speed up finalisation of DNA results. Mashele said they decided against applying for bail so cops could finish the investigation.
