GATVOL residents of Enteke in Tafelkop, Durban, took to the streets yesterday. They were demanding better service delivery. The protesters also went to four schools around the area and forced pupils out of the classrooms. They said Councillor Mbuyiseni Mkhize was not helping them receive proper services. Thabani Thabethe (49) told Daily Sun: “We don’t have tar roads and we have a serious problem with our water supply. “It’s often cut off. The municipality must send water trucks.” Mkhize said he was aware of the protest. “Residents should come to my office and not block the roads. The water issue is known and I make sure water trucks come to the area. The roads are going to be fixed soon,” he said. Mkhize said he would not address the protesters because he didn’t understand why they couldn’t come to his office. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “We appeal to residents not to disturb pupils during protests. One day wasted at school can delay the syllabus.”
