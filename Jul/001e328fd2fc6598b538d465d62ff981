THE rebuilding process ahead of the 2019-20 season continues for Kaizer Chiefs as they look to return to their glory days. The Soweto giants have beefed up their attack with the signing of Serbian striker Samir Nurkovic. The 27-year-old joins the Glamour Boys on a three-year contract. He recently played for KFC Komarno, where he had an impressive 2018/19 season. Samir will wear jersey number 9 previously worn by Venezuelan forward Gustavo Paez. Paez was one of the eight casualties to have been released by the club following their poor 2017-19 campaign which saw them finish outside the top 8. Samir joins fellow new signings Lazalous Kambole and James Kotei who joined from Zesco United and Simba SC respectively. Amakhosi are not done yet with their signings as they have also reached an agreement with Melbourne City in Australia for the acquisition of midfielder Kearyn Baccus. Baccus is expected to be announced sometime this week.
