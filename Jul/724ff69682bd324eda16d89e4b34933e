A TAXI driver escaped with his life after giving a hitchhiker a lift on Sunday. The man stopped the taximan as he was driving towards Virginia, but he pulled out a gun and ordered him to drive to Welkom instead. While they were driving, the brave driver grabbed the gun and they started fighting while the Toyota Quantum was moving. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana said: “A 25-year-old suspect has been arrested and charged with attempted robbery. “A taxi driver was driving a Toyota Quantum from Hennenman to Virginia when he gave a hitchhiker a lift.” The driver had said the man threatened him with a gun and told him to drive to Welkom. “When the man started ripping open the dashboard looking for a tracker, the driver grabbed him and they fought over the firearm,” he said. The vehicle went off the road and ended up next to a fence. “The driver and the suspect continued to fight outside the vehicle when a tactical response team vehicle came to the scene. The suspect fled towards the veld but was caught. “The suspect will appear in court soon,” Khosana said.
