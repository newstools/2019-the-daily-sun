SIX women who belong to the co-operative Hitirha hi Vukheta have reached a milestone in growing and harvesting macadamia trees and nuts. Chairwoman Jeaneth Ngobeni (72) said: “We are full of praise and thank the agriculture department for the support given to us.” She said they sold their produce to a local macadamia farm for a reasonable price. “Our customers are mostly men, who say the nuts help them to improve their sex drive.” Jeaneth said they have planted 200 trees on 20 hectares of land next to the R40 at Greenvalley, outside Acornhoek. “We decided to expand after our request was approved by local chiefs. “It was not possible to expand it at Mkhululine because the project is now surrounded by homesteads.” Acting agriculture department head Lucky Monareng said: “We chose to adopt the project.” He said the district gave the co-operative a tractor. “The project has a bankable business plan which was created by district economics officials. “The district is proud of this initiative from a group of women who stop at nothing to make their dreams work and make sure they do not let their families go to sleep on empty stomachs,” Monareng said.
