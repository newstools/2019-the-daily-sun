The Anti-Gang Unit (AGU) arrested at least 16 people suspected
of serious and violent crimes within 48 hours in the Nelson Mandela Bay area,
Eastern Cape police said on Sunday. The unit, together with Metro Police, focused on Motherwell,
Uitenhage, Humandorp and Mount Road at the weekend. Arrests were made for charges of murder, attempted murder,
rape, house robbery, housebreaking, illegal possession of a firearm and
ammunition, assault on police, and damage to property, said Colonel Priscilla
Naidu. She said people were also arrested on drug-related charges. A 9mm pistol, ammunition and a gas gun were seized. In the early hours of Saturday morning, AGU members received
information about a firearm at a house in Zwide. "On arrival at the house, members spotted a group of
males sitting around a fire. As they approached, one male got up and ran,"
said Naidu. "Police ran after him and when they were at the back of
a house, the suspect, aged 32 years old pointed a firearm at the police
officer. The officer fired one shot injuring him in his abdomen." The man was arrested. Provincial police commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga,
warned that there was no place for people to conduct criminal activities. "We are squeezing their spaces and the results are
evident that we are serious in cleaning up these areas. We are and will
continue to break the backbone of the gang environment until all people in
these areas are and feel safe."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anti-gang-unit-squeezes-16-suspects-out-of-nelson-mandela-bay-20190728
