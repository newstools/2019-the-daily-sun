MILLIONS of people around the country live in rented houses and back rooms. But some mastandis make life difficult for tenants. Portia Monyai (30) from Senaoane, Soweto, said she hadn’t been able to live in one place for more than three months. She claimed landlords gave her a difficult time. “I was surprised when at one place I was told sweeping the yard and cleaning the toilet would be my duty. “No one told me about this when I went to enquire about a place to rent. Life in a back room isn’t easy.” She said she had also heard about landlords renting out rooms with no ceiling, tiles or plugs, and telling tenants it was their responsibility to fix these things. Another tenant, Sihle Nxumalo (29), said she was kicked out because the landlord couldn’t understand why she was dropped off by different cars. When she explained that she used metered taxis, the landlord said she felt as if Sihle was degrading her house. But mastandi Nomalungelo Baloyi from Rockville, Soweto, said most tenants don’t pay rent on time. “I also don’t accept people with kids because they make noise and break stuff. I once had a tenant who lost a key. Instead of asking for a spare key, she broke the lock.”
