Two
KwaZulu-Natal school security guards were brutally murdered and another was
critically injured when attackers used a crowbar to butcher them in
Hammarsdale, outside Durban. "They
were pushed into a classroom where they were butchered. Two security guards
succumbed to their wounds and the other was taken to hospital," MEC Kwazi
Mshengu said. The
MEC was speaking at Ukusa High School, where the attack occurred. Police
spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said they were attacked on
Wednesday evening and were forced to open a storeroom. "When
they told the attackers that the keys are not with them, they were forced into
a classroom where they were fatally assaulted." He
said police found the guards, aged 30 and 48, with wounds to their heads. A
crowbar was found next to them. "They
were both certified dead at the scene." Mshengu
said security has since been heightened at the school and new equipment was
brought in. "There
is new equipment, including computers and laptops that were just delivered. I
think the management of the school decided to strengthen security so they are
protected." He
added: "They (the attackers) are so heartless because they take the lives
of others as long as they get what they want." Mshengu
said the discovery was only made on Thursday morning, when the principal
arrived at school. "The
principal arrived and saw the gate locked. The guard coming for [the] day shift
was waiting at the gate. They [hopped over] the gate and discovered the
gruesome killing of the two and the other [one] who was still alive." He
said he would speak to Minister of Police Bheki Cele about the increase in
crime at schools. In
June, 48-year-old teacher Sboniso Nyawose was shot dead at Masuku Primary
School in Folweni. A
man was alleged to have entered the school premises and fired multiple shots at
Nyawose, while he was walking down a passage. He was hit in the head and
abdomen. SOURCE:
