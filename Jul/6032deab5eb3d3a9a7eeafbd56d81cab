AFTER it took Fuzeka Ntshinga years to get an ID, it seems her kids might go down the same path. All of Fuzeka’s five children grew up without birth certificates – Simthembile (22) and Sinazo Ntshinga (19) can’t get IDs. Fuzeka from Freedom Park, near Eldorado Park in Joburg, said: “We’ve been sent from pillar to post by Home Affairs since 2017. “It’s so sad my kids have to go through what I experienced.” Fuzeka had been going to Home Affairs since 1993, trying to get her ID. It was only in 2017 that was she was called to Eastern Cape to fetch her ID. Sinazo said: “We thought the misery of not having IDs was over when our mum got the call to collect her ID.” Fuzeka took all her children to Home Affairs in Orlando West, Soweto, to apply for birth certificates in December 2017. They all got birth certificates the next year and applied for IDs. But Simthembile and Sinazo didn’t receive SMSes to fetch their IDs. “We went to check but they told us to wait for another six months. We waited but nothing happened,” said Sinazo. She can’t find a job to feed her three-year-old. “My daughter doesn’t have a birth certificate and I can’t support her because I’m not working.” She almost failed matric last year due to stress caused by not having an ID. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said their problem was being investigated.
