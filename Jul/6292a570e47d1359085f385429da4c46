 RESULTS of the investigation into what killed 1200 cows in Breeder Farm in Dundee in the KZN midlands could be released early next week. This was revealed by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) Farm Animal Protection Unit Manager Grace De Lange. De Lange said they are still investigating following the discovery of dead cows on 5 July. “At the moment we are still trying to get information from the farm in order to conclude our investigation,” she said. She said for now, they don’t want to comment further on the incident since the matter is still under investigation. “Please check me on Monday maybe the investigation will be completed,” said De Lange. Ward Councillor, Sbonokuhle Zwane confirmed that the local leadership is aware of the incident. Zwane added that they are not sure what real happened, but they suspect that during the mixing of the cow’s food something poisonous was accidentally added. He said the cows belonged to a local farmer who asked not to make any comments to the media about the incident. He said among the 1200 cows that died, some were killed by the farmer after he saw that they were already sick. He said residents are benefiting a lot from the farm as there are several activities that took place within the farm. “Among the activities that are taking place within the farm includes local co-operatives that plant maize in some hectares of the farm which is later being processed into maize meal. Residents also buy raw meat from a butchery which is located within the farm. The owner also sells livestock like cows, sheep and pigs,” said Zwane. He said the tragedy has not affected residents that much as all the activities that are taking place within the farm including the butchery and the selling of cows still happen normally.
