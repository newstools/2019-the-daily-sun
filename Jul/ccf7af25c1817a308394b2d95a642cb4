 HIGHLANDS Park new signing Thela Ngobeni has explained why he did not end up moving to Kaizer Chiefs after he was linked with the club in January. Ngobeni was at the Highlands Park awards ceremony on Tuesday night where the club revealed him as one of their six new signings. Talking at the event Ngobeni reveals his agent was approached by Chiefs but that the offer was not for a long enough period of time to convince him. He told reporters: “So basically, what happened with Chiefs is that there was communication from my agent at the time and we waited for a concrete offer,” “I think we told them what we want, and I think the challenge at some point was the years they wanted to give me. It just didn’t really make sense for me to be there at the times.” The 30-year-old says that contrary to popular belief he was not put off by the fact that he would have been understudy to Itumeleng Khune “Honestly speaking it wasn’t a factor," Ngobeni said. "I don’t remember myself at some point think who is the number one and who is not the number one wherever I go. “What was more important for me was to be in an environment where I’d be happy. Even here at Highlands they have good quality goalkeepers and it won’t be easy for me. “For me it was about being in the best environment.”
