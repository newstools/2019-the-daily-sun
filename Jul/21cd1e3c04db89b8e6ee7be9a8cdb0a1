UKHOZI FM DJ Mafresh was left in shock after he was hijacked. The bubbly DJ, whose real name is Thokozani Mpungose, was on his way to work on Tuesday night when thugs took his Corsa Bakkie. Cellphones, a laptop and other belongings were also taken during the incident. When the SunTeam called him yesterday, he was not available. A colleague said the incident happened at South Gate in Phoenix, Durban. He said Mafresh was in a bad state. “He used his car to run his businesses. I don’t know most of the details because it’s difficult to speak to him at the moment, as he’s still traumatised,” said the colleague. Some of Mafresh’s colleagues asked for listeners to help find the car. The talented DJ joined Ukhozi last year after he was recruited from community station Izwi LoMzansi. He hosts the Akulalwa show between 11am and 2pm on weekdays. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident. “A hijacking case was opened at Phoenix police station,” she said.
