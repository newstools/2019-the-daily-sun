MPUMALANGA’S health department has launched an internal investigation after a nurse was bust on Tuesday. The Hawks arrested Martin Mlotshwa (57) at Sead Clinic in Mzinoni, Bethal, after he allegedly asked a patient to pay R1 000 for termination of pregnancy even though the service is free. The patient reported the matter to the cops, who then set a trap. The Hawks pounced as the patient returned to the clinic with marked bank notes and was offered help. Health MEC Sasekani Manzini called for serious action to be taken. “I’m very disappointed. Our mandate is to serve people with health services at no cost. We don’t have a policy of people paying for pregnancy termination. “ This is unacceptable and action must be taken if he is found guilty,” Manzini said. She urged people to report any suspicious action by health professionals. “People should speak out about misconduct by our workers so we can stop bad habits,” she said. Mlotshwa appeared in Bethal Magistrates Court on Wednesday and was released on R500 bail. He was not asked to plead and the case was postponed to 19 July.
