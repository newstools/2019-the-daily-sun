COPS praised residents who tipped them off on Thursday about stolen copper wire. Khayelitsha cop spokesman Lowellan West said that, while patrolling the Thembani area, they were told a group of men were stripping copper wire in a yard. “They searched the premises and found a few men in the back yard stripping rubber off the wire,” West said. He said when the suspects saw the police they ran away. “Police gave chase and all the suspects were caught.” A case of possession of stolen property was opened. West said the tip-off showed there was a good working relationship between police and residents. “We’re grateful residents are starting to see we can bring a lot of change in our communities if we work together,” he said. West appealed to people to continue informing the police of any suspicious activity in their areas. A resident said they were willing to work with police as long as their names weren’t mentioned. “There’s a lot of criminal activity in our area, and we don’t report it because we don’t trust cops,” said the resident.
