DA Leader Mmusi Maimane has briefed the media following public protector findings against President Cyril Ramaphosa. Earlier on Friday, Mkhwebane found that Ramaphosa misled parliament. BUSI: CYRIL MISLED PARLY! Maimane says he is satisfied by the extent of public protector investigation. He requests that an ad hoc committee be established in parliament to interrogate the appropriate sanction for a president who misleads parliament Maimane said the reason we laid the complaint was that “we felt it crucial that no individual should be above the law. “The finding that the president has deliberately misled parliament is a serious charge …that charge is not only a violation of the executive ethics Acts but is also in violation of powers and privileges ACT.. “Now it is common course that the president is not a member of parliament therefore I want to direct and request that along with other remedial actions that the public protector has already been established, we want to request that an AD Hoc committee be established in parliament,” he said. Maimane said the committee will interrogate what are appropriate sanctions is for a president that mislead parliament. “As I wrote the complaint, I asked the fundamental question that if this was a direct donation, then why it had to go through multiple accounts before in ended up where it ended. “It did raise questions and suspicions of money laundering therefore we accept the remedial actions as proposed by the public protector that the NPA should investigate this matter,” said Maimane. Maimane added that the NPA must respond to a criminal case in this regard.
