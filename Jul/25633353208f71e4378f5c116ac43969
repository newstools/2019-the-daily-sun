WALKING 5km to school is a thing of the past for pupils of Shobiyana Secondary School, in Acornhoek, near Bushbuckridge. It’s all thanks to the donation made by Mpumalanga Roads and Transport MEC Gillion Mashego on Tuesday. Mashego said they would still donate over 1 000 bicycles to rural pupils who do not qualify for scholar transport due to them travelling less than 5km to school. Mashego told the pupils: “It’s a blessed day as we are celebrating our hero, Tata Madiba this month,” he said. “Today we are here to hand over 12 bicycles to pupils who walk almost 5km to school. “The journey of leadership begins here. We have followed the criteria and I am convinced we have allocated the bikes to deserving pupils. “Our trained officials will help with servicing them, so look after them because if they’re not managed properly, they can be dangerous. “Use the bikes only to come to school and go back home,” he said. Mashego urged pupils to take their education seriously, as they are the future. He said the idea was to ensure punctuality. “Two of the national top 10 matric pupils must come from here next January,” he said. Excited grade 8 pupil Thandazile Siwelane (13) said she used to walk 3km from Greenvalley to school and was thankful for the special gift. Principal Judy Mbokota was over the moon about the department’s donation.
