IT has come to SunSport’s attention that Moroka Swallows have successfully bought the status of NFD side Maccabi. Even though club official, Panyaza Lesufi, Gauteng MEC for Education, could not be found for confirmation last night, but our sources have confirmed that the deal is done. Lesufi has promised that the DubeBirds will be back in the mainstream next season, and he has even gone as far as announcing their new sponsors via social media last week. According to our source, the negotiations to buy Maccabi have been going on since June this year, and they have apparently agreed on an R18 million price. “Swallows will be playing in the NFD next season. Panyaza and his business partners bought Maccabi and it will continue playing as Swallows FC,” said our mole. “They will use the Dobsonville Stadium in Soweto as their home ground. The players have been told that there is a new owner and the business partners will made public before end of this week. “Everyone is happy to see Swallows back in a professional league and they will be one step to away from the PSL.” It was rumoured earlier in the year that Lesufi was looking at purchasing the status of financially challenged Bloemfontein Celtic, but the deal failed to materialise because Free Staters will not allow Phunya Sele Sele out of their province. Swallows were relegated from the PSL in the 2014-15 season under then CEO Leon Prins. They further dropped to the lower leagues where they are at this stage. When contacted for comment, Maccabi owner Allan Norman said “It is late, I can’t comment”.
