BUSINESS used to be good – but now it has become really bad. Street vendors at the KwaMashu Shopping Centre, north of Durban, said stinking sewage water was running through the centre next to their stock and it was killing their businesses. Nonhlanhla Mkhize (45), a vendor who sold mielies, said they reported the problem to the eThekwini Municipality but nothing happened. “Nobody is buying my mealies,” she said. “There is a burst sewerage pipe inside the centre and the stinking water runs close to our stalls.” Vendor Thabiso Ndlela (48), who ran a barber shop, said customers were no longer coming to cut their hair. “This was reported to the municipality but they haven’t done anything yet. Our businesses are suffering. We are appealing to the municipality to attend to it before we go out of business,” he said. “I had to put bricks down to avoid walking in the dirty water.” A shopper said she suspected there was something wrong with the pipes at the centre because there were often problems. “I came to buy some mealies but I didn’t because of the smell. I’m worried they have bacteria in them,” she said. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said engineers were sent to investigate the matter.
