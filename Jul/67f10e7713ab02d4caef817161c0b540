PHEW! Breaking news, South Africans are smiling AGAIN. Following months and weeks of torture and frustrations, the netball Proteas have finally found a way to make the country, south of the African continent, to recover their confidence and feel proud of themselves. The Bafana Bafana heartache, cricket Proteas' embarrassment and many other national football teams failures have left Mzansi with a bitter taste in the mouth. The netball Proteas' narrow 55-52 Netball World Cup win against the number two ranked Jamaica in Liverpool, was just the tonic everyone wanted. Jubilant Spar Proteas head coach Norma Plummer admits that she knew the game against the Jamaicans would be an intense game. "We were expecting (it) on that court," Plummer said, "and we got exactly that." "I think the girls did very well and stepped up," she recalls about their third straight win at the World Cup. They started the tournament by running riot against Trinidad & Tobago (76-45); Fiji (90-35) be they shocked Jamaica. "We committed some mistakes which we will work on when we regroup as a team. I am happy with a win against Jamaica, this is a great moral booster for the team as we go onto the next round,” said Plummer. They are expected to carry on with their winning form on Monday when they face the stubborn Scotland at the M&S Bank Arena (Court Two) at 5.25pm. The Proteas were moved to Group G alongside top achievers in the second preliminary round England, Jamaica, Uganda, Scotland and Trinidad and Tobago. The top two teams in the group will proceed into the play-off matches and the others play the same position from Group F in a placement match.
