A KwaZulu-Natal family spent two weeks trying to drive two black 
mambas out of hiding in the back room of their Inanda home this month. Local snake catcher Nick Evans faced an unusual challenge on Thursday as he dug through the messy room to catch the snakes. He told News24 the room was a suitable place to hide. It was warm and was home to rodents the mambas could feed on. "My main focus was just to locate them without standing too close to where they were." Evans was able to retrieve a 2.3 metre female and 1.9 metre male. "The male was quite small compared to the female and had a portion of its tail missing." When he arrived, the homeowners were burning tyres to drive out the snakes. Evans explained burning tyres to scare away snakes was an ineffective old wive's tale because mambas generally hid underground. Despite
 the smoke, Evans managed to retrieve both reptiles. In the process, he 
discovered the small space had also been infested with whip scorpions. Footage recorded on Evan's GoPro device showed the small insects running along the walls as he caught the first snake. But Evans said the harmless scorpions were not a threat.  Evans,Â owner of KZN Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, has caught 21 black mambas since May. "We
 will see these kinds of sightings die down now that mating season is 
almost over, but other reptiles such as cobras, for example, start 
coming out." He said that it was important that people who find black mambas were not afraid. "Generally they just look for places to hide. If you leave it alone, it will leave you alone."
