GOGO Matseloane Kubedu heard screams in her sleep but didn’t realise the nightmare was real. There was a fire in her shack when the 63-year-old woke up. Her husband of 15 years burned to death in the fire that was caused by a heater in their shack in Weilers Farm, south of Joburg, on Wednesday night. Mulaudzi Matseloane said her husband Samson (66) usually switched off the heater before going to bed, but this time he forgot. She said they started sleeping in separate rooms after thugs broke into their shack last year. “We decided to guard our rooms. We didn’t want to make things easy for the criminals.” Gogo Matseloane said her grandson (9) usually slept with Samson, but on Wednesday he slept with her. “I can’t even begin to imagine what could have happened,” she said. The couple’s daughter Mabolae Molefi (30) was still in shock when the SunTeam spoke to her. “As much as I’m sad that my dad died, I’m grateful that my son survived.” Robert Muladzi, a spokesman for Joburg Emergency Medical Services, told Daily Sun: “People must switch off all heating devices before going to bed, and those using mbawula must take them outside before going to bed to avoid carbon monoxide inhalation.”
