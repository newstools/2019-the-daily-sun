TIMOTHY Mongale is worried his beloved uncle might die in prison. The 23-year-old man from Stinkwater in Tshwane said his uncle Clifford Motolo (33), was refused treatment for cancer at George Mkhari Hospital. Timothy said his uncle is suffering from liver cancer. Clifford started serving a three-year sentence at Odi Prison in Mabopane, Tshwane, in 2016 for house robbery. “During my visit to him in March, he told me he was suffering from cancer,” said Timothy. The uncle told him he was allegedly only given painkillers, which didn’t help ease the pain. “He told me he relied on medication from other prisoners who also suffer from cancer. He has lost a lot of weight. My fear is he might not be taking the right medication. “I know he’s in jail for doing wrong but I can’t fold my hands while he’s being denied his rights.” He said he dreaded the possibility of his uncle dying in custody. “All I want is for him to get medication or be taken to hospital,” he said. Gauteng correctional services spokeswoman Zandile Mabunda said the department was aware the inmate was ill. However, she was unable to talk about the nature of the illness because it was confidential. “According to the offender’s medical records, he is receiving medication and treatment and the allegations are baseless.”
