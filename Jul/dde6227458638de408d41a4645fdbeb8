The popular Maimane Alfred Phiri Games have so far lived up to expectations again this year. For the past 18 years, hoards of football fans have gathered at the Rotary Grounds in Alexandra to get a dose of kasi “diski flavour” being dished out by budding professionals. This year's edition, if anything, has been bigger and better with entertainment galore. The action is only going to intensify as the popular winter kasi tournament moves on to the last 16 stage.
