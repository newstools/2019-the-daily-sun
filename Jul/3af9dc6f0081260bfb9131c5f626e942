CHIPPA United coach Clinton Larsen has confirmed that former Orlando Pirates defender Caio Marcelo is not training with the club as previously reported. Pirates released Marcelo, Diamond Thopola, Phetso Maphanga and Gladwin Shitolo whom they said would be joining Chippa. However, it now appears that Marcelo would rather leave South Africa than play for the Chilli Boys. "No he is not with us. There were talks a couple of week ago, but nothing materialised. No, heâ€™s not with us," Larsen said. -Sport24
