It is with deep sadness that the Maseko family confirms that Mandla Maseko tragically passed away in a bike accident last night, 6 July 2019. Maseko - popularly known as Spaceboy and Afronaut - beat 1 million people to become one of 23 people who won a seat sponsored by the Axe Apollo Space Academy, on an hour-long sub-orbital trip in 2014. Maseko (30), a Soshanguve native, went on to train as a private pilot and became a CPL with the South African National Defence Force. As a public speaker and community worker, Maseko worked to inspire many African children to pursue careers in science. His community work saw him join the Corsa Utility Club Mzansi. An avid biker with the Tshwane Legend Bikers. In 2016 he was honored by the Gauteng Department of Education and had the Science building at the Curtis Nkondo School of Specialisation named after him. Details of his memorial service and funeral will be announced during the course of this week. Maseko will be solely missed. May Mandla Masekoâ€™s kind and beautiful soul Rest In eternal Peace.
