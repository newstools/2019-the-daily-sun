POLICE minister Bheki Cele has indicated that he may have been misled by his police when he announced that Senzo's killers would be arrested before Easter holidays this year. Cele visited Meyiwa's family in Umlazi south of Durban on Tuesday afternoon. Senzo's father Sam Meyiwa died of stroke on Monday. Faced with media questions on why he made promises he couldn't keep about arresting Senzo's killers he said people should remember that he is not an investigator but rely on the information he was  being told by investigators. "Well I gave timelines that were not met and I said what I said because I was brief by my team. I'm not investigating the case myself. I will not give timelines again but after we have found killers I will personally go to uncle Sam's grave and inform him that I have found your son's killers now you can rest in  peace," said Cele. He also announced that the new special team has been assembled to investigate Senzo's case and has spoken to president Cyril Ramaphosa. He also said that even NPA head Shamilla Batohi has been briefed about the case.
