SHE was found with a bag containing guns. And when questioned, she failed to give cops a proper explanation, so she was arrested. The 34-year-old woman from Angelo in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni was found in possession of four assault rifles of different calibres and 344 rounds of unlicensed live ammunition on Friday morning. Constable Justice Ramaube of Boksburg North said the woman claimed the bag contained guns which were left by her friend. Cops are now on the hunt for the “friend.” They believe he’s the mastermind behind a series of robberies in the Boksburg area. “The man is being sought by police for two previous cases of house robbery in the Boksburg North area and Crystal Park,” said Ramaube. “However, the recovered guns and unlicensed ammunition are believed to have been stolen during robberies in the Boksburg North area.” Ramaube said the suspect was nabbed through an intelligence driven operation by members of the Boksburg North trio task team and the Benoni tracing team. Further investigations into the matter continue. “We appeal to the public to help us with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect who’s on the run. Anyone who has information is asked to contact 08600 10111,” said Ramaube.
