THE Mzansi rapper Gigi Lamayne has
collaborated on a song with the Durban club DJ, HappyGal. The two talented artists have been hinting on
their social media platforms that they will be dropping their new song titled Injabulo. However, the track belongs to HappyGal and
Gigi Lamayne is featured on it. It seems like HappyGal only wants to focus on the
positive, as she continues to use her music to brag about how happy she is.
Last year she released a single track Happiness.
