BAFANA Bafana will still receive their R320 000 bonus, each player as promised, despite narrowly qualifying for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation (AFCON) last 16. It was a long twenty-four-hours wait before head coach Stuart Baxter and his charges were able to find out that they advanced to the next round. After winning only one of their three Group D matches, South Africa finished third behind Morocco and Ivory Coast. Namibia ended their tournament with no points in last place. But following Tuesday night’s results Bafana scraped through via the best third-place teams along with Guinea, DR Congo and Benin. South Africa now have the mammoth task of playing tournament favourites and host nation Egypt on Saturday, July 6. Meanwhile, the South Africa Football Association (SAFA) president Danny Jordaan confirmed last week that each Bafana player will receive a R320 000 bonus despite the manner in which they qualify for the next round. "We expect them to go to the second round‚ at least," Jordaan said. "That's why we have a bonus structure‚ to go to the second round. Because it's no use you win one match‚ win this match. "That's when we give them R320‚000 each (getting through the group stage). And if they had gotten the normal win bonuses of R60‚000 (per game)‚ you would get R180‚000 (for three group wins). "But we want to go to the second round. So we double it to go to the second round."
