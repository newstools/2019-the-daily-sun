AMAZULU'S new striker Andre de Jong aims to make the same impact as former club’s striker Emiliano Tade. De Jong was signed by Usuthu from Eastern Suburbs in New Zealand, after netting 17 goals in 20 appearances on their way to being crowned champions. His club succeeded Tade’s former club – Auckland City – in winning the league. Tade, who was born in Argentina, was signed from Auckland at the beginning of last season. He then excelled at AmaZulu in the first half before he joined Mamelodi Sundowns in January. He became the first Usuthu player in history to win the Player of the Month award in November/December along with his then coach, Cavin Johnson, who was simultaneous named Coach of the Month. Said De Jong: “I spoke a lot with Emiliano and we actually played in the same league back in New Zealand, but for different teams,” said De Jong in AmaZulu’s pre-camp in Woodmead in Joburg. “He’s got good football brains. He was lucky enough to come over here and score lots of goals and had a big effect in the team. “Hopefully, having an effect like that will be amazing. Even just to contribute will be good for the team.” However, since de Jong comes from the new league, he’s fully aware that it’ll also take him a bit of time to hit the ground running. He added: “I’d love that to happen . When you come to the new league, obviously it’ll take a bit of time. But the boys and the coaching staff have been really good in settling me in. “I’ll try to contribute and score goals. I scored goals in New Zealand. Hopefully, I can bring some of that form to South Africa.” AmaZulu will get the 2019/20 season underway against Bidvest Wits on 3 August at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi.
