IN THE Bible, Samson kills a lion with his bare hands with powers given to him by God. Two weeks ago, Ten-ten Mokgobu matched Samson in his feat of strength. The 61-year-old from Hananwa Village, outside Bochum in Limpopo, killed a leopard after the beast roared and charged at him from behind a rock. Ten-ten said he came across the animal on a nearby mountain while looking for three missing sheep. “I found them dead. I had just spotted one with blood on its throat when I heard a loud roar,” he said.  “The leopard tried to jump on my head, but I ducked and hit it in the face with a panga. “It was bleeding and fell to the ground. I choked it until it lost its power and then I hit it in the face with the panga again.” Ten-ten told Daily Sun he was released from hospital on Friday with deep injuries to his right hand as the leopard had bitten through some of his veins. He said it took villagers hours to get him to hospital after the attack as he had to be brought down the mountain. Chief Ngoako Malebogo of the Bahananwa Traditional Council said there were many wild animals on the mountain.  He said he believed God and Ten-ten’s ancestors gave him the power to defeat the leopard. Environmental Affairs spokesman Zaid Kalla asked Ten-ten to submit a report on how he was attacked so the matter could be investigated.
