DR REBECCA MALOPE, speaking exclusively to Daily Sun, said she grew up in poverty and hunger with an abusive father. “We were so poor we ate rats to fight hunger,” said the gospel star. “MY FATHER BEAT MY MUM WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH ME.” As a result, Rebecca said, she was born prematurely. She said the truth about her childhood growing up in KaNyamazane, outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga, will be outlined in a new untitled book she’s writing.
