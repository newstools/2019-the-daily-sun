POLICE Minister Bheki Cele is known
for not mincing his words when it comes to thugs. When President Cyril Ramaphosa
appointed him to take charge of crime, there was widespread applause and relief. When he was police commissioner, Cele
instilled fear in criminals with his “shoot to kill” speech. He had been criticised for his
introduction of amaberete and won the hearts of many others for his tough talk. Daily Sun sat down with the
much-loved minister in our first digital installment of Under the Umbrella,
where he opened up about his vision for the department. Cele spoke to us about how he planned
to bring down criminal elements in neighbourhoods.
