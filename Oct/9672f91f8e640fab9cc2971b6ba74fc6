KAGISO Thwala has always been crazy about motorbikes. The Pretoria resident has always been interested in the Kawasaki brand’s Ninja range. And today, he gets around on a 2015 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10R. Said Kagiso: “It’s always been my dream to one day own a Ninja, hence the ZX10R is my ultimate bike.” Q: When did you buy your bike? A: On 14 December. Q: Is it your first? A: No, my second. My first bike was also a Ninja, a 2013 Kawasaki ZX6R 636 special edition. Q: Is anyone else allowed to ride it? A: No, only people who are very close to me can ride my bike. It’s a trust thing. Q: Have you taken her on long distance trips? A: Yes, but not that many yet. My longest trip so far is to Kimberly. Q: Is this your dream bike? A: It’s my dream bike. Q: How often do you ride? A: All the time. Q: When did you start riding? A: I started riding in April 2017 and it was great. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: Hahaha! What are you saying? I don’t get those things because I obey the rules of the road. Q: Do you have a licence for riding? A: Yes. Q: Tell us about your outfit? A: When it’s hot, I wear a ventilated textile riding jacket and a pair of jeans. Riding boots are important because many of my tekkies are worn out because of riding. My helmet is a Shark D-Skwal. Q: Do you belong to a bike club? A: Platinum Expendables MCC.
