KHANYA is looking for love! And he promised to treat the woman who falls in love with him like a queen. But he does not want baby mamas or sugar mamas. Khanya Cekwana told Daily Sun he broke up with his girl in July. “We dated for only two months. Our relationship didn’t go far. “She was playing with my feelings,” said Khanya. He said sugar mamas shouldn’t contact him. He’s not interested.  “There reason I don’t want someone with a kid is that I don’t have kids. “I don’t want baby daddy drama. I want someone I’ll have a child with, not someone who already has a child.” Khanya doesn’t care about size. “I love women of all shapes. She can be slender or chubby. I will love her unconditionally.”  The 26-year-old from Siyahlala squatter camp in Philippi Browns Farm, Cape Town, was born with a disability. He doesn’t mind dating someone living with a disability. “I also have a disability and I’m not fit enough to carry someone. “Women must not stress about my private part. It works just fine.”
