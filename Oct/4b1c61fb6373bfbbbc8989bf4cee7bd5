Chad da Don has moved on from ex-girlfriend Kelly Khumalo with model Carlla Poggenpoel. On Wednesday, Chad shared a photo of his new love interest on Instagram, writing: "Ride or die. No matter what." The pair have also been sharing loved-up photos and videos on their Instagram Stories.  It is unclear when the couple started dating, but on 14 October Chad commented on one of Carlla's Instagram photos: "Was wondering if I could get your number darling? Or do you got a man?"To which she responded: "I do have a man, kinda looks like you actually." Speaking to Channel24, Chad's management team confirmed the romance, saying: Carlla is a lovely and friendly girl. She studies art and supports Chad in all his endeavours. His current relationship does not affect his relationship with Kelly, nor does it affect her relationship with him." Last week Kelly tweeted: "Just saw someone I used to know and heart..... what do I do?"The tweet led many to believe that she ran into her ex-boyfriend, Chad. Earlier this year the pair reportedly got engaged, after getting matching tattoos on their ring fingers, but six months into the relationship called it quits.
