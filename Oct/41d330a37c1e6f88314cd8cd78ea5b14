ANGRY shoppers at Mega City Mall in Umlazi, south of Durban, refuse to pay for public toilets. They called on eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda to take action against the mall. They claimed the mall was charging customers to use the toilets.  The shoppers had been complaining for nearly 10 years about the situation. They became more furious when the price recently went up from R2 to R3. Nelisiwe Dlamini (26) told Daily Sun: “We raised our concerns with the mayor when he was here on Tuesday. “We asked him to talk to the mall management.” Bongani Mkhize (37) from Lamontville said some people were sick and needed to use the toilet more often. Kaunda confirmed he had received a number of complaints. He said he believed it was unfair and he’d talk to mall management soon. Siphumelele Khuzwayo, a general manager at the mall, said the toilet pay user system was introduced after non-shoppers used and vandalised them.
