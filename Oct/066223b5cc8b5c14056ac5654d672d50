SAFA boss Danny Jordaan has reacted to social media posts after Bafana Bafana’s 2-1 win against Mali in their Nelson Mandela Challenge match in Port Elizabeth on Sunday. The excited South Africans have been thirsty of such a victory at home and have even appreciated coach Molefi Ntseki’s debut on the bench, and winning raised a lot of expectation. Some are already having high ambitions about the Bafana side they saw, where Dean Furman and Themba Zwane scored to honour the late former president. “Now you saw the Tweets, they say Molefi Ntseki will win the World Cup – that is South Africans,” Jordaan said. “You win one match then you’re the best in the world, you lose one match the you’re the worst. “South Africans have no middle ground. There is no rationale and they want to be the best, make them feel they are the best.” Jordaan said as he addressed the players after the match, where he tried forcefully to inculcate the winning mentality to the players and build on the confidence. “You can talk about all the other sporting codes, but there is only one national team that the people of this country follow, that is Bafana Bafana,” Jordaan told the players. “You don’t have to teach them to love the team, they love the team, and your performance really expressed it that they appreciate. “You fought hard and (were) determined to win the match. “It was difficult but you stuck to it. You proved it yourselves that you are one of the best teams on the continent.” According Jordaan, players must believe, “it does not matter who comes”. “You can beat Mali, you could beat Egypt. The other teams are lesser of these teams. So you are one of the best. Thanks for the effort...” He, however, cautioned that players must not develop the attitude of being arrogant “because our fans are not arrogant”.
