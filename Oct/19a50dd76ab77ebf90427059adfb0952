THE South African National Taxi Council says the driver demerit system will leave drivers without licences while enriching corrupt cops. Santaco provincial deputy chairman Sifiso Mthethwa said his organisation doubted the system would reduce road deaths. Mthethwa told Daily Sun Santaco raised questions with government on how it would prevent bribes when the system started. He said his organisation thought government would introduce measures to stop bribes while launching the system in Gauteng over the weekend, but it only announced when it would start next year. “We’re not against measures to save lives on our roads, but we don’t think this system will have great impact because rich people will pay bribes to police in order to keep their licences,” said Mthethwa. President Cyril Ramaphosa officially launched the system on Saturday and announced it would start operating in June. Ramaphosa signed the Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Bill into law two months ago. According to the law, a driver is allocated points, which would be deducted each time they violate traffic rules. The driver stands to lose six points for drunk driving, while three points would be deducted for other offences. Six points would also be taken for driving 100km in a 60km zone. Taxi drivers would lose five points for overloading. If a driver has lost 12 points, their licences would be suspended for three months and cancelled after losing all the points three times. Transport and safety liaison MEC Bheki Ntuli said government would deal with cops who take bribes.
