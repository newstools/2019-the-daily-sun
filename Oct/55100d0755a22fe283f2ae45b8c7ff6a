SEASON 12 Idols SA winner Noma Khumalo is turning over a new leaf in her career. There were reports about the singer having depression and her career not doing well. Noma transitioned from being a teacher to superstardom. After winning, she had hoped to inspire not only the youth, but all the people of Mzansi. She cleared the air about the depression reports, saying: “I was never hospitalised and don’t suffer from depression. “This happened many years ago. It’s a closed chapter I don’t wish to revisit. This is my time of silence and finding myself. I need my privacy.” The crooner is working to raise people’s awareness on mental health issues in the entertainment industry.Because most musicians go through unspeakable challenges and they should know that they are not on their own. Speaking to Sunday Sun, Noma said winning the competition had changed her life around. She said she came face-to-face with the realities of the music industry. “Idols SA has taught me not to be fearful and go after what I want. “It’s not all sunshine and rainbow. Your eyes are opened because you get to learn about life behind the scenes and not what’s in the media.” Like any rising star who has recently found popularity, Noma had faced some challenges and one of them was learning how to handle fame. “My wish is that during the competition, at least, one of the sessions should be devoted to financial wellness. “I was young and uninformed about financial spending at the time.” Noma is working on her new Afro-soul album, under Bluewave Music. So far, she’s released two singles, Wensizwe, featuring Mzukulu and Libhaliwe. The two have been getting a lot of airplay.
