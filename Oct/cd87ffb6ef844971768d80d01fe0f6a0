LIFE for Ntswaki Seekane has been a nightmare since she broke her silence about being raped. The 45-year-old Correctional Services monitoring officer from Harrismith, Free State, said she now sleeps with one eye open.  She said she’s been getting death threats from an unknown person. Her house was almost broken into on Friday. Daily Sun published her story, headlined “I bust my rapist boss!”, on 20 August. Ntswaki claimed she was her boss’ sex object before she was allegedly raped. “My life was turned upside down after I broke my silence. I sometimes have to sleep elsewhere as I fear for my life,” said Ntswaki. “I’ve been getting phone calls from an unknown man threatening me. The person tells me, ‘I’m going to show you who you are dealing with, mama’s baby.’ “The phone calls usually come at night when I’m about to sleep. I was alone in my house on Friday when I was woken up by a banging sound on my roof. My windows were also smashed.” Correctional Services spokeswoman Puleng Mokhoane said: “The incident was investigated and the implicated official has applied for a transfer. “The compliant was advised to report the matter of threats to the police.” Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mopiring said an attempted burglary case was opened.
