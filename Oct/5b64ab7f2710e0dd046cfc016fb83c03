JDR Stars owner coach Nditsheni Nemasisi revealed the secret to their early success in the GladAfrica Championship. The newly promoted outfit have taken to life in the second division of Mzansi football like a duck to water. They continued their impressive form with a 3-2 victory over Tshwane rivals University of Pretoria at Giant Stadium on Saturday. This leaves the Hammer Boys, as Stars are affectionately known, perched at the top of the Championship standings with 15 points from seven matches. And according to Nemasisi, keeping the core of the squad that earned them promotion, has been key to the rookies success. “Continuation is important, about 80% of the team has remained the same from last season,” revealed Nemasisi. “We decided to keep the spine of our squad for consistency and just make a few additions where necessary. “We only wanted players who would improve us, and not destabilise what we had been building for the past few years. “A complete overhaul of playing staff would not have served us well because we would have had to start from scratch. “And it takes time to get the new players settled, to find combinations and get that synergy right, as you can see with other teams who have completely changed their squads. “A great deal of planning went into each and every one of our transfers and those plans were aligned to a well thought out strategy.” Stars next face TS Galaxy at Kameelrivier Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm) as they hope to continue to prove that their fine start to the season is no fluke. Nemasisi added that his team were inspired by the Rockets’ fairytale story last season which saw them become the first NFD side to win the Nedbank Cup. “No one gave them (Galaxy) a chance to do that, just like no one is giving us a chance to win the league this season,” added Nemasisi. “It would be such a massive achievement for this team and we believe that we can pull it off.”
