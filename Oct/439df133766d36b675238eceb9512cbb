YES, I did it and I’m guilty. This was the confession from Kgaugelo Maime (30). He’s one of four suspects who petrol-bombed a bus transporting 52 mineworkers to Modikwa Platinum Mine in Driekop Village, Limpopo, in April last year. Maime appeared in the Limpopo High Court yesterday,  facing six counts of murder and 48 of attempted murder. He and three other suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges. Maime later turned state’s witness. He was convicted and sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment for each murder count and 10 years for each attempted murder count. The sentences will run concurrently because he co-operated. The three other suspects will be back in court on 30 April for trial. Judge President Ephraim Makgoba handed down judgment.
