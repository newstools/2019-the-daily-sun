COPS and the community plan to work together in order to wipe out crime. On Saturday, residents of Tarlton on the West Rand met with police to talk about ways of identifying thugs and ending crime. Police bosses, the CPF led by Emmanuel Munyai, Councillor Dikgang Sithole and Matshelapad squatter camp residents attended. Community member Nkosikhona Mazwai (37) said: “We end up taking the law into our own hands because they drag their feet.” He was talking about cops. Phumzile Mkhonza (45) said women withdraw abuse cases. “We bury our sisters in the name of love. Police need to be strict about this,” she said. Tarlton cops spokesman Constable Lucky Matome said police and the community had to relate. “This allows all parties to take a lead and be accountable,” said Matome. Detective branch commander Captain Sam Nkhumane said gender-based violence was top on their list. “The trick is to take action at the first sign of trouble,” said Nkhumane. He said reporting suspicious activities and participating in crime-fighting groups formed part of crime prevention. Matshelapad sector manager Constable Lebo Mogale urged residents to form neighbourhood watch and crime forums. “Take advantage of opportunities presented by the police by applying to become an officer and participating in youth desks,” said Mogale.
