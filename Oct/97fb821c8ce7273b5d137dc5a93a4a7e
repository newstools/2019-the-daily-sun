UNEMPLOYMENT feeds many social ills, including crime. During the festive season everyone’s looking for the good times and will ensure nothing stops them. So the first thing to make sure is safe is yourself when you walk about, but more so is your home where you sleep and live with your loved ones. David Magwane from Diepkloof, Soweto, was once a victim of crime. Today, he has put up security measures to protect himself and his family from would-be criminals. Said David: “I’ve beefed up my home security by installing burglar bars on windows and doors.” Marius Neethling, the underwriting manager at Santam, said South Africans should used simple but effective methods to protect their homes. So, ensure to adhere to the requirements stipulated in your policy.
