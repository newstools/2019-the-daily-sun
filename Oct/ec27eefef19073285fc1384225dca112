RESIDENTS from Ga-Ledwaba Village claim Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha is not taking them seriously. Yesterday, they marched to the premier’s offices to hand over a memorandum of grievances over a chieftainship dispute. But he wasn’t there to receive it. The march followed Mathabatha’s decision to withdraw Priscilla Ledwaba’s chieftainship and hand it to Felix Ledwaba. “The premier was aware we were coming,” march leader Tshepo Lamola said. “But he decided not to make time for us. We wanted him to receive our memorandum. “The march is legal. That’s why there are police and traffic cops escorting us. We wanted to make Mathabatha realise that we were concerned about corruption in the Ndlovu Ledwaba Traditional Council. “When we complain, police are called and they arrest us.” Another protester, John Ledwaba, said he was disappointed that the premier didn’t want to address the community’s problems. “It’s better we go back home because he’s undermining us. We can’t give the memorandum to just anyone as this is our third time coming here,” he said. “Our previous memorandums never received responses, so how can we trust this one will be responded to?” Eddie Manaka, deputy director-general in the office of the premier, told residents Mathabatha was away and had asked him to receive the memorandum on his behalf. “I promise I’ll make sure it lands in the hands of the premier,” he said. But the angry protesters refused to hand the memorandum to him.
