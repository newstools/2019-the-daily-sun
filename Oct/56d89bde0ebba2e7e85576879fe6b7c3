Two people were chopped to death and burned in Sebjeng village in Limpopo. The dead people were allegedly kidnaped by community members from different villages of ga-Molepo, allegedly for stock theft. They then took them to a community hall at Sebjeng gaMolepo where they were severely assaulted. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the victims were thereafter taken to the bushes next to the old Setlakalane High School where they were burned. “A car belonging to one of the deceased was also found torched a few kilometers from the scene,” Mojapelo said. The deceased were identified as Thabana Mokgohloa and Mack Mashapa. Cops are investigating the possibility that a third person might have suffered the same fate. Cases of two counts of murder and kidnapping have been opened for investigation and a manhunt is already underway.
