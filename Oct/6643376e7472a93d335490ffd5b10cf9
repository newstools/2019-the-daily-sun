MMUSI Maimane has formally quit as the leader of the  Democratic Alliance. After four years at the helm of the official opposition,he announced at a much delayed press conference at the party's headquarters in Bruma,east of Joburg,that he was stepping down. Soon after Maimane's farewell speech, DA Federal Chair Athol Trollip also announced his resignation. Incoming DA federal chair Helen Zille spoke last and paid tribute to both Mmusi and Athol. She said she and Mmusi had argued in the past but that it never diminished her respect for him. The party was turned upside down over the weekend when Helen Zille staged a massive comeback when she was elected as the party's new federal chair. On Monday morning Herman Mashaba resigned as DA mayor of Joburg and as a DA councillor. Addressing the media, Mashaba said the re-election of Helen represents victory for people in the DA who stand opposed to the his believes and value system. “I cannot reconcile myself with a group of people who believe that race is irrelevant in the discussion of inequality and poverty in South Africa in 2019,”Mashaba said.
