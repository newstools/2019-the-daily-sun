THABO Sobeya’s dad Albert had a marble eye, and Thabo adored it. That’s why he was saddened when his dear father took his last breath without it! Thabo from Winterveld, north of Tshwane, said the marble eye went missing in April when his dad was admitted to Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital. He said: “My father had a problem with his toe and it affected his leg. “We took him to hospital and they couldn’t help him. Instead they cut off his leg. “Doctors didn’t only take his leg. They also took his marble eye.” Thabo blamed the hospital and wanted to know what happened to the marble eye. “When we asked the hospital about the eye, staff only told me they were sorry,” he said. Thabo said he lodged a complaint after his father’s funeral. “My family needs to know what happened to my father’s eye so we can find closure and peace,” he told the People’s Paper. Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital spokesman Zwide Ndwandwe confirmed to Daily Sun that Thabo lodged a complaint with the hospital’s quality assurance unit. “The unit said it had a redress session with him, and it tried in vain to find the marble eye,” said Ndwandwe. They suspected the eye got lost when the patient was being transferred from one ward to another.
