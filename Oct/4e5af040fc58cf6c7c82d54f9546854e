MAGDALENE Jika had struggled since June to get her Sassa card back from a mashonisa. But after Daily Sun published her story last week, cops went to the loan shark with the gogo to get her Sassa card and ID back! The 63-year-old from Mmamahabane near Ventersburg, Free State, said she owed the mashonisa R1 500. But the woman kept withdrawing money from her Sassa card, even after she had paid back R2 550. “We were suffering from hunger until Daily Sun intervened. The police failed to help me get back my documents from the woman until the story was published,” she said. Mashonisa Malefu Tsubella said she was keeping the gogo’s Sassa card and ID, and was withdrawing R850 every month to cover the gogo’s debt. She said the gogo still owed R500 but refused to say what her interest was. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele advised people who had problems with the way cops dealt with their complaints to contact their station commander. “In this case, the matter was taken up with the commander to follow up why the complainant wasn’t helped.” “We urge residents not to hand over Sassa cards and ID books as this leads to exploitation. I received feedback that members went with Magdalene and her card was released.”
