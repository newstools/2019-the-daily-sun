Jazz has always had a special place in singer Judith Sephuma’s life. The highly acclaimed singer had, since the release of her gospel album One World four years ago, been yearning to come up with yet another jazz album. Her new 10-track offering, Power of Dreams, is the culmination of that dream. The album will be launched at Emperors Palace Theatre of Marcellus in Joburg next Friday. Like all her previous albums, Power of Dreams was released under her independent label, Lalomba Music. The album was recorded, mixed and mastered at Orange Peel Studios in Atlanta,US. Speaking to SunBuzz, Judith said: “I produced the album myself alongside US-based Joseph Williams to give my supporters the quality of sound that’s worth every penny you spend on it. “Williams has worked with great artists and bands such as Prince, Bobby Brown and BBD.” Judith also involved phenomenal Mzansi percussionist Tlale Makhene to bring out a traditional element. She sings most of the songs in Pedi. “The title song was written by my daughter Lethabo. I felt such a close connection with it that I decided to make it the title track,” she said The song is about the dreams of a young girl, which she finds resonance with as she wants all girls to succeed. Other songs on the album include Maropeng, A Man Like You and Tsotlhe. “I enjoy singing in my mother tongue, Pedi, because I’m able to express myself fully. Pedi is such a beautiful language,” she said. )  Tickets for the Power of Dreams launch are R200 at Computicket
