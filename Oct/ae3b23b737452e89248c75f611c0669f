Could this be the most expensive crash in history? A Porsche 911 GT2 RS recently crashed into a Pagani Huayra hyper
car at the Monza racetrack in Italy. Footage of the crash between the Porsche 911 GT2 RS and the Pagani
Huayra has surfaced on social media. In the video, the two cars can be seen lapping the Monza racetrack
and the 911 GT2 arrives much faster from behind, crashing into the side of the
Pagani. The Pagani Huayra is estimated to cost about R53.4 million,
while the Porsche 911 GT2 RS cost roughly about R9.85 million. What happens when a GT2 RS meets a Pagani Huayra BC on the track? Find out more in the video ???? Youtube link in Bio ??
