DO YOU want to add a little spice to your relationship? Well, Dominic Mabaso has answers for you. He owns an online store called Hunny Bunn, which sells sex toys. He encouraged black people to start using sex toys. The 29-year-old from Joburg told Daily Sun his business was more about education than about sales. Dominic said his target audience was anyone who’s sexually active, provided they were 18 years or older. “We cater to singles and couples. We also invite people from all genders, races and sexual orientation,’’ he said. He said Hunny Bunn is a fully black-owned company established in September 2016. “I got into this business because I could see how little we, as black people, knew about sexuality as a whole. “Even big white companies don’t make an effort to merge with Africans on something like condom advertising.” Daily Sun spoke to happy clients of Hunny Bunn. “But once I started, all was smooth. I love him, so being afraid wasn’t going to do much justice to our relationship,” she said. “My sex life was boring to be honest, but now I wouldn’t cheat on my partner, even if Nicki Minaj wanted me,” he told the People’s Paper. The toys start from as little as R150.
