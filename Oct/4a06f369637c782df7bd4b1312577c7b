WHEN Bonwabisi Dlamini saw bricks raining down on him, he jumped to save himself. His colleague wasn’t fast enough and was seriously injured. The 45-year-old from Umlazi, south of Durban, said he and two other men were digging a trench at a house on the Bluff on Tuesday when a wall collapsed. “The wall was very high and we were busy digging when it collapsed,” he said. “Two of us were in the trench and another worker outside.” Bonwabisi wasn’t sure what caused the collapse. “After it collapsed and bricks covered our colleague we pulled him out but he was injured, especially on the head. He was bleeding. “I called the homeowner, who contacted paramedics. Paramedics treated him before rushing him to hospital.” Bonwabisi said the incident left them in shock. “I returned to work on Wednesday, but our colleague was still in hospital. It was terrifying, but we need to work to earn money.” Bonwabisi said they had only been working for two days and were digging a trench for a new room next to the wall. Rescue Care paramedics spokesman Gareth Jamieson said the injured man was stabilised on the scene. The SunTeam tried to speak to the homeowner, but the woman refused to comment.
