DARK smoke could be seen rising from a building on Umgeni Road in Durban on Friday, and a tuck shop opposite the Home Affairs office was on fire. Luckily, the workers at the shop escaped unharmed. When the SunTeam arrived on the scene, it was business as usual and workers said only a portion of the storeroom was damaged. A worker said: “We were working when we saw smoke coming from the back. The firefighters were called and arrived in time to put out the fire.” The workers said the shop sold chips, sweets, airtime and bread. “The shop is at the bottom of the building and there are other rooms that people rent out, but they were not affected. We’re grateful no one was hurt,” said the worker. A man believed to be the owner of the building said he didn’t know what caused the fire. He refused to give his name or comment further.
