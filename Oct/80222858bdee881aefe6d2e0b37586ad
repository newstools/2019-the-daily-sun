A STROKE dramatically changed Mafusi Lebusho’s life 12 years ago. The 48-year-old from Hostel One in Mangaung, who lived with her three kids and her grandkids, is in a wheelchair.  The wheelchair later broke and she recently approached Daily Sun to ask for help from a Good Samaritan. She said: “The first wheelchair I was given by the hospital in 2007 broke a long time ago. “I spent months stuck in bed because I couldn’t afford a new one. “My neighbour was kind enough to lend me his, but now it has also broken. “It has become a struggle to go and collect my medication from the hospital. I can’t even get to a taxi because of the state of the wheelchair.” Mafusi said she asked the health department to get her a new wheelchair but was told the waiting list was very long. “My life is miserable and I don’t know how long I’ll have to suffer.” Free State health spokeswoman Palesa Matee told Daily Sun: “We can organise for her to meet with the CEO of Pelonomi Hospital. “We’ll also assist in getting her to a specialist who’ll take her through the process of getting another wheelchair.”
