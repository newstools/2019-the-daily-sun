THE CRL Rights Commission held a discussion today in Tshwane with organisations and state institutions to address xenophobia. Commission chairman Prof Luka Mosoma said organisations and government departments such as Home Affairs wanted to find the cause for xenophobia-related violence in Mzansi. “This can also be seen as a struggle for survival among those who feel their jobs are being taken by foreigners “Criminality was identified as the cause of looting and vandalism, especially in Gauteng,” Mosoma said. African Diaspora Forum member Ngqabutho Mabhena said South Africa should address problems which lead to poor service delivery, high unemployment and other challenges. Jackie McKay from Home Affairs said Mzansi has a total of 888 683 documented migrants and 184 975 asylum seekers. “People from the Southern African Development Community don’t need a visa as tourists but need a work permit to look for jobs. There’s huge abuse of this as they stay beyond the 90-day limit.” He said tensions were mainly with South Africans in kasis and squatter camps. Mzansi had high internal and external migration, a problem for local government. Mosoma said they hoped to come up with a clear view of causes and solutions to prevent the violence from happening again.
