THEY say no one has the power to shatter your dreams, unless you give it to them. This quote could be associated with the never-say-die attitude of former Baroka captain Letladi Madubanya who refuses to accept that his football career could be over. Having parted ways with Baroka FC towards the end of the past Absa Premiership season due to non-activity, Madubanya admits to having thought about retirement. “I toyed around the idea of retiring a lot. “But football is in my blood,” said Madubanya. The 35-year-old midfielder who has been out in the cold added: “I believe I still have few years to offer in the game. All I have to do now is to continue working hard, and I am positive that I will get a team. For now I am training on my own to keep fit. I have been in football for many years through hard work and discipline.” Madubanya said he enjoyed the two seasons he spent at Baroka: “I had a good time at Baroka despite not playing that much last season, but I cannot complain about a thing.” He was part of the Baroka team that made history by winning the Telkom Knockout in December last year when they saw off Orlando Pirates in Port Elizabeth to win their maiden cup. “So I left the club with my head held up high,” he said. Madubanya has been playing in the top flight for 13 years. Last season while contracted to Baroka, with a year still to run on his deal, the Alexandra-born claims to have asked Bakgaga coach Wedson Nyirenda to release him. That is when Nyirenda gave the captaincy to 24-year-old Mduduzi Mdantsane. Madubanya started at Tembisa Classic in 2005 before he joined Bay United, SuperSport United, Bidvest Wits, AmaZulu and Platinum Stars, among other clubs.
