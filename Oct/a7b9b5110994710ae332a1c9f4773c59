FAKE inyangas will not help you pass matric! This is a warning from KZN Traditional Healers’ Association president Sazi Mhlongo.  Mhlongo was reacting to an advert circulating on social media over the weekend. He said he heard about the advert and wanted to warn pupils to not take it seriously. Mhlongo, a former school principal, said a genuine traditional healer wouldn’t advertise his work but would get customers through referrals from people they’ve helped before. He said he won’t deny or agree that there’s muthi that can sharpen pupils’ minds to remember answers during exams. READ: LET US SELL SWEETS OR PUNANI! In a post seen by Daily Sun, a fake inyanga offers a pupil a bottle of herbs for R50 will make the marker think all the answers are correct. Many matric pupils told the People’s Paper that they’ve seen the post. A pupil said she was confused after seeing it. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said it was shocking. “It may be photoshopped but kids may take it seriously and visit those healers,” said Mahlambi.
