Mmusi Maimane may be going through a rough time after stepping down as DA leader and resigning from the party, but he has found apparent support in the form of EFF leader Julius Malema. After Maimane tweeted on Thursday that he had resigned from
the DA and as an MP, Malema reached out to him. He told Maimane: "I'm not home, but when I come back we
should have lenakana la monna wa mosepidi [a chat over whisky]. You are a good
human being, don't be discouraged, my big brother." Twitter users welcomed Malema's words, with some jokingly
suggesting that outgoing City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba also be
invited to join. This is not the first time that Malema appears to have
reached out to Maimane. In a statement on Thursday, the EFF expressed disappointment
in the resignation of Maimane. "As the EFF we worked with him well to unseat the
irreparably corrupt ANC following the outcomes of the 2016 Local Government
Elections. As leader of a white dominated DA, we could hold his hand in
protests that required all of us to put the country above ideological
differences. This is also because of his tenacity and absolute willingness to
hear and work out different perspectives," said spokesperson Mbuyiseni
Ndlozi. He said Maimane's resignation must go down in history as a
fundamental failure of non-racialism and democratic tolerance in the Democratic
Alliance. "Maimane almost always faced an impossible task in
leading the DA to transcend its white dominated nature." The EFF went on to commend the former leader for exposing
the DA as a party that cannot be an alternative to the ruling ANC.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/malemas-message-to-maimane-dont-be-discouraged-my-big-brother-20191024
