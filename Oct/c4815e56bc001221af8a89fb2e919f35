POLICE and the Gift of the Givers visited Oscar Mpetha High School in Nyanga on Tuesday to donate sanitary pads. Nyanga police spokeswoman Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi told pupils to stay away from drugs, focus on their studies and refrain from dating sugar daddies. “Don’t get involved with older men because you want to wear expensive clothes,” she said. Constable Marelda Abrahams told pupils to be careful of Toyota Avanzas. “If you only see men inside the Avanza, don’t get in because we have a lot of cases involving these cars,” she said. Pupils were urged to speak to teachers about domestic abuse. “Don’t hide anything. If someone is getting abused, report it to your teachers so they can get help,” Abrahams said. She said the cops donated sanitary pads as they didn’t want pupils to skip classes. Ali Sablay from the Gift of the Givers said the dignity of young women was important. “We hear some girls miss school for five days because they don’t have sanitary pads.” Nwabisa Sawutana (16) said she was happy to get the pads. Zimbini Ntshantsha (17) said the donation made a huge difference. “When it’s that time of the month, we get stressed because we have to use pieces of cloth.” Deputy principal Felicia Lutshaba said everyone at the school was very grateful.
