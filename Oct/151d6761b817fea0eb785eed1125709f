RESIDENTS are still furious about the death of a four-year-old boy who was hit by a car on 21 September. The road in C section, Botshabelo in Mangaung, is still barricaded with rocks placed by angry residents. Nthabiseng Molebatsi (33) said residents were angry at the driver. Some of the locals even tried to set the driver’s home alight. “There was chaos and we were very angry. The child died at the scene after the reckless driver took his life. Now the rocks are still here. I think this will teach speeding motorists a lesson,” said Nthabiseng. Pule Johnson (41) said innocent drivers and passengers were suffering as a result. “Right now, the rocks have not been removed and even taxis can’t pass,” said Pule. “Passengers are dropped off far away from their homes by taxis and buses. “Why did they not block the driver’s home with these rocks? This is unfair and really stupid.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele told Daily Sun no one was arrested during the protest.. “A case of culpable homicide was opened after a four-year-old boy was killed by a Toyota Corolla driven by a 32-year-old man,” he said. He said three children were crossing the main road after they went to a taxi, hoping to find their mother. The mother was not inside the taxi. “A four-year-old boy was hit by a passing car and died. Parents are advised to leave their children with neighbours when they are not around,” he said. “Residents are encouraged not to take the law into their own hands.”
