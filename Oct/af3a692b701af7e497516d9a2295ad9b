FORMER Chippa United coach Clinton Larsen has advised Orlando Pirates interim coach Rhulani Mokwena to “hang in there.” Mokwena is going through trying times at the Buccaneers as positive results have not come his way. In fact, despite showing a lot of potential, there hasn’t been much to cheer about since he was thrust into what is one of the biggest coaching jobs on the African continent. Since the former Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach took over in August, he is yet to convince the club’s demanding masses. He has won only once in seven games in charge. “Its not easy,” said Larsen. “I remember when we last played (before I got sacked) when they beat us, Rhulani’s words to me were ‘hang in there’ because Chippa were struggling and Pirates were also struggling at the time. “I said to him, ‘you hang in there too’ because I knew it was not going to be easy. “I was in a similar position when I was in his age when I started at Bloemfontein Celtic. Fadlu Davids (Mokwena’s assistant) was the same age when he started at Maritzburg United.” Ironically, Larsen lost his job after his former club Chippa lost 2-1 to Mokwena’s Pirates at Orlando Stadium on 16 September. It was Mokwena’s first win as coach of the Soweto giants. While Mokwena has divided opinions and more so with his ever-changing starting line- ups, Larsen said the best thing the budding coach can do is to trust in himself and his work. Since beating the struggling Chilli Boys, Pirates couldn’t build from that win as they lost to Bidvest Wits and drew with Cape Town City in Bucs following games. “As a coach you don’t ever doubt that you are not good enough to do it,” revealed Larsen who won the league title with Pirates during his playing days. “That will be the beginning of the end for you if you start to doubt yourself as coach. You’ve got to fully believe and back yourself and things will turn around.”
