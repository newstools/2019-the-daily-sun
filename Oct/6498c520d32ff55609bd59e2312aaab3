 Two
toddlers were burnt to death after being left home alone at Magau village in Limpopo. Police
spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said that the police called to the scene and
on arrival, they found the shack burning. The owner
of the shack, who is the father of the children alleged that he left with his
wife to collect woods at the nearby bushes, leaving his two children inside and
after some minutes, they received a call that their shack had caught fire and
the two toddlers were still inside. Ngoepe said
the children were found inside the shack burnt beyond recognition. The
deceased were identified as Tshilidzi Mulamu (3) and Tshinakaho Mulaudzi (2). Provincial
Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General
Nneke Ledwaba condemned the unacceptable behavior by some parents leaving their
children unattended. He also
sent his condolences to the family for the unforeseen circumstance of losing
the two toddlers.
