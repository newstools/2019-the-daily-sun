THE Mantengu family in Nkundusi Village in Mtubatuba, KZN, has many questions following a shooting in the family on Friday. Guzu (63) killed his sister Nqunqu (61) before turning the gun on himself. PROPHET RAPED AND CURSED ME! Guzu apparently left his room to pee outside, but instead went to his sister’s room. He waited for her to open the door before shooting her. He then went to the kraal, where he turned the gun on himself. Joseph Mantengu (56) said they were still puzzled by his brother’s actions. DEAD MAN SPEAKS AT HIS FUNERAL! “It happened in the early morning and the only person who was in the yard was Guzu’s wife, who was traumatised. “She said her husband left the room without saying anything, and she thought he was going to the toilet. “She heard gunshots a few minutes later but was too scared to go out.” Joseph said Guzu’s wife looked through the window and saw her sister-in-law lying in a pool of blood and her husband also lying in a pool of blood in the kraal. “She went out and called for help,” he said. Guzu’s niece Zama Ntengu (29) said: “My uncle was a peaceful person. We really don’t know why he did what he did.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a 61-year-old woman was found dead with gunshot wounds at her home in Nkundusi Reserve. “A case of murder was opened at Mtubatuba Police Station for investigation. “Her brother (63) was found with a gunshot wound to the head and his firearm next to him. “An inquest docket was also opened.”
