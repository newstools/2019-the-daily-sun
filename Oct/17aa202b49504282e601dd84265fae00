ORLANDO Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena has pleaded with their supporters to be patient with star Thembinkosi Lorch. READ: A SIGH OF RELIEF FOR MOKWENA Although he scored the all-important goal in their Telkom Knockout last-16 clash against Stellenbosch FC at the weekend, Lorch is yet to show his best form this season. In fact, the goal against Stellies was his first of the season. Before that, he had been a shadow of the player who scored 11 goals in all competitions last season. The 25-year-old was named 2018-19 Player of the Season and Player’s Player of the Season for his exploits. Mokwena believes it won't be long until he gets back to his best. "Lorch was unbelievable against Stellenbosch," said Mokwena. "I know people are losing a little bit of faith and patience in him but he will come good. He is the reigning footballer of the season for a reason. He's got the talent and he will show it. "He can get better, he knows that. He is very honest, he wants to always improve  and better his performances so he can contribute more to the team."
