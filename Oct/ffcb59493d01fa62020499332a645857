INJURIES continue to ravage the Bafana Bafana camp ahead of their Nelson Mandela Challenge encounter with Mali. Molefi Ntseki, who has already been forced to replace injured duo Thamsanqa Mkhize and Brandon Petersen in the squad, could be forced to make more. The duo were replaced by Bloemfontein Celtic defender Tshepo Rikhotso and Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Ricardo Goos. Ntseki could also be without star striker Percy Tau for Sunday’s (3pm) clash with The Eagles at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. Tau, who was expected to join his Bafana teammates on Tuesday, did not train with the team. Also watching from the side-lines was Strasbourg striker Lebo Mothiba, who appeared to be struggling with an injury of his own. French-based midfielder Bongani Zungu, who has a deep laceration on his left leg, also sat out Tuesday’s session. SuperSport United duo Dean Furman and Ronwen Williams trained on their own as they also look to shake off their respective niggles. Furman has been nursing a knee injury for a week or so while Williams has a slight shoulder problem.
