TAXI maths is a horror for the passenger who sits in the front seat, next to the driver. No one wants to sit there because of the embarrassing task of counting money! Yesterday, the SunTeam asked taxi drivers and operators at Bree Street Taxi Rank about having calculators in their vehicles. Winston Mandiwa said a calculator was a good idea because passengers often argued with the person counting the money. “The person in front is told they shouldn’t sit there if they don’t know maths,” he said. He said some drivers didn’t carry spare change and kept quiet when arguments started. Taxi driver Thabani Mncube asked who should buy the calculator. “The taxi belongs to the owner. Why would I use my money to buy it?” he asked. Passenger Sindisiwe Cebekhulu said taxi maths was not something she signed up for. “I hate maths. That’s why I’m studying humanities. But some taxi drivers ask why are you going to school if you can’t do simple calculations. “They must do it themselves,” she said. Amanda Mbatha said taxi drivers should look after their own money. “We just help them because we don’t want to get into accidents.” A taxi owner from Nanduwe laughed at the idea of having a calculator in the front seat. “Drivers are lazy. They should count the money. “It’s not a bad idea but will it last?” he asked.
