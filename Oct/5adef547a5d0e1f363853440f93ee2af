HE HAS a passion for art but fears he’s losing his dream. Collen Fehdzi (25) from Dhlamini, Soweto, started a course in art in 2017 at Funda Training Centre in Diepkloof, but has hit a dead end as he doesn’t have money to continue with his studies. “The school used to receive funding from established artists to help with our fees but I had to find money for some of the things I needed. I don’t get any serious financial support from my dad. It has been a frustrating journey. Sometimes I even think of quitting,” said Collen. He said he has to sell his artwork on the streets so he can get money to buy the materials needed at school. “My dad gives me money for the taxi to get to school.  “Sometimes when I’m short of material, I save the R30 to buy material and walk to school,” he said. “Things are just going from bad to worse. I don’t want to stay here anymore. I need a room to rent so I can focus on my studies. I’m struggling. I have no support at all.” He said his dad pays for his other siblings’ university fees. “I love art. I believe I will go far because I’m a distinction student. I’m pleading with anyone who can help me to contact the school or me.” Collen, who is doing his third year, needs help with a place to stay, food, art material and fees.
