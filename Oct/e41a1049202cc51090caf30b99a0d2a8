Notoane will announce the final squad for the competition in two weeks. “Before one can even think about the actual tournament, we first need to do well in Egypt this weekend,” said Sam after the SA U-23 were drawn in Group B alongside Ivory Coast, Zambia and Nigeria. “Going there (Egypt) is pressure on its own, if we fail to impress and don’t get positive results, we will miss out on the final selection. “The coach always reminds us that there are so many players hence we must not relax. There is a lot of expectation from us in the two games. “People have been comparing us to the past group that qualified for the Olympics in 2016, and I feel like we are capable of doing more than that. “Everyone in camp is looking forward to working towards our goal, which is to qualify for the Olympics.”
