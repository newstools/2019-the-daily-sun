JAPAN are riding a wave of support from their fans similar to the kind of adulation the All Blacks receive in New Zealand, Brave Blossoms scrumhalf Fumiaki Tanaka said. The World Cup hosts, who beat Russia in the opening game, sent local enthusiasm for the tournament soaring when they stunned Ireland 19-12 in Shizuoka on Saturday to grab control of Pool A. This is the scoreline that put them in contention for their first quarter-final place. “Fans gave us a guard of honour inside Tokyo Station and there are many people talking to us outside, too,” Tanaka said. “It feels as if we’ve become what the All Blacks are in New Zealand.” The 34-year-old is well aware of the importance of the three-time world champion All Blacks in New Zealand, having become the first ethnic Japanese player to sign a Super Rugby contract when he joined the Dunedin-based Otago Highlanders in 2013. Japan’s next match is against Samoa on Saturday in Toyota City. – REUTERS
