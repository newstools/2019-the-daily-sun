Phil Mphela (35) has always wanted to stand out from the rest. The entertainment commentator, co-host and founder of Moja Love’s entertainment show TMI (Too Much Information) moved to Joburg to make his dreams come true. Never afraid of calling a spade a spade, his fierce character gives Phil from Moruleng, near Rustenburg in the North West, the edge. Speaking to SunBuzz recently about his journey and about creating TMI, refers to entertainment and trending stories on social media. Phil said: “Everyone wants to be an actor, musician and dancer. But I chose to do something different.” He said his job is fun but also very tricky. “Every job or project has its own challenges,” he said. Phil said he had been pitching the TMI show since 2014 to different channels, and last year it got accepted by Moja Love. He said: “They liked the concept and made small changes and added two presenters, Ntando Duma and Gabisile Tshabalala, making it three including myself.” Phil saidthe second season was commissioned and began on 13 September after a successful first season. “People are happy with the new time slot,” he said. “We were previously on at 9pm and competing with Mzansi Magic’s The Queen, but now more people will be able to watch it. Describing his intentions, he said: “My goal is not just to be a guy on the internet. “I want to create content on platforms that are big enough for people to get.” He said TV in Mzansi is a huge platform. “I’m creating more shows for different people.” Phil said his life revolves around pitching shows and doing brand campaigns. “Being on Moja Love has been the happiest time of my life. “I’m a village boy who came to Joburg with big dreams and I’m fortunate enough to be able to work and fulfil them.”
