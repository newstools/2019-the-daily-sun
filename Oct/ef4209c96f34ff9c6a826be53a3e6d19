DURBAN cab driver Siboniso Ngcobo is furious at Babes Wodumo and her sister. He told Daily Sun he was hired by Babes’ sister and manager, Nondumiso Simelane, for two trips but they never paid him. Siboniso apparently drove them from Westville, Durban, to an event hosted by Dladla Mshunqisi at Wiseman’s Car Wash in KwaMashu last Tuesday. When they arrived, Babes refused to get out of the car. “She complained she wasn’t wearing makeup and her nails weren’t done. They asked me to drive them to Mayville instead,” he said. “They said they didn’t have cash on them. They even asked me to lend them R50 for newspapers and groceries.” He said Nondumiso asked him to drive them to uShaka Marine World later that day and promised to pay him the next day. “When I called Nondumiso last Wednesday asking for payment, she promised to do it that day,” said Siboniso. “They had not paid by the next day, and when I tried to contact them again they didn’t pick up the phone or reply to messages.” He said the sisters owed him R500 for the trips and the R50 they borrowed. Daily Sun phoned the sisters and their cellphones rang unanswered.
