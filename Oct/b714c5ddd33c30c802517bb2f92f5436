Senior citizens from Soweto were invited for a first-class trip on the Gautrain on Thursday morning. The Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport invited a group of 40 elderly people to experience the smooth train ride and provide feedback about their journey.

Despite the short journey, the first-time passengers' faces lit up with joy and excitement as the train glided over the tracks. "It's so smooth!" one passenger exclaimed. Lizzie Magida, 85, said she had been scared when boarding the train underground because it was dark, but that she enjoyed her journey. "When I am on the train, I get to sleep nicely because I'm safe there," said 82-year-old Anna Lebeko, who was impressed with the comfort of the journey. After the trip, the group met with Public Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo. "This came as a result of a request that they made when we were marking our 100 days in office, which I chose to do in Soweto," Mamabolo explained. He said the feedback was important to improve the mode of transport and help make it more inclusive for everyone. "Interestingly, they raised the issue about being able to afford the price of Gautrain," he admitted. Mamabolo said a conversation about how the department could make the Gautrain more affordable for elderly people was necessary.
