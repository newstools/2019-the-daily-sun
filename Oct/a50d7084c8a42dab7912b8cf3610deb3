A key informant who helped lead US Special Forces to ISIS Leder Abu
Bakr al-Baghdadi provided key information about the Isis leader's safe house in
Syria. He even produced his soiled underwear for DNA testing. The informant provided Baghdadi's dirty underpants to
'make sure (100%) that the person in question was Al Baghdadi himself', tweeted
Polat Can, a senior official with the Kurdish Democratic Forces. The informant also provided a blood from the Isis leader
to further prove his access to the Jihadist. US intelligence officials used the samples to get a
positive DNA match on Baghdadi, to set the raid in motion. The underwear was
stolen about three months ago and the blood sample was taken roughly a month ago,
a Kurdish official told NBC. Kurdish intelligence operatives who supervised the
informant passed the intelligence on to American forces before they raided
Baghdadi's safe house. The unidentified informant, an undercover security
advisor to Baghdadi, was also on hand at the compound in Idlib, northwest Syria,
when US Special Ops forces raided the safe house to confront the terrorist
leader. Baghdadi, 48, the elusive leader of the Islamic State,
killed himself and three of his children by deploying a suicide vest as US
forces stormed the compound Saturday night. General Mazloum Abdi of the Syrian Democratic Forces said
the Baghdadi informant described a room-by-room layout of the terror leader's
compound on the Turkish border, including the number of guards, floor plan and
tunnels, reports NBC News.
