SINGER Lwazi M has accused Tipcee of stealing her song. Lwazi said she saw a snippet of a song titled Impi Yegqom on Tipcee’s Instagram page, but she had released the track last year. The 27-year-old from Durban said she found out the track would be on Tipcee’s new album, due for release next month. “Impi Yegqom is the single I’m currently pushing. I perform it everywhere I go. The snippet she shared has exactly the same lyrics as my song. “The only difference is I say my name in the song and she says hers in her version. After releasing the song, I registered it and everyone knows it,” she said. “It’s not fair. I worked hard to make this song. I didn’t copy it from a book or anything like that. The lyrics came from my brain. It’s impossible that she thought of the exact same thing.” When contacted for comment, Tipcee said she didn’t know who Lwazi was and she shouldn’t lie about her. “I’ve never seen this girl. I don’t know what she sings and I’ve never even heard her songs. “She wants fame using my name and she won’t get it,” she said. “She must go back to the studio and work hard like we do. We don’t sleep. “We’re always in the studio and people can’t just come and claim songs we’ve worked hard for.” Lwazi said she recently sang the song at the uPhongolo Summer Carnival earlier this month and suggested Tipcee might have heard it there as she also performed there. The People’ Paper listened to the two songs and there is most definitely a similarity in both style and lyrics, as pointed out by Lwazi.
