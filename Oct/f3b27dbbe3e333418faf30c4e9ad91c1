A MAN bearing a strong resemblance to Elvis Presley has been accused of stealing a fake punani from a New Zealand sex shop, prompting a police investigation. The Elvis lookalike allegedly stole the prosthesis from the Peaches and Cream sex store in suburban Auckland, after a failed attempt to buy it. “He was very energetic and erratic, going around the shop, talking a lot. . . he brought a sex toy called Like a Virgin up to the counter, but his card declined,” staff member Kat Maher said. Kat said the man then ran out of the shop with the NZ$100 (about R950) sex toy in hand. His Elvis-like characteristics included slicked-back black hair and large sunglasses. New Zealand police confirmed they had received a report of a theft at the store on 23 September. The store, frustrated with repeat shoplifting incidents, posted stills from CCTV footage on social media in an effort to help track down the thief. – NEWS24
