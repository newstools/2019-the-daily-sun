“WHAT happened to freedom of expression? Why are there still men policing women’s bodies in 2019?” These were questions asked by actress and exotic dancer, Noluvuyo “Bubbly” Sodela after she was kicked out of a shisa nyama in the north of Joburg on Saturday, apparently for being inappropriately dressed. PUNANI ROCKS TAVERN! The actress, who used to be in a series called Ihawu, said she was chilling at the shisa nyama with her friends.  “It was prejudiced of them to throw me out of their premises, alleging I was wearing an offensive piece of clothing. This came as a surprise to me as they threw me out after I was there for two hours,” she said. PANTIES OR NOT, FUN GOES ON! Bubbly told the SunTeam she was wearing a black jumpsuit with slits up to her thighs. She said she was allowed in with no problem but she later walked her friend to her car and was told she couldn’t go back in. “On my way back in, a few ladies asked to take a picture with me and I agreed. Just after that a guard approached me and said the manager said I shouldn’t come back in because of the way I was dressed. “When I asked about the drinks and food I bought, they wouldn’t give me answers.” ANCESTORS CAN’T SEE MY REVEALING DRESS! Bubbly said there were other people wearing bum shorts and crop tops. “If they had a problem, they should have told me when they let me in. I felt humiliated and my mood changed. “It wasn’t like I was revealing private parts.” VILLAGE DRAG QUEEN AND AGEING LEGS IN SPOTLIGHT At the time of going to print, the shisa nyama had not responded to the SunTeam’s queries but promised to respond today.
