KAIZER Chiefs have made it three-by-three! Ernst Middendorp's charges stretched their lead at the top of Absa Premiership table by six points. Their 2-0 win against Golden Arrows at the FNB Stadium on Tuesday was enough to put a smile on Middendorp's face. Defender Daniel Cardoso opened the scoring through penalty 25 minutes into the game while before Nkosinathi Sibisi scored an own goal in the 60th minute. Their third consecutive wins started with a 2-0 win against AmaZulu, 1-0 against Baroka before defeating another KZN side in Arrows. The Soweto giants now lead the pack on 19 points from eight matches. Their sixth win in eight outings was a huge morale boost for Chiefs ahead of their clash with Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns in the Shell Helix Cup at the same venue next Saturday. Middendorp made three changes to his starting line-up due to an injury crisis with goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi replacing Itumeleng Khune, while veteran midfielder Willard Katsande made a rare start in the absence of George Maluleka. The German born mentor also gave youngster Njabulo Blom his professional debut in place of Reeve Frosler who also sustained an injury against Bakgaga. The 19-year-old defender was rested in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge against Black Leopards at the weekend to ensure he is ready to rub shoulders with the big boys. Blom never disappointed as he played like a seasoned campaigner owning the right wing-back position with aplomb until he was replaced by Lorenzo Gordinho in the 81st minutes. In other matches, AmaZulu bounced back to Benni McCarthy's Cape Town City 2-1 at Princess Magogo, while Bidvest Wits beat struggling Chippa United 1-0 at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in the Eastern Cape.
