Angola have a much-changed team at the tournament this year with the bulk of the 2018 squad currently preparing for the 2019 FIFA Under-17 World Cup in Brazil. This means there will be a new champion crowned after Mozambique and Zambia won through to the decider with semifinal victories on Friday.Mozambique defeated Eswatini 1-0, before 2017 winners Zambia ousted defending champions Angola 2-0 in the second Last 4 match. The fixtures were once again played in front of an impressive crowd with no shortage of support from expatriates in the crowd in what was a lively atmosphere. Impressive beanpole striker Valdemiro Domingos was a threat throughout for Angola with his neat play and his deft header needed some smart work from Zambia goalkeeper Iford Mwale.
