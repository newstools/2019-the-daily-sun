KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says fringe players must raise the bar and prove that they want to be part of his starting line-up. Middendorp is expected to give more fringe players like Siphelele Ntshangase, Kabelo Mahlasela, Joseph Molangoane and Philani Zulu a chance to prove their worth next weekend when Amakhosi tackle Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic. “You need these competitions (Shell Helix and Macufe). I will repeat it, certain players sit on the back-foot, not going into it (not committed). We ask for improvement, ask them to do stuff differently in training. We now have a game in Bloemfontein and we will use an additional player group really saying ‘okay I am ready, I will show you I have improved, I have directed my style and way to play.’” The German-born said other players make things difficult instead of sticking to the basics. “Football is about passing, receiving and finishing. That’s simple and easy. When I am passing and receiving but I don’t finish as an attacking player, then something is missing. When I am finishing and can’t do the other side it’s okay because the value of finishing is probably a bigger one as an attacker.” Middendorp said others should learn from players like Khama Billiat, who doubled his work-rate to help Amakhosi beat Golden Arrows 2-0 in their last Absa Premiership match at FNB on Tuesday night. He went on: “I am absolutely impressed by Khama Billiat. He contributed to the team’s performance in terms of transition from attack to defence. This is a process and something really earned him man of the match and my respect. He is close to 10 out of 10 and this is something we really need to mention. If you really need to challenge (for the title), you need everybody attacking and defending. This is so much going on at the moment, not only with players on the field, but also those in the training ground.”
