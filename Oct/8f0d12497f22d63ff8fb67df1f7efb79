Mpumalanga cops have raided houses believed to be brothels. These brothels are suspected to be housing local women and foreign nationals in Emalahleni. The operation came after reports of prostitution happening around the area. Earlier this week houses occupied by foreign nationals were burnt down after a woman was allegedly raped. The 39-year-old woman managed to escape from the house she was kept in and informed taxi drivers who then reacted. Mpumalanga police spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said there are several complains that police gathered from the public. "We cannot allow this situation to continue and, in the process, we also found that some of these women are here in the country illegally because they don't have proper documentation. â€œAll of these women are coming from different provinces in the country and those who don't have documentation will be sent back home," he said. Hlathi said they have also uncovered that some of the women are here not on their own will but have been brought in the area and managed to the culture of selling their bodies. "When you come here you are subjected to rape and after that you are fed drugs and given a small room at which you have to pay about R150," he said. "These are the things that we are supposed to discourage as the community as the police cannot deal with this problem alone. We also need other departments and NGOs so that we can work together because at the end of the day, the blame is going to be passed on the police," he said. Over 100 people were taken for interviews. Hlathi said the operation is expected to continue across the province.
