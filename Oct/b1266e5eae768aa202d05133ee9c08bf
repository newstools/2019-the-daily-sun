SUNSPORT understands that Black Leopards have continued with their buying spree and on the verge of signing three players. It has come to our attention that Tshepo Tema, formerly with Free State Stars, Bangali Keita from Chippa United and Thobani Mncwango are training with Lidoda Duvha with the hope of securing contracts. Leopards are under new coach Luc Eymael who has not had a bad start for the club, but indications are that he would like to bring in his soldiers to beef the Venda side. Tema, the 31-year-old centre-back, is currently clubless after parting ways with Free State Stars who were relegated to the GladAfrica Championships. He was initially believed to have joined the club, but he is now back training under Eymael. The 26-year-old Keita, who hails from Guinea, has been with Chippa but has run out of favour and is currently out looking for a safe nest. Mncwango, who is also 31, was last seen at Bidvest Wits last year when he moved from Polokwane City.
