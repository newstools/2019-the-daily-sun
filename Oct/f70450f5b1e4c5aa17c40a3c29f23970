THE IFP has expressed shock at the murder of Msinga councillor Khaya Sithole (30). Msinga mayor Buyiswa Ngcobo said she and municipal councillors had earlier visited Sithole’s ward to introduce a contractor who’d install electricity. She said she had just returned home when she got a call informing her Sithole had been murdered. “We’re still shocked and disturbed, but we know his murder was not political because there’s no political violence in Msinga,” said the mayor. “We visited his family on Friday, but everyone was still too shocked to discuss what could have caused it.” IFP sources said Sithole had three taxis, and that his murder could be related to taxi violence.  But Ngcobo denied this, saying the taxis belonged to his brother who was killed in December. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said two murder cases were opened by Msinga police but would be taken over by the police task team investigating political killings in KZN. He said both victims were shot in the upper body and were rushed to hospital, where they died. “The suspect fled the scene on foot and no arrests have been made,” said Naicker.  National chairman Blessed Gwala called on police to find the killers. He said the party didn’t want to make assumptions.
