TWO young women in KZN are missing. Unisa student Cishani Zuma (23) from Howick was last seen by her family on Saturday when she went to visit her sister, Samke Zuma (25), in Pietermaritzburg. Samke said: “I waited for her. I sent her a WhatsApp at 7.30pm but it didn’t go through. Her phone was off and my mum and her flatmate hadn’t seen her.” Samke then tried to call her in the morning but her phone was still off and on Monday, she went to check her at her flat in Durban. “She was not there. I went home to Howick and we went to the cops. They told us to come back the next day. We’re still trying to open a case. She has never disappeared before. She might be in danger,” said Samke. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane was unable to provide information as their system was down and there was no answer at Howick cop shop. Meanwhile, Scottburgh mum Qiniso Cele (39) is praying for the safe return of her daughter, Thobeka Cele (18). She was last seen on 16 September when she went to a spaza shop. “She was with her sister (10) but she sent her to go and buy chips. “When her sister came home, Qiniso hadn’t returned. She hasn’t been seen since. I’m terrified,” said the mum Captain Nqobile Gwala said a missing persons case was opened at Scottburgh cop shop after Thobeka went missing.
