A ONE-YEAR-OLD baby boy died while his mum was doing vosho! The mum allegedly left the baby with her sister’s two kids, aged four and six, and went out to booze at a shebeen at Number One Village in Taung. The kids alerted neighbours after they noticed the baby wasn’t moving. A neighbour told Daily Sun: “The woman’s nephews asked me about their aunts’ whereabouts. “I asked them why they were looking for her at midnight when they should be sleeping and they took me to the house. “I saw the baby wasn’t breathing or moving.  I immediately alerted other neighbours, who went to get the woman from the shebeen.” Residents wanted to moer the mum when she returned from the shebeen in the early hours of Saturday, but she locked herself in the house. One of the shebeen patrons, Moagi Mosikare, said: “The mother was at the shebeen dancing vosho in a circle while men cheered for her.” The People’s Paper tried to speak to the mum, but she refused. No case was registered with the police.
