THE Mkhatshwas in Witbank, Mpumalanga, are desperate for help in finding their daughter. Fezile Mkhatshwa (28) went missing on 12 June.  According to her sister Zandile (29), Fezile left home to meet with her husband at the Highveld Mall but never returned. She said her sister told them that after meeting with her husband she’d go to a business meeting. “We waited for her return but she never came back,” Zandile told Daily Sun. “We started searching for her but couldn’t find her.” They tried everything to find their missing sister, including consulting traditional healers. She told the SunTeam they don’t know if Fezile is alive or not, and this was painful. “It would have been better knowing she’s deaad than not knowing at all,” she said. “We don’t know if she’s safe. All we need is closure.” She said the family was frustrated and appealed to anyone with information to come forward. Witbank police spokesman Sergeant David Ratau confirmed that a missing persons case was opened and that police were investigating.
