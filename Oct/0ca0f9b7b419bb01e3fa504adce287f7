MPUMALANGA Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has urged residents of Schulzendal in Nkomazi to make use of health facilities. She was speaking at the official opening of the R7,8 million Schulzendal Clinic on Friday. The MEC said it was pointless for people to protest and demand facilities, which they ended up not using. “We didn’t build this clinic because you protested, but because there was a need for it in this community. If you weren’t here, we weren’t going to build this clinic. It’s yours. Make use of it,” she said. Manzini said people shouldn’t wait to be bedridden before they visited clinics. “Go to clinics. Consult as early as you can to avoid clashing with the nurses. Don’t come with your stresses and insult our nurses. “They too are people and need to be respected,” said Manzini. She said most people waited until it was too late to seek medical help. She said they then went to clinics and complained when they weren’t attended to on time. “Don’t think about the clinic after your home remedies fail you because the next thing you’ll complain about long queues and accuse our staff of failing to assist you.” The clinic was built near the Swaziland border. It started operating on 27 September and already helped more than 200 people. “We have a responsibility that when a person is sick, we must attend to them. We can’t deny them the right to health because they’re undocumented,” she said. Previously, the community had to go to Driekoppies, Jeppes Reef and other areas for healthcare. Resident Mduduzi Shabangu (42) said he was grateful for the clinic. “We used to travel more than 5km to consult, but now it will be easy for everyone. This means we’ll save the little money we have. “We’re happy and we’ll make sure it’s not vandalised,” he said.
