 KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has a habit of complaining about his players that represent their countries on international duty. Not so long ago, the outspoken German tactician complained about Amakhosi’s talisman Khama Billiat when he was called up to the Zimbabwean national team in the previous Fifa break. Now the former Maritzburg United coach has shifted his focus on lanky Bafana Bafana defender Eric Mathoho and SA Under-23 pair Siyabonga Ngezana and Happy Mashiane. Mathoho was in Molefi Ntsiki’s Bafana team that played Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge yesterday in Port Elizabeth. Ngezana and Mashiane were in Egypt featuring in two friendly matches in Cairo. If it were up to Middendorp, neither Ngezana nor Mashiane would have gone with Young Bafana. Middendorp is worried about an injury to Mathoho and wanted to know if the defender was injured or not, so that he can make plans on his replacement for their next game. He said that he had tried several times to contact Safa to get an update on Mathoho to no avail. “I don’t know what is happening,” he said. “I tried to get something out of the technical team at Safa but could not get through to them. I don’t know in what kind of a state he will be in when he comes back. It is important for us to know his condition, but no one is saying anything at Safa.”
