In this day and age, one canâ€™t help but ask what the motive is behind the use of cellphones in the bedroom. The Daily Sun front page story of 2 October, of a councillor and ward committee member having sex, was disturbing. I was also shocked by the story of a prison warder, published in the same newspaper, on 25 September. It seems to be a trend these days to blackmail people with cellphone videos, yet others continue to use cellphones during sex. Before you know it, everyone knows about your dirty laundry. I hope such stories will serve as an eye-opener to those who are thinking of recording their bedroom secrets. I wonder what would happen if you were to lose your phone after making such a video. Beware of the aftereffects of poor decisions made in the heat of the moment. - Letter from Lifi in Burgersfort.
