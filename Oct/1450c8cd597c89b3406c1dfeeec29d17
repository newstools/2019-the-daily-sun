THE tickets for the Telkom Knockout quarter final match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates have been SOLD OUT! Durban people once again showed their passion for football as they wasted little time snapping up tickets to watch what the biggest match is in the PSL calendar. A number of people who rushed to the tickets outlets in Durban have confirmed to SunSport that they were turned back and told tickets were sold out – just  hours after  going on sale. The 167th derby is set to take place at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium next weekend on Saturday. Last year’s TKO semi-final at the same venue, tickets were also sold out within two hours after the opening sale. When also these teams met in the MTN8 final in 2014 also at the very same venue, fans made their money talks. They were sold out in less than three hours.
