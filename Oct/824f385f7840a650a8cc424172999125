Radio and Television personality Anele Mdoda found herself at the centre of a social media storm this weekend following her comments on former Destiny’s Child band member Kelly Rowland's looks. The since deleted tweet by Mdoda suggested that Kelly was not as good looking as many people believed. This after TV personality Sizwe Dhlomo said she was the prettiest member of Destiny's Child. The now deleted tweet, Mdoda said Rowland only “looks amazing with makeup”, adding that she had “receipts”.   She went on to share her "receipts" by posting a picture of Kelly without make-up. Anele's tweet did not sit well with social media users! The comments saw her receive major black lash on Twitter as Mzansi tweeps called her out on her hateful comment, inclusing American's defending Kelly.
