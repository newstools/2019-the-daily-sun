MTUBATUBA cops are investigating a case of murder and an
inquest after a brother shot and killed her blood sister in Nkundusi village in
Mtubatuba, north of Kwazulu-Natal. It alleged that Guzu Mantengu (63) left his room and went
to the backroom where his younger sister Nqunqu Mantengu (61) lives. Once in the room, Guzu just drew his
gun and shot at his sister without saying a word. The sister died instantly. Guzu then proceeded to the kraal where he shot himself in the head. He died on the spot. Their sibling Joseph Mantengu (56) said it is not yet
clear what really happened. “When the incident happened, the only person who was in
the yard was Guzu's wife. However, she was in her room when the incident
happened.  She said her husband left the
room without saying anything to her. “She thought he was just going to the toilet as it is
outside.  A few minutes later, she heard a gunshot but was too scared to go outside. She then peeped through the window and saw
her sister-in-law lying in a pool of blood,” he said. Guzu's niece, Zama Ntengu (29), said they are still shocked as her uncle had never fought with their aunt before. “My uncle was a peaceful person and he didn’t mention
anything to his wife before the incident. 
“We really don't know why he did what he did,” she said. KZN cops spokesperson Nqobile Gwala confirmed the
deaths. They have opened a case of murder and an inquest.
