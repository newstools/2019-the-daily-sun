LECTURES are expected to resume at the University of Zululand today after being suspended over two weeks ago following violent student protests. The protests started on 16 September and carried on for a week, with students were demanding safety at off-campus residences. During the protests, a satellite cop shop was torched on campus and the looting of a bookshop was reported. Spokeswoman Gcina Nhleko-Mdluli said after careful assessment by the university, management decided it was in the students’ best interests to resume lectures. “Management decided to lift the suspension of academic activities and permit students to return to the campus and residences.” She said there were a few conditions that students needed to obey. These included not taking part in any illegal protest action or activity, or behaving in any way that was a threat to peace and security on campus and residences, or interfering with the academic programme. She said students involved in criminal or internal disciplinary proceedings were not allowed to enter the campus and residences. The protests caught the attention of Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande, who called a media briefing last Monday, and announced that safe accommodation housing 3 500 students would be built over the next three years.
