AS THE Northern Cape faces yet another heatwave, Kimberley has entered the fourth week of a water crisis. Residents said they boil the water and add bleach before drinking it because they’re concerned about its quality.  Some said they had suffered from diarrhoea after drinking the water. They said the problem started after water pumps were upgraded last month. But Sol Plaatjie Municipality claimed water tests were done daily. Resident Thabo Mooki said: “We often boil the water and add bleach before drinking it. “Ever since upgrades were done at the Newton Reservoir, we’ve been having water cuts and the water hasn’t been up to standard. “The water is clear, but we suffer from diarrhoea. I believe the municipality wants us to protest before this is taken seriously. Clearly, whoever is in charge doesn’t know what they’re doing.” READ: SHE KILLED BOYFRIEND FOR IMPREGNATING ANOTHER WOMAN Kedibone Mosala, the owner of a fast food business, said the water situation was making her life hard. “We use water to cook and I have to buy purified water, which is costly,” she said. Municipal spokesman Sello Matsie said the water was tested for germs, hardness and mineral levels. “All these levels are within the standard requirements set by the water affairs department, indicating there are no issues with the quality of the water,” he said.
