A RAPE suspect was expected to appear in the Upington Regional Court on Monday but didn’t show up. Now cops are looking for him. He is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl who has cerebral palsy seven years ago. The trial was set to begin on Monday. The girl’s mother reported the rape to cops in Rosedale, Northern Cape, in August 2012 after her daughter told her about the incident. NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said: “The case was scheduled for Monday and the suspect did not come to court. Social worker Inge Reichert said she became aware of the case in March 2013. “I was assigned to investigate the fitness of the child’s mother to perform her parental duties. This was motivated by the mother’s alcohol abuse, which prevented her from properly caring for her three children. “The girl was placed in safety care for six months and when she ended up with a foster parent, she shared details of the rape. The girl was medically examined and the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit got involved.” Sergeant Ompile Masegela said: “A warrant of arrest was issued by the court and the suspect is wanted by the police.”
