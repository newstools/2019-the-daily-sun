FOLLOWING the resignation of former Joburg Mayor Herman
Mashaba, Mzansi didn’t waste time letting Federal Council Chairperson of the DA
Helen Zille what they think her. Mashaba said he resigned because of the direction the
Democratic Alliance is heading. He said the re-election of Zille
represents victory for people in the DA who stand opposed to the his believes
and value system. Mashaba said he cannot reconcile himself with a group of
people who believe that race is irrelevant in the discussion of inequality and
poverty in South Africa in 2019. Tweeps made it a point of comparing the Zille with anything
and everything under the sun, even saying the current heatwave is bad and abnormal
but ‘ClearlybetterthanZille’.
