WHEN Windy Lepota’s daughter got engaged, she was very happy for her. But the wedding, taking place in December, is causing her a lot of stress . She doesn’t know where guests will sleep or eat as her family of five is squashed into a one-roomed shack. For the past three years, the 48-year-old had been waiting for her RDP in Nellmapius extension 21, Tshwane, to be completed. She said workers built the foundation and disappeared. They returned in 2017 and built walls but stopped work again. “They came again last year to install the roof, but this time I had no hope they’d complete the house. They proved me right by not finishing the roof,” said Windy. “It will be embarrassing to have a wedding in an unfinished house.” When contacted, Councillor Joel Masilela said a programme was in place to complete the houses.
