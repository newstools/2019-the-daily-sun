OLE GUNNAR SOLSKJAER has admitted he would love to have a striker like Harry Kane - after Manchester United legend Roy Keane told him to sign the Spurs ace.According to The Sun website, Old Trafford icon Keane ordered United to go out and sign the £250million-rated England captain. Solskjaer admits it would be tricky to land Kane from Spurs, but knows he could do with a striker of that ilk to fire his struggling side up the table.The Red Devils have hit just eight goals in their last 11 games, slipping into the bottom seven in the Premier League.Responding to Keane's demand, Solskjaer admitted he was a Kane fan.He said: "I have to say I like someone who can finish half a chance and he does that. He's one of the best, but he's a Tottenham player."There aren't many (Robert) Lewandowskis and Harry Kanes. They're like (Alan) Shearer, (Ruud) Van Nistelrooy - fantastic goalscorers."United are ruing their decision not to replace Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez in the summer.Both moved to Inter Milan. Lukaku for £73m and Chilean Sanchez on a season-long loan. But the long-term injury to Anthony Martial has been a hammer blow to Solksjaer's plans.Blunt Keane told United this week on Sky Sports: "Go and get Kane from Spurs, it's easy. What are you all staring at?"Go and buy him.”
