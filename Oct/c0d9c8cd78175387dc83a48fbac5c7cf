PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has urged people working in healthcare to say no to bribes. He was speaking at the launch of the Health Sector Anti-Corruption Forum at the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday. The forum was made up of the presidency, the health, justice and military departments, along with the Hawks special investigating unit, Medical Schemes Council, Financial Intelligence Centre and other institutions. Ramaphosa said: “I would like to invite all of us to work together to cut out the scourge of corruption.” He said it was found there was political interference in the health sector. The launch was also attended by Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and NPA head Shamila Batohi, who said the biggest problem with fighting corruption was lack of resources. “The first step has been taken by the president to protect the National Health Insurance fund from corruption,” said Mkhize.
