A PUPIL (19) is nursing his wounds after he was assaulted, apparently for making noise in class on Friday. According to his mum, he was caught talking in class and the teacher instructed him to leave.  “He told me the teacher instructed him to leave the class until his period was over,” said the mum. “But the teacher became furious when he returned to the classroom. “The same day three men kidnapped my son and attacked him. They forced him into a car, tied him up next to a tree with cables, and beat him.” READ: COFFIN ESCAPES UNDERTAKERS!
