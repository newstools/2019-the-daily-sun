THE ANC’s resolution committee has instructed the Limpopo PEC to investigate allegations made by members in the Waterberg region. The two bodies also agreed that matters relating to suspended provincial treasurer Danny Msiza and deputy chairwoman Florence Radzilani should be dealt with by the integrity commission, as soon as possible. PEC members were summoned to Luthuli House in Joburg on Monday to resolve unrest in Waterberg relating to the two suspended officials. The two were fingered in the VBS scandal. Provincial spokesman Donald Selamolela said they agreed with the committee that four allegations of corruption in the municipality must be investigated. There were also incidents in the region where members allegedly trying to fight corruption were murdered. ANC Waterberg spokesman Matome Tauatsoala said they hoped the NEC and the committee would help unify the party. “We’re hopeful the ANC will come up with a programme that will unite us, instead of dividing us further. The first lesson they should give to ordinary members is to welcome congress outcomes and extend a hand to those who lost after contesting,” he said. Members in Limpopo recently protested at the party’s provincial headquarters to prevent a PEC meeting. They said the NEC members sent to Limpopo should not allow any PEC meetings until the corruption allegations were dealt with. Selamolela confirmed the PEC was summoned to Luthuli House but said he couldn’t discuss internal matters until meeting with the resolution committee.
