PUPILS in Mnqobokazi in Hluhluwe, northern KZN, no longer have a high school after it was torched yesterday morning. A source suspected parents who had a problem with the principal. “He’s new but used to run another school in uMkhanyakude. His former school was known for having a poor pass rate, so parents said they didn’t want him at their school.” READ: I DANCE NAKED FOR MONEY! The source claimed the principal was forced to leave his former school as there were several complaints that he shaved off the hair of pupils belonging to the Nazareth Baptist Church. “He was even called to court for shaving their hair,” said the source. “This is another reason parents didn’t like him. They think he’s bad news.” SGB chairwoman Phindile Mabika said there was too much conflict among parents.

Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A case of arson is being investigated.”
