  IF DUDU Myeni doesn’t appear for her next court hearing, the
case will continue without her. This is the warning from the North Gauteng High Court to
former SAA board chairwoman, Dudu Myeni. Myeni has been absent from court since Monday. On Thursday, she brought an application before Judge Ronel
Tolmay through her new advocate, Nqabayethu Buthelezi, to postpone the matter. Buthelezi said they want a postponement to prepare. The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the SA Airways
Pilots’ Association want her to be declared a delinquent director. Advocate for Outa, Carol Steinberg, asked Myeni’s advocate
why they were asking for a postponement, as her affidavit on Wednesday said
they wanted to raise funds for legal representation. On Monday, Myeni claimed she could not afford transport to
get to Tshwane. The case was adjourned to Tuesday but her former lawyer,
Advocate Daniel Mantsha said she has been trying to get money to cover her
legal costs, but she was unsuccessful. Judge Tolmay said she wanted assurance that if she granted
the postponement, there won’t be any delays. “This is a civil matter and a warrant of arrest can’t be
issued against her. If she fires her latest lawyer the case can go on without
her,” said the judge. The judge said the case can resume on 21 October for two
weeks, then stands down from 25 November until December enabling defence to
prepare. If Myeni is declared a delinquent director, it could mean
that she will be barred from serving as a director and senior executive on the
board of South African organisations for a period of seven years or more.
