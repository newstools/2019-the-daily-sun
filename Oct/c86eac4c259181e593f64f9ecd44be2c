MZANSI decides to join on the Halloween Fun by sharing their scary stories. Though you certainly don't need an excuse to dig into a spooky ghost story or horrifying tale of unthinkable crimes, Halloween is certainly a good time to crack open a ghastly narrative. Of course, the scary story genre is not for everyone but if you enjoy gut-churning, heart-pounding words, in small doses, you’ll want to check out this collection of scary short stories told by Mzansi. Even though some stories are scary, some are just funnier than sending shivers down our spines. Some stories were told by our parents and some people are still passing them to their grandchildren. Remember what you were told about counting stars at night? You know those shops always rumored to be productive because there’s something making that family stronger? Yep, those rumors still exist.
