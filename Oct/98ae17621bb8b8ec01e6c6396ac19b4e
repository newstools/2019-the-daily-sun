SOLDIERS took a well-deserved break on Wednesday. They donated computers at Ribane Laka Secondary School in Mamelodi, Tshwane. Air force chief, Lieutenant-General Zimpande Msimang, told matrics there was nothing wrong with failing, as long as they picked themselves up. “I love you. Keep dreaming. Dreams do become a reality,” he said. “You should know and understand your history and appreciate your communities.” District education director Hilda Kekana was pleased to receive 20 laptops. Principal Martha Ngoma said: “We have a good culture of teaching and learning. “We’re succeeding because the school has a structured intervention programme.”
