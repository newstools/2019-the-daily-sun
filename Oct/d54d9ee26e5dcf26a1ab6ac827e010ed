Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says motorists will face less headache on the M2 Highway. On Thursday, Mashaba announced that work on the closed section of the M2 Highway will be completed on the 30th of October 2019. In August, the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) began a R58 million emergency repair to sections of the highway, after assessments revealed that the structural integrity of the concrete elements were severely reduced.  The mayor said: “I stood on that bridge, I felt the vibrations, and I saw first-hand the cracks in the supporting structures. There is no doubt that this was a life-saving and very necessary decision.” Mashaba further said if the budget for rehabilitation was not carried out soon, the sections of the bridge could have collapsed.  “The M2 highway would have been closed to traffic and the congestion on roads around and in the inner city would have dramatically increased.” HE said the condition of roads across the City of Johannesburg have been a matter of concern to him.  “Not only do they need to be safe for public use, they are integral to connecting our residents, who commute daily,” Mashaba said.
