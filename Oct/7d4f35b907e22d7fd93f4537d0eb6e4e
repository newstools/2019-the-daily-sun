TSHEPISO Mphumela couldn’t wait to give birth to her second child last month. But two days after her son was born, she was found hanging in the toilet at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. Her family believe, the 27-year-old from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, didn’t take her own life as the hospital claimed. Her father-in-law, Vusumuzi Mbatha (52), said he believes Tshepiso was murdered while her sister-in-law, Snenhlanhla (22), said there were no signs she was suicidal. They said shortly before her death, Tshepiso sent them SMSes saying she was being treated badly. “She even asked the doctor to discharge her. The doctor wrote down her complaint and signed it, but later refused to let her leave,” said Vusumuzi. “She said the nurses wanted to give her an overdose because she was difficult.” The family said there was nothing that could have made Tshepiso depressed. “She had support from us and her partner. She was studying teaching at Unisa and looked forward to becoming a teacher,” said Vusumuzi. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said the incident was being investigated by the police, and an inquest docket was opened. She said the family was welcome to open a criminal case.
