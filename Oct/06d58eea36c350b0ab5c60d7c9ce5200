ORLANDO Pirates interim coach Rhulani Mokwena has once again pleaded with Bucs faithful to keep supporting the team. Pirates’ dismal Absa Premiership campaign so far continued after they were beaten 1-0 by newbies Stellenbosch FC at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. The defeat left Bucs languishing in an unfamiliar position – tenth place with nine points from eight matches. The loss appeared to have hit Mokwena hard as he struggled to give his post-match thoughts. Speaking to SuperSport TV after the match, Mokwena said: “Congratulations to Stellenbosch, we go back to work, that's all we can do.” When pushed further to explain his side’s performance, a visibly dejected Mokwena continued: “Stellenbosch won the game and Stellenbosch deserved to win the game and congratulations to Stellenbosch.” He then asked the Bucs fans to stick by the team in this difficult time. Added Mokwena : "To the Pirates fans they must just keep on supporting their players, keep supporting their team, the team loves them, they love the team but you have to be gracious in defeat and accept that 23 shots at goal, 70 percent almost possession, doesn't win you games. Congratulations to Stellenbosch.”
