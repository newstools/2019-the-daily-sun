MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane believes Khama Billiat will be the biggest threat to his team when they face Kaizer Chiefs. The two title rivals will lock horns in a top o the table clash at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). Billiat has previously proven how devastating he can be against his former team. He along with another former Downs star, Leonardo Castro, were the stars of the show when Chiefs defeated the Tshwane giants 4-2 in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup. Mosimane is expecting Billiat to be e menace once again on Sunday. “Khama knows the secrets, we’ve created a monster out of him. We’ve taught him all the runs and all those things he’s doing now,” said Mosimane. “It reminds me when Pep took Bayern Munich to go and play Champions League against Barcelona, when he came back from his sabbatical and he got six [6-0 defeat] in Camp Nou. And who was the menace? Lionel Messi – the guy who he worked with all the time. “But because you have created that monster out of a talented human being – Khama is talented more than what we have helped him – he will still give you a problem and you can’t manage it. So, we have to do what we have to do to minimise his threat. You can’t stop him; you can only minimise. “He poses a big threat, more than anybody to be honest, because he’s scoring goals. That why we like him.”
