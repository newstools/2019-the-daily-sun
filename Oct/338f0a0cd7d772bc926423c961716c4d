THE late kwaito singing sensation Lebo Mathosa has finally been found. And she’s been found in actress and singer KB Motsilanyane, insiders said. This as singer Kelly Khumalo will allegedly no longer play the late pop star in the upcoming biopic, The Lebo Mathosa Story. The auditions to play Lebo took place earlier this year and Kelly bagged the role. But insiders claimed the producers replaced her with the 7de Laan actress because she was being a diva. Said the insider: “The movie is scheduled for release next year and production has to move fast. “Kelly was being a diva, and this is the reason they opted for KB.” According to the second source, Kelly had begun shooting the movie. “Production had already started, but they had to stop it because they decided to discontinue their relationship with Kelly,” the informant said. “This means the release date must be delayed to allow KB ample time to shoot.” The six-part series produced by Ochre Media is scheduled for release early next year. It will be aired on BET (DStv channel 129). The third source said KB had accepted the role. “She’ll start shooting soon and is excited to play Lebo,” the source said. “KB’s happy to play Lebo and feels highly honoured to be entrusted with such a huge responsibility. She was informed recently that she’d play Lebo Mathosa.” Efforts to reach both KB and Kelly drew a blank. Their phones rang unanswered and had not responded to the SunTeam’s WhatsApp messages and SMSes. BET had promised to respond to the SunTeam’s questions, but had not done so by the time of going to print.
