KAIZER CHIEFS are happy to continue playing in Durban and have agreed to extend their three-year deal with eThekwini Municipality. The deal allows Amakhosi to play some of their home games at the Moses Mabhida Stadium next season. Chiefs are in the final leg of their three-year deal with the city. Bidvest Wits have also struck a deal with the municipality until the end of the season. They are set to “host” Mamelodi Sundowns on 17 December and Chiefs on 24 April 2020. Sjabulile Ntuli, Moses Mabhida Stadium acting manager, said: “Chiefs and ourselves have agreed to renew a contract of three years. “They’ll play their home games at the venue next season.” Amakhosi have already played one league match this season, which was a success – on the field and commercially. They beat Black Leopards 1-0 on 10 August, as close to 20 000 fans flocked to the 2010 World Cup venue. which is way better than what they normal get at FNB Stadium. Ernst Middendorp’s side are set to “host” Bloemfontein Celtic on 7 December and the next fixture will be on 12 April 2020 at the venue. If they progress further in the Telkom Knockout and Nedbank Cup and are drawn at home, Chiefs will play those cup matches also at the venue. Last season, Chiefs played a total of seven games, including the Soweto Derby against Orlando Pirates in the TKO semi-final, where they lost 2-1 on 24 November last year. Wits’ deal is that they will pay for flights, accommodation and also the team they bring down to the coastal city. But they equally share the gate-takings. Although Wits coach Gavin Hunt isn’t happy on the football side to play at the venue since it gives the so-called big teams advantage, financially they will reap the financial rewards. The stadium manager added there was a possibility that the team from Braamfontein, Jozi, will revisit the deal for next season as their appraisal was good after the Pirates match.
