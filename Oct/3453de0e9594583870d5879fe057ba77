FORMER Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas has revealed that he would “love” to return to the PSL in the near future. The Italian, who found the going tough at Amakhosi before ultimately losing his job, is ready to for another crack in Mzansi football to prove he still has what it takes to succeed. “Yeah sure. Why not? Of course, I’ll love to coach in the PSL again,” Solinas told SunSport when asked if he would consider any offers from PSL clubs. The 51-year-old, though, will be hoping for a happier time in the PSL, should he decide to return as his last stint was one to forget in Naturena. Solinas was in charge of 22 games in all competitions for Amakhosi, but only managed to win eight, lost seven and drew the other seven matches. Needless to say, the demanding Amakhosi faithful were happy to see the Italian’s back when the club eventually decided to show him the door in December last year. He was replaced by the familiar face of Ernst Middendorp, who tried to steady the ship. This season, the German tactician appears to have found the right formula as his side are currently perched atop the Absa Premiership table with 19 points from eight games, four points ahead of second-placed Bidvest Wits. And believe it or not, Solinas said he is “extremely” excited to see his former club doing well. “With me, there’s no problem. I’m very happy to see them playing so well,” added Solinas talking from his homeland yesterday. “I’m happy for Chiefs and also for Amakhosi fans. So I wish them all the best.” It is worth noting, though, that Solinas’ time in Mzansi, was not completely terrible as he did enjoy two successful spells in charge of Free State Stars. He showed good tactical nous to guide the side to a 12th place finish in the Premiership and also helped them reach the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup. In his last stint with Ea Lla Koto, Solinas helped them reach the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout.
