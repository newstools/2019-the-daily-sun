Mzansi has been urged to celebrate the #BokkeFriday in support of the Springboks' Rugby World Cup games. Now, with the whole nation behind them, the Springboks have managed to whip Canada 66-7 to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Rugby World Cup. While others wear their Springbok jerseys for #BokkeFriday, others have come up with creative ways to show their support. At Pick n Pay, they are now selling green Worsrolls to show support to the boys.
