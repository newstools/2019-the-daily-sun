NINE matrics were struck by lightning on Tuesday while preparing for their final exams. The eight girls and one boy from Mammoka Secondary school collapsed after the incident and were rushed to clinics for medical treatment. The pupils from Tiki-line Village in Ga-Malebogo, Limpopo, were with two teachers when the lightning struck. An 18-year-old who witnessed the incident told Daily Sun there was suddenly a huge bang and a bright light and then pupils started screaming. “We actually thought they would die but they started talking after a while,” the pupils said. Simon Seduma of the SGB said all the affected pupils were recovering.“I went to their homes with the principal to check on them. They are fine and we are expecting them back at school after they receive counselling,” he said. “It’s the first time in our village that something like this has happened. We are shocked, but happy everyone survived.” Maphuti Ngoepe, a member of the SGB at nearby Potokela Primary School, said the school’s roof was blown off on the same day. “The block was just refurbished. We have spent more than R70 000 on it but it’s a natural disaster and we can’t blame anyone,” she said. Limpopo education department spokesman, Sam Makondo said social workers would be sent to the high school to provide counselling. “We wish the victims a speedy recovery while the neighbouring primary school will be assessed by a team from the disaster management department for repair,” Makondo said.
