In partnership with the PSL, the Diski Challenge is a football development programme that reaches out to more than 500 aspiring footballers each year. With two football competitions, a reserve league and a knock-out competition for the reserve teams of the PSL clubs, the MDC aims to fast track the development of young players into the PSL. This exciting initiative is in its sixth season and is growing in popularity. More than half a million fans have enjoyed world-class football at the festivals since the initiative began in 2014. All the Diski Challenge matches – which have doubled this year from 120 to 240 – are played in the kasis and are accessible to all the enthusiastic soccer fans. “As a significant investor in the development of sport in South Africa, the MultiChoice Group is proud of its involvement in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge,” said Joe Heshu, corporate affairs executive at MultiChoice Group. “We play a role in empowering the sports and entertainment supply chain through our investments in infrastructure, technology and empowerment initiatives, which in turn supports the broader sports economy.”
