Former Jam
Alley presenter Vinolia Mashego is back with a bang! It’s been
over a decade since V Mash graced our small screen. And
now V Mash, who once
played Hilda on the popular soapie Generations,  is back on TV. And
her fanbase is growing after her new gig in Giyani: Land of Blood. She
plays Kwinana, a dejected divorcee who must pick up the pieces of a broken
life. This
 after her rich husband leaves her for their domestic worker. V Mash’s
character is not far from her real-life story. She’s had her own fair share of
snags, which resulted in a battle with depression. But the
56-year-old has placed the dark days behind
her. Now, her focus is on her bright future. “I’m better
now. I’ve been getting jobs and have my own house,” she said.
