 KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says they are working hard and progressing in a bid to give chairman Kaizer Motaung an honorable 75th birthday present. Motaung senior was outside the country as he could not celebrate his day with the Amakhosi family. Said Middendorp: "The chairman is getting his 75th birthday today knowing where  he has been probably three months before he got to this birthday. It’s not only about a wish on his honorable day, but something where each an everybody could bring the club back to a certain level (win trophies). I think what we have seen in the past four months and probably to get more progress can send (a present) to somebody (Kaizer) who has done a fantastic job to this brand for the past 50 years. I hope he will have a good use of this fantastic day somewhere in the world."
