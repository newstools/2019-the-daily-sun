A MAN was bust after he allegedly killed his girlfriend’s mum with a panga. This happened at Justicia Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Tuesday. The suspect was allegedly dumped by his girlfriend.  He then went to her house and accused her mum of interfering in their relationship. The 74-year-old gogo was watching TV with her daughter when she was attacked. GIRLFRIEND KILLED FOR KNOCKING A neighbour said they were woken up by a woman screaming for help. When they went to investigate, they found the gogo lying in a pool of blood, her head separated from the body. Calcutta cops spokeswoman Sergeant Zanele Sibuyi said a 30-year-old man was arrested. “The gogo was declared dead on the scene by paramedics,” said Sibuyi. The Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court heard yesterday that the girlfriend, aged 28, was in hospital. She was allegedly attacked with the same panga that killed her mum. Magistrate Thembi Nyambi postponed the matter to 6 November for a formal bail application.
