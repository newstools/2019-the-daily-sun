RESIDENTS want the remaining part of the R61 road between Mthatha and Ngcobo to be urgently completed. They said the road has growing potholes.  Construction of the road started in 2015 and is a Sanral project. According to the agency, the total cost of the project will be R786 million, of which R544 million has been spent to date. Feziwe Samela from Dresini Village (54) uses the road when he visits Mthatha. “This road is a nightmare for us. It’s not good that we have to travel on such a bad road. We’re not safe. No work has been done since last year,” she said. Ayanda Tuswa, who drives from Mthatha to Bhaziya Clinic every day to work, said he was forced to change his tyres regularly. “I have to change my tyres every second month, especially the back ones. “I wish someone could do something about this road,” he said.

I’ve had two tyre punctures in one trip. “It’s costly for us. We’re taxpayers yet there’s no accountability from government,” he said. Sanral regional manager Mbulelo Peterson said construction of the road stopped when the contractor experienced financial difficulties. “They couldn’t continue with the work on site as the business rescue practitioner explored means to get the project completed. “The agency is engaging the practitioner with a view of finding a speedy resolution to this matter,” he said.
