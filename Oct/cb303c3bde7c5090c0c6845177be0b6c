HIS organisation lost the SRC elections to the EFF Student Command, but the former Sasco president didn’t accept defeat. On Saturday he and two other suspects allegedly stabbed three students and a lecturer, all of whom are EFF supporters. The lecturer and two of the students were discharged from hospital, while the third student is still in critical condition. The incident took place at the University of Limpopo. New SRC president Nichodimas Mojela said the scuffle broke out last Monday when Sasco members disrupted SRC programmes. “The suspect made threats on social media that there would be a fight on Saturday. Indeed, he attacked our members on the day.” Mojela said the EFF Student Command had won the elections fairly with 11 seats. Registrar Prof Kwena Masha said: “We have strengthened security where EFF Student Command leaders live to ensure they are safe. The main suspect in this matter is also a student here.” Billy Pillay, provincial Sasco chairman, condemned the violence. He said the actions of the suspects were disappointing. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said only one of the students opened a case of assault after he was stabbed with a sharp object. “The victim was rushed to hospital for medical attention. The suspect has not yet been arrested and is still at large,” he said.
