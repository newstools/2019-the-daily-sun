A Russian man has filed a lawsuit against Apple for moral
harm claiming that an iPhone app had turned him gay, according to a copy of the
complaint seen by AFP.  The man filed suit in a Moscow court asking for one million
rubles ($15 000) after an incident this summer in which a cryptocurrency called
"GayCoin" was delivered via a smartphone app, rather than the Bitcoin
he had ordered.  His lawyer Sapizhat Gusnieva insisted the case was
"serious", telling AFP that her client was "scared, he
suffered".  The GayCoin cryptocurrency arrived with a note saying,
"Don't judge until you try", according to the complaint.  "I thought, in truth, how can I judge something without
trying? I decided to try same-sex relationships," the complainant wrote.  "Now I have a boyfriend and I do not know how to
explain this to my parents... my life has been changed for the worse and will
never become normal again," he added.  "Apple pushed me towards homosexuality through
manipulation. The changes have caused me moral and mental harm."  Apple's representatives in Russia did not immediately
respond to AFP's request for comment.  Gusnieva said the US technology giant "has a
responsibility for their programmes" despite the alleged exchange taking
place on a third-party app.  The suit was filed on September 20 and the court will hear
the complaint on October 17, according to information on its website.  Homophobia is widespread in Russia where reports of rights
violations and attacks on LGBT people are common, though there are gay scenes
in major cities.  Moscow in 2013 introduced a law against "gay
propaganda", which officially bans the "promotion of non-traditional
lifestyles to minors" but in effect outlaws LGBT activism.  https://www.news24.com/World/News/russian-man-sues-apple-for-turning-him-gay-20191003
