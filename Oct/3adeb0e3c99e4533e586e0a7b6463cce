JMPD impounded three trucks from Matholesville which were used for illegal miners. Mathapelo Molapo told Daily Sun that she has been unemployed for eight years and she’s now looking for any new way of feeding her kids. She said at first, she was against illegal mining but now she can see that they’re just trying to make a living. “Maybe you should just make them legal or get them jobs. They’re just trying to feed their families,” she said. Moses Mabena (41) said he was once a Zama Zama and he still misses how much he used to make.He said he stopped because his wife was against it. “Yes I was putting my life at risk but at least I used to send decent money home. Now I come with peanuts and I can’t even quit my job because of how scarce jobs are,” he said. Nomgcibelo Mbatha (39) said even though she’s completely against illegal mining, she’s suggesting that if the mine is far from residents, those miners should be left alone. “Yes it’s wrong but there are no jobs. At the end of the day, kids need to have food before they sleep. Just remove illegal miners from places filled with people,” said Nomgcibelo. Daily sun spoke to the JMPD spokesman, Superintendent Wayne Minnaar who said they will have to pay R3200 per truck to get their trucks back. “One truck was impounded from Ontdekkers Road and CR Swart Road for putting up illegal posters (penis enlargement),” said Minnaar. “The owner of this truck will also have to pay R3200 impounding fee to get his truck back,” he added.
