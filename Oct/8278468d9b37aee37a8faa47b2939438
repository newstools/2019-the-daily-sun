 Two weeks ago, Isibaya actress Jessica Nkosi found herself topping the trend list on Twitter after posting about her baby daddy TK Dlamini, who allegedly cheated on her. While some followers sympathised with her, some gave props to TK after seeing the picture of the lady he is apparently cheating with. Earlier today the star tweeted that God has been good to her. She wrote: "Whooo Shem Lalelanike Umuhle Ujesu...That's it That's it". Following her tweet, some of her followers commented on the comment section with some give her words of encouragements, celebrating with her and some poking fun at her about what happened with her baby daddy but, she insisted that she will "block anyone" who comments rubbish on her Twitter.
