LEGENDARY jazz singer Don Laka has gone international. This comes after the 60-year-old signed a deal with an American record company called Cultures of Soul to re-release his albums. Don said he was first approached by a man called Jeff Swallom from Los Angeles four years ago about the matter, but he thought it was a scam.  “When Jeff approached me, he told me there was a huge demand for my songs overseas. I wasn’t interested because I thought they were trying to play me,” he said. “A year after I rejected the offer, Jeff approached me again and said an American sitcom, Master of None wanted to use my songs and a few weeks later, he showed me proof. That was when I realised he was legit and I agreed to work with him.” READ: NEWSREADER DIES AGED 42!
