Northern Ireland camp
Monkstown boxing gym has joined forces with the East London boxing promotions
LastBorn Promotions to plough back to Eastern Cape communities. Their partnership aims
to ignite change and positively impact the Eastern Cape community by providing
a renewed sense of hope. Two camps met in 2017 when Zolani Tete was in Belfast
for his WBO bantamweight title defence against countryman Siboniso Gonya. Tete
set his pre-fight camp at Monkstown Boxing Gym, now the Irish camp is in the
country to lend a helping hand. A delegation of nine people
made donations to two Mthatha orphanages that are adopted by LastBorn
Promotions and also have given boxing equipments to Mdantsane gyms. Monkstown gym provided
the pre-fight training camp for his WBO title defence against Siboniso Gonya. Director at Monkstown
gym Paul Johnston said apart from giving back to the Eastern Cape communities, they
also to give young people from Belfast an opportunity to learn about the history of Nelson
Mandela and the great boxing tradition in the Eastern Cape. “We offered the hand of
friendship to Tete and his team to train at our gym and we had a wider vision
to develop a partnership to bring young leaders from Belfast to Mthatha and
East London. We gave them opportunity to experience the great country South
Africa is and meet some of its great leaders," said Paul Johnston. According to Johnston
they have raised money to bring their youth leaders in Mzansi and also
contributed to various organisations they visited. “This partnership is part of
our social responsibility to those less fortunate than us,” he said. Tete’s manager Mlandeli
Theng’imfene is hoping their working relationship with Monkstown to continue
growing so that they even take SA youth to Ireland for leadership and skills
development.
