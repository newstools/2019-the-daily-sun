THE thought of being knocked out of the Telkom Knockout must be a thing of the past for Black Leopards players, according to coach Luc Eymael. He believes that their focus should be on their Absa Premiership campaign where they have been struggling – four losses, two draws and two wins – which leaves them 13th on the table. Lidoda Duvha lost 6-5 on penalties to Highlands Park in the Z’khipha More Goals first round in Tembisa on Sunday, a result that disappointed Eymael. The teams drew goalless at full-time. Said Eymael: “Yes, I am disappointed that we could not finish off the game before extra time. We had a chance one-on-one (Mwape Musonda’s shot hit Given Msimango’s hand) and the penalty was not given.” However, the Belgian mentor lashed out at his right-back Khuliso Mudau who was sent-off by referee Luxolo Badi on the stroke of full-time for a rough tackle on Highlands midfielder Ricardo Williams. Mudau will now miss a league clash against SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Friday (8pm). “It was not a good reaction for any player to make a tackle like that. He deserves a red-card,” he said. Eymael said they will take the positives from the match to ensure they overcome Matsatsantsa a Pitori to improve their position on the league table. “We showed a lot of fighting spirit and bravery. The league is tight and competitive like in Egypt. You can quickly get up the table and quickly go down. “We need to bounce back, we have two tough games as we will also face Cape Town City (9 November). We have only four days to prepare and I will give others a chance to refresh since they played under the heat on Sunday. We will work on their mentality to ensure they are ready.” The good news for Lidoda Duvha fans is that key players Thabo Matlaba, Robert Ng’ambi, Mogakolodi Ngele are available for selection following injuries, while latest recruits Edwin Gyimah and Thobani Mncwango are expected to make their debut on Friday.
