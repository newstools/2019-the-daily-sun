SELBY Mathebula will remain in jail until next month after he was denied bail by the Mhala Magistrates Court on Friday. The taxi driver (37) is facing assault and attempted murder charges. He attacked a madala in his late 60s when the madala tried to stop a fight between Mathebula and another taximan. They were fighting over passengers in Merry Pebble Stream Village on 30 September. The investigating officer told the court Mathebula, used a stick to beat the madala. He sustained head injuries and has since been admitted to Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela. Mathebula from Ka Masuku Village, near Thulamahashe, wasn’t asked to plead on both charges. He told the court he wouldn’t interfere with the state witness and his family depended on him for survival. “After I heard that cops were looking for me, I handed myself in. “I’m not a flight risk,” he told the court. The state warned him that a murder charge could be added if the victim were to die. A statement from investigating officer Ngobeni says the victim is being treated in ICU. Lawyer Eric Mashele asked the court to grant his client bail, on condition that he reports at Mhala cop shop once a week. But Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba said the accused didn’t show any valid reasons to be a suitable candidate for bail. She refused him bail and postponed the case to 5 November.
