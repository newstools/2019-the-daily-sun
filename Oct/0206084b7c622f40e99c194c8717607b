WHEN Ncedo Mzima’s girlfriend left him, not only did she leave behind their four-year-old kid, but also took the Sassa card with her. Ncedo (40) from Delft told the SunTeam his girlfriend went to live in Strand, near Cape Town. “I do everything for the child and I don’t have a problem with that. “As a father, it’s my duty to look after my child,” he said.  Ncedo said she left him while he was at work. “I came home to find the child alone in the house, and there was a letter on the bed. She said in the letter she couldn’t stay with me any longer but gave no reason. “She even said she wouldn’t be looking after the child,” he said. “She said she’d bring the card as soon as she gets her house sorted out, but she hasn’t done so.” He understood she probably didn’t have an income.  “But it’s been three years. She’s harming the child and this must end,” Ncedo said. Sassa spokeswoman in Cape Town Shivani Wahab confirmed that Ncedo’s ex was receiving the grant. “He’ll have to go to a police charge office and complete an affidavit stating that the mother is getting the grant money, but is not using it for the child and he’s the primary caregiver,” she said. “The affidavit must then be handed to a Sassa office, where he will lodge a complaint.” Efforts to speak to the woman were fruitless as her cellphone went to voicemail.
