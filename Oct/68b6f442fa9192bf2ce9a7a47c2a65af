SOUTH African long-jump star, Luvo Manyonga, who relinquished his long jump world crown at the IAAF World Championships in Doha, Qatar to finish fourth he is happy to have completed his "healthy". "That's the most important thing for me because I had a little niggle in my ankle. I made it through the season, so I just want to go back home and celebrate the position I got," he said at OR Tambo Airport on Monday when Team SA returned from the World Championships empty hande. “The season was long but I made it through and it's a blessing to have made it to the competition and see so many South Africans in the crowd. I can't change what happened. I just need to look forward to the future and come back strong." Zeney van der Walt, world youth and world U20 champion, who ended 6th in the women’s 400m hurdles said this was her "first senior worlds". "I had a lot to learn out of it," Van der Walt said. "The lesson learnt will help me prepare as I focus to the future at this level. I’m now off-season and looking at resuming for the new season around November with the aim of making the Olympic team to Tokyo next year.” It just unfortunate that Team SA came back without any medals to show from the 10-day war, arriving at the airport to a low key reception of family members, onlookers and admirers. Athletics SA (ASA) president, Aleck Skhosana, said: "Like the rest of the country, we are not happy we didn’t bring back any medals, but we will look into all aspects of our participation in this championship in order to move forward.”
