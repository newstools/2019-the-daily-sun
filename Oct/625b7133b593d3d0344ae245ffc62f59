THE deaths of two 17-year-old girls within two days of each other have left the community of Blydeville in Lichtenburg, North West, fuming and terrified. On Sunday, the body of Lenah Tselanyane was found with stab wounds. On Tuesday Ikgomotse Mokhutswane’s body was found next to the nearby river. CPF’s Sophy Matlakala said: “We find bodies but we don’t find the killers. This can’t carry on.” Lenah was in grade 11 at JM Lekgetha Secondary School. Her brother, Kealogetswe Moeng, said she sustained stab wounds in the stomach. Her arm was broken. “You can see she was fighting the person who killed her,” he said.  Lenah left home for school last Wednesday and never returned home. North West police’s Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said cops had opened an inquest docket in connection with Ikgomotse’s death.  Funani said the cops had opened a murder docket with regards to Lenah’s death. No arrests have been made. Education spokesman Elias Malindi said the deaths were saddening. An inquest docket has been opened and a murder case is being investigated.
