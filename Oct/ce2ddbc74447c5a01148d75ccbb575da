BIG changes are coming to the red party ahead of its December elective conference. According to the Citizen, a report from the Sunday World said that Adv Dali Mpofu and Godrich Gardee will be replaced in the executive of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).

The elective conference is to take place in mid-December in Nasrec, Joburg, according to party leader Julius Malema They added that EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee will be replaced by EFF MP Marshall Dlamini.
