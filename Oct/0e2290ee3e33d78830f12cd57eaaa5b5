FORMER SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni’s case was postponed to 25 November after she failed to appear in court for the fourth time yesterday. Myeni failed to arrive in the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane for three previous court dates, claiming she couldn’t afford to travel from KZN. Outa and the SAA Pilots’ Association have asked the court to declare Myeni a delinquent director, claiming she pushed dodgy deals at the airline, which added to its financial problems. Myeni’s lawyer, Nqaba Buthelezi, wants the SAA board that served with Myeni to join the case. He told the court he would be bringing an application to bring this about. According to Outa, SAA lost over R16 billion under Myeni.
