IN AUGUST 1956, women of all races marched to the Union Buildings to protest against pass laws. And Mbuti Moleba (72) remembered her mum, Martha, being among the women who walked to Tshwane from East Lynne during the march. On Saturday, the ANC threw a huge 100th birthday bash for gogo Martha at her home in Mamelodi West, Tshwane. The ANC Women’s League, led by Gogo Ndlovana, attended and thanked her for her brave stand. The party could have been mistaken for an ANC rally as most guests wore party regalia. Asked about the historic march, gogo Martha said she worked hard as a hawker and cops made her life difficult. She said she protested for things to get better. Over her long life, the gogo had nine kids, 35 grandchildren, 72 great-grandkids and 28 great-great-grandchildren. “I never worked for anyone in my life. “I supported all my children and grandchildren by selling scones, snuff and mageu,” she said. The gogo said she attended a mission school until grade seven. She said she believed she had been gifted with such a long life because she prayed. “I’m a born-again Christian. My life is centred on prayer. That’s why I’m still this strong. I never drank beer or smoked. I love traditional food and chicken,” she said. Her daughter Onicca (72) said the gogo was loved by everyone. “My mum’s a fearless woman of God. When we have problems she prays for us.”
