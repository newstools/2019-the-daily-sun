THE trial in the North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane against Dumi Masilela’s alleged killers was yesterday postponed to today. Masilela was shot in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, in 2017 by men in a black Jeep during a hijacking. He died in hospital. On Wednesday, accused Bongani Masombuka (34) alleged that Ivory Park cops beat him with a firearm and other objects to make him confess.  On Tuesday, Colonel Mhlanganyelwa Mbotho told the court Masombuka informed him he was aware of his rights and wanted to make a confession. However, his lawyer Walter Ranapole said injuries to Masombuka’s hands, feet, legs and ears showed he had been assaulted. Masombuka alleged he was given a list of names by the police after his arrest, and told to say they had committed the crime with him.
