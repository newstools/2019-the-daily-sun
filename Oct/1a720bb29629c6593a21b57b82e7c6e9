 Singer and dancer Dr Malinga is trending for all the wrong reasons. Last night he posted a video of a headless man that turned Twitter upside down. The man who looks like a hotel waiter is seen wearing a black and white uniform, walking very fast in the hotel corridor while holding a tray in his hands as if he is going to deliver something. Tweeps were left questioning whether this was a publicity stunt or a real thing that took place. Some even confessed to being scared of going to bed because they might be haunted by the headless man in their dreams. Malinga has not said anything about the video since posting last night. Maybe he is preparing himself for Halloween, which is this Thursday.  That #HeadlessMan video from the @drmalinga is going to give me nightmares yaz pic.twitter.com/EtTG6sy8MZ
