THE sight of Cheslin Kolbe back going through the paces with the Springboks has certainly brought a huge sigh of relief to the Boks followers. The pocket rocket has recovered from an ankle injury in time for the World Cup quarterfinals battle with Japan in Tokyo on Sunday (12.15pm). And the speedy winger is back in the line-up ready to terrorise the Japanese right in their own backyard as South Africa seek passage to the semifinals. ”I love to have the ball in general play and having one-on-one opportunities within a game and create as many opportunities not for myself but players around me. I'll make sure I keep having fun,” said Kolbe. “Dynamites come in small packages, you know. We all have something special to contribute to our various teams.” Just as Boks assistant coach Mzwandile Sticks has cautioned, Kolbe has also warned against underestimating dynamic Japan wingers, Kenki Fukuoka and Korato Matsushima. The duo has been credited with the Brave Blossoms’ progress to the last-eight round, having beaten the likes of Ireland and Scotland in the pool matches.“Both the Japan wingers are currently playing really phenomenal rugby. They've been on good form,” the 25-year-old added.“ Fukuoka is a very good player. He a got a lot of speed, really powerful and explosive and is really a good all-rounder. Kotaro loves to run with the ball, and just has a lot of freedom.” Stick said of Kolbe: “We know what Cheslin can bring on the field, and the special player he is. “Playing against the host nation, we know they are going to be playing with a lot of passion, and the supporters are going to be behind them.”
