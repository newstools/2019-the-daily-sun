For decades Korean car manufactures were taken for granted. Not so long-ago Hyundai released a high-performance version of its I30, the N which stands for ‘Namyang’. Now, as though thrashing the Golf GTI on a drag race wasn’t enough, Hyundai Australia has made a special one-off custom creation. Wait for it… Yes, Hyundai has created a very powerful version of its H-1 bus. Dubbed the iMax N ‘Drift Bus’, it produces 300kW of power and 555Nm of torque. It’s a no brainer that the standard 2.5-litre CRDi powertrain wouldn’t produce that much power.  So, instead Hyundai engineers threw in a monster 3.5-litre twin-turbocharged V6 engine. The superior H-1 bus isn’t called the Drift Bus for nothing, it was made to exactly go sideways and breathing through a bi-modal exhaust ensures the Drift Bus sounds as good as it looks. For the power be transferred properly to the ground, the suspension was beefed up with electronically controlled dampers, while the brakes were also given an N performance upgrade. iMax N looks the part, with an N steering wheel and N sports front seats, with the rear two bench seat rows also trimmed in matching suede and leather. There’s one sad part about it though, the ‘Drift Bus’ is not a production model, nor is it road legal.
