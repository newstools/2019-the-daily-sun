GOLDEN Arrows coach Steve Komphela is furious with referee Jelly Chavani. Komphela said he felt “insulted and disrespected” by the referee after the club’s 1-0 win over Polokwane City in the Telkom Knockout last-16 at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday. According to Komphela, he was rubbed up the wrong way by the match official who asked him if he wanted the whistle and be in charge of the game. It was rare to see Komphela so furious throughout the game. His assistant Mandla Ncikazi had trouble calming him down. “They (referee and fourth official Philangenkosi Khumalo) were insulting me,” said Komphela. Komphela added: “I gave Mandla problems today (on Saturday) and I’m sure he’s tired, not only looking at the match, but managing me. Komphela then said: “When a foul happens, it is natural (as coaches) that we scream: ‘Hey foul’. But when he (Chavani) comes and says ‘Do you want the whistle?’ That’s shear arrogance.” For the first time in his coaching career, Komphela was brandished with a yellow card. He continued: “I cannot accept arrogance. Arrogance is disrespectful. We have interacted with top referees with the utmost respect. You can’t come here and bully us.” The victory over Rise and Shine saw Arrows progress to the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2015-16 season. In the past three seasons they have been knocked out in the first round.
