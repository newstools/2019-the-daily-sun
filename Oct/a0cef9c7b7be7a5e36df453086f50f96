The Annual Feather Awards took place last night at 1 Fox Junction, Newtown in Joburg and the fashion was to say the least disappointing. The Feather Awards are dedicated to celebrating the LGBTIQA+ community through the arts. This year, some stars looked like they didn't even make an effort and they just came to chill. HERE ARE THE BEST DRESSED: 1. Celeste Khumalo Femme . Dress by @frenchnavycouture (Like Wow!?)
