Gcina Mhlophe’s legacy lives on! One of the few great storytellers the country has produced, Gcina has had her work published across the world. Next Thursday, the eThekwini Library Services and the Department of Parks and Recreation will, in partnership with her NGO Gcinamasiko Arts and Heritage Trust, come together to honour her and celebrate her remarkable life. The celebrations, which coincide with her 61th birthday, will be held at the Bluff Showgrounds. Speaking to SunBuzz, Gcina said: “It’s very humbling. The fact that the event coincides with my birthday makes it even more meaningful. “Through storytelling I’ve travelled the world. I’ve motivated people, and I’ve also taught important lessons. “I know nothing else except storytelling.” The accomplished author said telling stories meant a lot to her. “I’m glad my efforts are being recognised while I’m still alive. I’m also glad that today we’re seeing more young people getting into the world of storytelling.” The event will predictably be dominated by storytelling. “We’ve invited other storytellers such as Thandi Swartbooi from Women Unite Cape Town, Bongiswa Kota from Freedom Park, Bavikile Ngema and Marla Gounden from India, to name but a few,” said Gcina. “We’ve also invited musicians we feel share the same interest as us. They include traditional instrumentalist Madala Kunene as well as Victor Sithole, Njabulo Shabalala and Umlazi Com-tech.” Some of the activities will include dance, book displays, indigenous music and other artistic forms that celebrate South Africa’s diverse cultural heritage.
