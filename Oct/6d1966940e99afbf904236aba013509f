GAUTENG Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku has literally hit the
ground running, much like a duck taking to water in his new role. Masuku was appointed to a department that has many problems
and always in the limelight for the wrong reasons. He’s aware of what he’s getting himself into. His passion
and work ethic were laid bare when Daily Sun sat down with him recently. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window. DR BANDILE MASUKU: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS UNDER THE UMBRELLA with Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku, hosted by Simon Nare. Being a doctor himself, he told us what he’s learnt from
nurses and doctors in his interactions with them.  Impressively, he sounds as if he has a plan to fix the
department and reduce long queues at hospitals such as Baragwanath. He argues that most patients who spend hours in queues at
hospitals should not even be there in the first place. Those people should be
at clinics and hospitals should be left to deal with seriously injured people He tells us he intends for clinics to operate 24 hours.  On the issue of nurses’ morale at hospitals, Masuku says
contrary to popular belief that this was due to low salaries, corruption at
higher levels dampens the nurses’ spirits. He also explains at length the benefits of the NHI, which he
says is being opposed by private companies as well as private hospitals because
they fear they’ll lose profits. Masuku says it’s actually the opposite. The Gauteng Department of Health might finally have someone
who understands what it needs. Only time will tell.
