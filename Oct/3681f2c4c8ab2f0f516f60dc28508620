REJUVENATED Maritzburg United continued their resurgence in the Absa Premiership. The Team of Choice registered their second win on the trot after edging Baroka FC 1-0 at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Tuesday. Mxolisi Kunene grabbed the only goal of the match to hand Eric Tinkler’s charges all three points. Things appear to be looking up for Maritzburg after a rather disappointing start to the campaign which saw them pick up just two points in their first five matches. Their first win against Chippa United last week, looks to have provided the lift they needed. Their patience in Tinkler, who was under pressure to deliver a few weeks ago, seems to be paying off. He has managed to get the KwaZulu Natal outfit playing with the same vigour and determination that saw them cling on to their Premiership status in the latter part of last season. Meanwhile, things are not looking so great for Baroka who have now lost three matches on the spin. They have also failed to find the back of the net in their last two outings now, something that will worry Coach Wedson Nyirenda. Fortunately, the Zambian will have a bit of time to plot a way forward for his team with the international break around the corner. They face another KZN outfit, AmaZulu, in three weeks’ time hoping for a better day at the office. Maritzburg’s next opponents are Cape Town City, who are desperately searching for consistency.
