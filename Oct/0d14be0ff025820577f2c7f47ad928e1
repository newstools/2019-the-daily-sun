COUNCILLORS were shocked when news broke that Capricorn Mayor John Mpe sold the municipal car and bought a new one without consultation. Although he wasn’t allowed to buy a car worth more than R700 000, the Limpopo mayor apparently traded in an old BMW X5 and got a new one for R1,2 million. It has been reported that Mpe bought the car in June. The matter was first brought to light by DA Councillor Ngoako Setjie. “We demand to see the invoices for both the old and the new car, and the council resolution that allowed him to sell and buy another car,” said Setjie. Municipal spokesman Moffat Senyatsi said a report on the matter would be presented to the council today. “The council approved the budget. There’s no way the mayor can buy a new car without justification. The car that was traded in was beyond its lifespan,” he said. “It was going to cost the council more to maintain. A report will outline the reasons a car worth R1,2 million was bought.” EFF chairman in Limpopo Jossey Buthane said the mayor couldn’t take such decisions without consulting the council.
