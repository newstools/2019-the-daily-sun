THE ball is in the Ke Yona Team players‘ court now! The 18 young aspiring professional footballers were on Friday drafted to the 16 Absa Premiership clubs where they will spend a month’s trial. Nedbank Cup reigning champions TS Galaxy took two players. These players will be looking to impress PSL coaches and win professional contracts with Absa Premiership teams. It will be the fourth time players are drafted since the Ke Yona project started six years ago. In the past three drafts, only a few players managed to win professional deals with top-flight teams. One of the Ke Yona coaches, Khabo Zondo, who has been part of this initiative since it’s inception, said they are not forcing players down the throats of the PSL coaches. Zondo, however, explained that as Ke Yona coaches, they understand PSL coaches are facing serious challenges. And as a result, they end up not having enough time to asses the youngsters thoroughly as they can only spend a month with the teams. “From where I’m sitting it becomes difficult to know and understand what the PSL clubs do with these players,” Zondo said. “PSL are faced with challenges of winning the league and some trophies. They also have their development structures.”
