AN extra time own-goal has paved the passage for Golden Arrows to secure a 1-0 victory over Polokwane City at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The first half was a closely contested affair, and it took both teams a while to find their rhythm before the contest began to hot up after the 20-minute mark. Arrows tried their luck from range through Danny Phiri in the 23rd minute, but his speculative effort flew over the crossbar, while at the opposite end of the pitch, Mohammed Anas saw his goal-bound effort cleared off the line by Gladwin Shitolo. And, just moments before the half-hour mark, Arrows coach Steve Komphela received a booking after giving the referee a piece of his mind from the touchline. Polokwane were being forced to defend in the closing stages but Arrows were unable to breach their obstinate defence. And Arrows were nearly caught out just two minutes before the half-time break as keeper Edmore Sibanda had to be on his toes to keep out a Polokwane free-kick. Polokwane had one last chance to snatch a draw at the death to force a penalty shootout, but their free-kick attempt flew narrowly wide, much to the relief of the Arrows bench. The deadlock was finally broken in the closing stages of the first half of extra time, and Arrows received a big slice of luck as Nicholas Motloung deflected the ball into his own net after trying to block Mutizwa's shot on goal.
