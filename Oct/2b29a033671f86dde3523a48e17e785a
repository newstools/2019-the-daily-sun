MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says Kaizer Chiefs are benefitting from referees’ mistakes while they are not getting any joy from officials. Mosimane made this statement on Wednesday after his charges were denied a penalty by referee Cedric Muvhali when Leopards defender Khuliso Mudau held the ball inside the penalty box while trying to clear Lyle Lakay’s shot to safety. “The rules say you are in the box, your hand is up, he must blow. He’s gone with his own rules. I suffered twice with AJ (Andile Jali) against Bloemfontein Celtic and when it’s Chiefs it’s always a penalty. I must also get a penalty, Chiefs are benefiting from all mistakes of referees and I am not benefiting.” Mosimane was also not happy that Muvhali allowed a Leopards player to disobey his rules by getting back on the pitch without notifying him. “I disagree with him because a guy came out and went inside the pitch and he is the one who gets the ball, what is that? He must wait there (outside) for the referee to call him. He (Muvhali) says he called him, can he hear him with that noise?” However, Mosimane emphasised that he has nothing personal against Amakhosi. “It’s not about Chiefs, I am highlighting the realities. I like the ref, he is a good ref, a young one up and coming. He is good, but he chickened out.”
