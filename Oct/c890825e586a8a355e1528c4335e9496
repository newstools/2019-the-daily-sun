COPS in Gauteng have nabbed one of their own for
illegally selling application forms to aspirant police trainees. The police constable, from Florida Saps was nabbed on Monday
after the Anti-Corruption Investigating Unit (ACIU) was tipped off about the
corrupt activists. South African Police Services, recently announced the
opening of application for the 2020 intake of aspirant police trainees. The arrested constable allegedly demanded R2000 upfront
from prospective trainees wishing to join the South African Police Service. The total amount that the officer was charging is R3500,
which would be settled at the later stage. The suspect is expected to appear before the Roodepoort
Magistrate Court today, (16 October 2019) facing charges of corruption and
fraud. “The ACIU team operationalised the tip-off and, on the
afternoon of 14 October 2019 arrested the 39-year old suspect at a fast-foods
restaurant in Roodepoort after he was found in possession of the deposit that
had just been paid by a "victim" who was in on the crime prevention
operation,” Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said in statement. “Further investigations by the ACIU have confirmed that
three other victims have been scammed by the same police member”.
