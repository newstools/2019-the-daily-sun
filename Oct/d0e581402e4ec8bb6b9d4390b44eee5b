WHEN a contractor started installing water meters, they thought their days of drinking dirty river water would soon be just an ugly memory. That was in 2016 and residents from Maqonqo in Pietermaritzburg are still without clean water.  Resident Maria Mathonsi (72) said the district municipality was not helping. “We drink dirty water with the cattle,” said Maria. “We often find nappies and other rubbish in the water. But we have no choice but to remove the rubbish and use the water anyway.” Resident Ntombikayise Mthembu (57) said water meters and taps were installed but have never worked. “No water comes out. We hear the project was never completed,” said Ntombikayise. “Even when we find cow dung in the river, we still have to use the water.” READ: TUPAC IS IN JAIL! Resident Angelina Maphumulo (59) said pigs play in the water. “We wait for the mud to sink and take the water home,” she said. She said she isn’t strong enough to carry heavy objects anymore and her husband, who used to help with fetching water, was sick and bedridden. “I’m forced to go to the river despite my condition,” she said. “We want the district municipality to complete the water project. This is the only way we can have our dignity restored.” Ward councillor Nhlanhla Zondi confirmed there was a project that was not finished.

But the district has informed me they have solved the matter and work is expected to resume next week,” said Zondi. UMgungundlovu district spokesman Brian Zuma said: “A stakeholders’ meeting was held on 8 October. “The municipality, the contractor and engineering consultants are all committed to ensuring the project resumes as soon as possible.”
