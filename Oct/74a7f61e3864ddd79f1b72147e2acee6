SIFISO is bringing back the spark to people’s bedrooms, one bottle at a time. He’s doing this with his imbiza, “umbhed’uyajika”. Sifiso Mbatha (42), originally from Nquthu, KZN, claimed he’s not a sangoma, but his imbiza comes highly recommended. “Unlike my late dad Sosobala, a well-known sangoma who treated politicians and celebrities, I don’t have healing powers. But I have the ability to mix this imbiza, which has helped to revive a lot of households,” Sifiso said he started making it 15 years ago while he worked at a hotel in Jozi. “When the demand got high, I was forced to quit my job and focus on mass producing it. I’m the only one who mixes it the way I do. People who have drunk other stuff can confirm this.” Sifiso claimed celebrities such as Tbo Touch and Zodwa Wabantu were among his clients. “Tbo Touch is my biggest supporter and he buys in bulk. Zodwa too.” Zodwa said: “I know him but I don’t buy imbiza from him and never did.” When called, Tbo Touch said he knew the imbiza maker. “I normally go to the hostel to buy meat. I give him and business owners in the area money. But I don’t take their products, let alone imbiza.” Sifiso said he delivered the imbiza to hostels as people’s relationships depended on it. A woman from Nancefield Hostel in Soweto said she highly recommended the imbiza as it helped her fall pregnant. “I struggled to fall pregnant for some time, but umbhed’uyajika has changed my house into a warm home.” Another customer said he was a beast in bed because of the imbiza. “Our job as men is to satisfy our women and it helps me keep my woman satisfied. There are no quickies in my bedroom.” Sifiso sells small bottles for R20, while the big ones are R60.
