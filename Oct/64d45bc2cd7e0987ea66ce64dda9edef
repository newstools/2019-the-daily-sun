RESIDENTS of Stinkwater in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, took part in a fun run on Wednesday. Even the elderly took part in the fun walk, which was part of a climate change awareness campaign. Children and residents painted their faces and bodies to show respect for nature. Modilati Secondary School principal Sonnyboy Mpofu said the school organised fun runs covering 3km, 5km and 8km distances. Mpofu said more than 300 people from Atteridgeville and Mamelodi, and 800 pupils from Tshwane schools, took part. “We did it to make people aware that there’s no second planet earth. This is our only precious resource and we need to protect it at all costs.” Mpofu said participants shared various messages with pupils. “We feel great because we reached our community of Stinkwater and other communities around Tshwane.” He said they were planning to make it a yearly event. Representives of Mamelodi Sundowns, Old Mutual, Brain Waves, cops and teachers also participated. Former Sundowns legend Malombo Lechaba said: “It was nice seeing children playing with powder colours.” He wished the event could be held every week. “I told children sport is something that can change their lives, keep them healthy and unite people,” he said.
