 IT WAS in the early hours of Friday when residents near the railway line heard a loud bang. Nozibele Makonzi (36) told Daily Sun it sounded as if somebody had been shot. When residents of Hazeldene in Philippi Browns, Cape Town, went to investigate they found a man had been electrocuted during the night. His body was found hanging from the crossbar frame between Philippi Train Station and Nyanga Junction. The man, whose identity hadn’t yet been established, was believed to be a cable thief. He was killed while he was busy cutting overhead cables on the railway line. Nozibele said people stole cables all the time but usually got away with it. “The man didn’t know it was his last day on earth.” Nozibele said his death disrupted trains for a few hours on Friday morning. People arrived late to work because of this,” she said. Sindi Ntuntwana (41) said: “Look at the damage he’s done. He’s made life difficult for thousands of people so he can have some money. “Cable thieves are the most selfish people. We have to find other ways to get to work because of their stupidity.” Police spokesman Constable Siyabulela Malo said an inquest docket was opened for investigation after an unknown man was electrocuted while lying on the crossbar and cutting electric overhead cables on the railway line.
