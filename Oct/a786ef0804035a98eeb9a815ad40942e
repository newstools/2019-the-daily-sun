FOR over six years now, taxi commuters in Vereeniging, south of Joburg, have had no public transport. There were delays in the taxi rank redevelopment project, which led to an increase in crime and shops closing down. Gauteng Roads and Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo told Daily Sun the project would be fast-tracked.  “We’re going to build an intermodal transport system to compensate the loss people of Sedibeng suffered. “We’ve changed the scope from a mere taxi rank to a broader intermodal transport facility. “This is not a long-term thing. We’re going to do it right now and right away.” READ: FROM CASHIER TO OWNER! South African National Taxi Council spokesman Midday Mali said: “We were told it will take a year and a couple of months to complete. “However, we’ll give the newly elected delegation the benefit of the doubt, especially because Mamabolo is having follow-up meetings with us.” Mali said they hoped government would tell them their plans. Resident Lucia Ndoro (45) said: “We were happy when we were told about the rank. “We always see people getting robbed because we travel a long distance to get to the taxi rank. “We will be happy when the taxi rank is complete.”
