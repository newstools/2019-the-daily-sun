A senior lecturer at the University of South Africa (Unisa) has apologised for "embarrassing herself" after lashing out at National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) recipients at the institution on social media. On Wednesday, Tracey McKay told News24 she regretted her actions and apologised to everyone who had been harmed by her comments on Twitter. Mckay's tweets were in response to user Roman Cabanac who had asked how textbook sales could fall if NFSAS gave students R5 000 to spend on books. She tweeted she wished students were copying the books, saying she was sure the money was being used on "entertainment, wigs, nail polish and other student essentials". Mckay continued that "even before this cash payment, the students would buy the books and immediately sell them". She further tweeted she worked in academia, and the vast majority of students she had taught were the kind that bought wigs. Other Twitter users asked Unisa if Mckay's tweets were acceptable to the institution.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/i-didnt-mean-to-offend-anybody-unisa-lecturer-after-series-of-tweets-attacking-nsfas-recepients-20191030
