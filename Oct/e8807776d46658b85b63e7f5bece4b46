FORMER Cape Town mayor under the DA Patricia De Lille has come out guns blazing for Mmusi Maimane on his worst day. Soon after he announded stepping down as DA leader , De Lille released a statemement on her social media saying she warned Mmusi. De Lille had a messy breakup with the DA last October  which led her to start her own political party GOOD that contested in the national elections in May this year. "When I resigned from the DA on my own terms a year ago on 31 October 2018, it was after learning bitter lessons that the party’s stated policies were window-dressing not matched by its practises in government." "I hate to say I told you so but I am going to say it anyway. I am not claiming to be a sangoma but I warned Mmusi Maimane that if he didn’t stand on principle his party’s laptop boys would swallow him up and spit him out." "He saw the blue train coming but didn’t know how to get out of the way. The problem for Mmusi and his handlers in the DA is that none of them have a clue about principled leadership." "The DA is well on its way on the path of destruction, and it’s best we don’t disturb them. South Africans who care about all our people must continue to come together for common GOOD." "To Mmusi I say: GOOD bye, Im glad to see you go and hope you have a GOOD time." Maimane quit alongside longtime DA servant Athol Trollip. The two join Herman Mashaba who announced his resignation as Joburg mayor and as a DA member on Monday.
