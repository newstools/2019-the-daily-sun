TWO madalas have accused cops of stealing their livestock. Johannes Lebeko (56) said his livestock was allegedly taken in 2005, while Jacob Lenyora (63) lost his in 2015. The madalas from Ventersburg in the Free State said they won’t find peace until their livestock was returned. Johannes said a cop took his 24 cows and 135 sheep after he claimed the madala owed him money. He told Daily Sun: “He said I owed him R35 000 and I thought he was joking. I was shocked when I heard he took my livestock from the kraal.” He said he reported him at the cop shop, but nothing was done. Jacob said a cop came with a woman and told him she was the rightful owner of his pigs. “He then called other cops who came in a police van and took eight pigs,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “Two cases were opened after allegations of theft of animals were made.” He said the piglets were confiscated by the police and were not stolen. “The court decided DNA tests should be conducted on the piglets of the complainant and compared to those it was alleged were stolen. “The piglets were exhibits and kept in a pound,” he said. “But the results took long and keeping them in the pound was costing the state a lot of money, so they were sold. The money was forfeited to the state.” Makhele said DNA results proved the animals were not stolen, but belonged to the person they were confiscated from. “We advise the rightful owner to approach the court to state his case and claim the money back as the order was made by the court,” he said.
