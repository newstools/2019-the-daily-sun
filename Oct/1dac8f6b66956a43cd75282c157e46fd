A Mzansi woman who was bust in Mauritius last month for alleged drug smuggling was with her child at the time. According to the IOL site, the 34 year-old woman from KZN was arrested on September 15 with 528 grams of heroin, worth R8 million hidden in her punani. The site quotes Patricia Gerber‚ of advocacy organisation Locked Up in a Foreign Country who wrote on Facebook that the woman’s four year-old child is back in Mzansi while his mum faces an uncertain future.  "Dirco (Department of International Relations and Co-operation) in collaboration with Social Development and SAA brought the child of the girl in Mauritius safely home and he is now with his grandmother and family."  "A big thank you to Dirco, Social Development and SAA for bringing the little one safely home."  Last week the SunTeam had reported according to Lexpress.mu in Mauritius, the woman was allegedly promised R40 000 for delivery.  After being caught, she reportedly co-operated with the police, setting up an operation to deliver the drugs that resulted in the arrest of two more suspects, two Nigerian nationals. At the time Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesperson Lunga Ngqengelele had confirmed the incident but would not disclose details surrounding the arrest, saying it would be up to the family to speak about what happened.
