ORLANDO Pirates’ dismal form so far this season continues to be a cause for concern for their fans. Bucs struggles under interim coach Rhulani Mokwena seem to be persisting – leaving fans worried. Since taking over the reins following the sudden departure of Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic, Mokwena has only managed to mastermind two wins in nine matches. They occupy 10th spot on the Absa Premiership table with nine points from eight matches. They were also bundled out of the Caf Champions League and well as the MTN8. And their latest league defeat at the hands of Stellenbosch at the weekend appears to have cut deep. A number of supporters have taken to social media to voice their frustration with some questioning whether Mokwena has what it takes to lead the club to success. One of those who have their doubts is the former Minister of Sport Fikile Mbalula. Mbalula, who is now Minister of transport, is a staunch Bucs fan and he did not hold back on social media – suggesting Mokwena is not good enough to lead Bucs back to the top.  "Pirates don't have a coach," Mbalula said on Twitter.   "I looked forward to a great season for my team but I am afraid [it] is not about to happen, we are in denial. So many great players but no coach. "I have heard about this experiment. Pirates is a big club to experiment with history, it is our team we supported since we were kids. I support Rhulani Mokoena but for now, he is not equal to the task."
