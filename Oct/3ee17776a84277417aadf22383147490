IT’S back to square one for Orlando Pirates. Their problems this season have once again reared their ugly head. This after they fell to their third Absa Premiership defeat of the season at the hands of rookies Stellenbosch FC. Iqraam Rayners scored the only goal of the match to help Stellies to a 1-0 win over the Soweto giants at Cape Town Stadium. This was the second time the two sides met in the space of a week. They faced off last week in the last 16 of the Telkom Knockout - a match Pirates won 1-0 at the Orlando Stadium. However, Stellies have now got their revenge - edging Bucs to climb above them in the log standings. They are now ninth on the log with ten points after nine matches. This is a major improvement on their part having struggled in the early parts of the season. In fact, it took them four matches to register their first goal in the top flight, however, they look to be settling well now. "It is indescribable what we have achieved in such a short space of time," Stellies coach Steve Barker, who was proud of his troops, told SuperSportTV after the match "We fought hard, the legs were gone in the last few minutes but they kept fighting." Meanwhile, Polokwane City managed to snatch a point from the jaws of defeat against Golden Arrows at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in the other early match.
