MODERN-DAY parenting is a whole new ball game, compared to what past generations went through to raise kids. Children today have access to social media in the form of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, among other popular networking platforms. As much as technology is a great advancement for humans, it can also be destructive. This as not all things found in the internet are good – and can be damaging to a young mind that doesn’t know better. Emilar Gandhi, Facebook’s Southern African Development Community region head of public policy, shared tips on how to parent teens on social media. She said it was important for everyone to feel safe from bullying, harassment, scams, inappropriate content and other cyber dangers when using social media. Said Emilar: “We work with external experts, including a safety advisory board, to gather feedback from our community to develop policies, tools and resources to keep users safe online.” Below are Emilar’s tips to help parents with kids’ online safety: 1.

Facebook and Instagram require everyone to be 13 years old before they can create an account (in some countries, this age limit may be higher dependending on local laws). 2. Let your teen know the same rules apply online as offline. This way they can avoid potential dangers and concerns online by stopping to think before they submit a post or accepting a friend request. 3. esearch shows children as young as six have access to smartphones or tablets.
