Hey MizzB I’M a 24-year-old gay guy and three weeks ago a new guy came to our company. We became friends. He often checks on me and shows concern. I don’t hide my sexuality and have now developed romantic feelings for him. But I’m afraid of making the first move because I’m not sure if he shares the same feelings. Should I pursue him or let him come to me? - Brother Hey Brother Life is full of missed opportunities as we can be too afraid to take the first step. People should know our feelings so they can choose what and where they want to be. Protect yourself by leaving room for disappointment. When someone wants to be a part of your life, they’ll make their intentions clear. No matter how good a person you are, you’ll never be good enough for someone who’s not ready to be with you.
