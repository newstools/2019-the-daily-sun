THE festive season is upon us, and sangomas and churches prayed to prevent more bloodshed on the roads. They performed rituals while church members prayed on the Tonk Meter Road (M42) to Duduza in Ekurhuleni. The prayer meeting was attended by cops, Metro cops and MMC for transport in Ekurhuleni, Phelisa Nkonjane. Councillor Thabo Motaung said the aim was to seek divine intervention for the road. Sergeant Harry Manaka of Duduza Police Station said a high number of accidents were recorded on the road, especially during the festive season. Sangoma Zodwa Ndamase said the rituals were necessary as some families don’t fetch the spirits of their loved ones. Pastor Aletta Maseko said she believed in the power of prayer. “We hope work done today will yield results,” she said. Some motorists were happy something was being done on the deadly road. “Five years ago I lost a friend on this road. We hope this works,” said motorist Simon Dibeila. Another motorist, Nomasonto Vilakazi, said she didn’t believe in rituals. “We’ll wait and see,” she said.
