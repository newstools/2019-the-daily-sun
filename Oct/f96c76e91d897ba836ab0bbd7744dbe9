TSEPO Masilela’s contract is ready to be signed with AmaZulu, but the 34-year-old is believed to be stalling as negotiations with club bosses continue. According to AmaZulu coach Jozef Vukusic, the ball is in the former Kaizer Chiefs defender’s court if he wants to sign or not. Masilela has been training with Usuthu since last week and has impressed the former Polokwane City coach. “I think this week we will sign him (Masilela),” said Vukusic. “Masilela is a quality player and can add value to our team. He just needs to improve on his fitness, but he is coming right. It now depends on him if he agrees on his salary with the club. The decision is now on him and the club. So let’s wait and see if the negotiations with the club will go well.” The Witbank-born star has been without a team since he left Chiefs two season ago. Masilela is an experienced defender, who won two Absa Premiership titles with Amakhosi after spent six years with the Soweto giants. The veteran player has also played for Israeli giants Maccabi Haifa and La Liga outfit Getafe. The former Benoni player boasts 51 Bafana Bafana caps. On his side’s 1-0 victory against Baroka FC in a league clash on Sunday, Vukusic, who succeeded Cavin Johnson as AmaZulu coach, said: “I am satisfied with the performance and the points. We just need to continue collecting points and improve on our performance. I am proud of the commitment in the team.” AmaZulu are now second bottom on the log with eight points from nine league games. They are on the same number of points as Bloemfontein Celtic, Cape Town City and Baroka, who are above them on goal different. Usuthu host PSL rookies Stellenbosch FC in their next league match at King Zwelithini Stadium (7:30pm).
