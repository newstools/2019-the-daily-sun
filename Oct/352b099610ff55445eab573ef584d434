THE People’s Paper is not surprised that Dudu Myeni has missed yet another court appearance. SunReaders know that Myeni is a serial skipper, having on many occasions not pitched up to be held accountable to the country. Myeni, who sits on 13 different boards and is the head of the Jacob Zuma Foundation, claims she’s unemployed and too poor to make court. So we did some maths for her and discovered that if she caught a cab to King Shaka International Airport from Richard’s Bay where she lives, caught a plane to OR Tambo, and then hailed an Uber X, the round trip would cost her R3 366. And we also found her a place to stay – the SUN1 in Pretoria is near the High Court, and costs R595 a night. So two nights and a round trip home would cost about R5 000. Compared to the billions this wrecking ball cost the country, we don’t think it’s too much to ask.
