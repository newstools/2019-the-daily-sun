DJ Zinhle just announced that she will officially be opening her own Furniture store and that there will be a grand opening sale. Last year we saw DJ Zinhle share her amazing journey decorating her newly built home with exquisite unique peaces that she hand picked and had most of them made to suit her taste. The DJ hinted that she might go in to home decor and the wait is finally over. Zinhle is collaborating with her long time friend Brandon Reynolds for Jiyane Atelier and they will be launching the store this Friday. The excited mother of one broke the news with a video on Instagram and Twitter and titled it " After months of hard work, research and God, I am proud to announce that @jiyane_atelier launches this Friday... www.jiyanehome.com" After months of hard work, research and God, I am proud to announce that @jiyane_atelier launches this Friday... www.jiyanehome.com A post shared by  ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Oct 2, 2019 at 6:32am PDT  The website is already up with the tag line "Welcome to the home of contemporary and chic design.
