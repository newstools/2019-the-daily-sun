THE reason why Mamelodi Sundowns star Themba Zwane is excelling, is because of Kaizer Chiefs legend Doctor “16V” Khumalo’s influence in his life. Khumalo brags about the influential Brazilians’ talisman’s rich vein of form at the Tshwane giants. Zwane was instrumental in Bafana Bafana’s Nelson Mandela Challenge 2-1 victory over the Eagles of Mali at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Goals by Zwane and Dean Furman helped new coach Molefi Ntsiki to record his first game in charge of the senior national team. Khumalo says that Zwane always comes to him to seek advise on how he can improve his game. Said a boastful Khumalo: “Players from different teams call and I advise them on how to improve their game. Themba Zwane came to me to ask what is it that he can do to improve his game. "He needed to know what he must do to improve and become a better player. "I can’t deny Zwane the knowledge or the information that I’m supposed to share with him.” Khumalo claims that since their heart-to-heart talk, Zwane has become a better player than he was before. An excited Khumalo said: “Believe it or not, since then Zwane has become a better player than he was before.”
