Buying clothes costs a lot of money and having laundry day ruin them all the time is financial regression. Garments will either lose their shape, color or tear during the laundry process and changing or being mindful of what you do to your clothes might save you money and time. To protect your clothes, here are some tips to help you prevent laundry mistakes that will send your clothes from the closet to the bin. 1.Read Fabric Care Labels - this is the most important part but often times we choose to ignore it. If it says wash in cold water, then do just that. If the label says dry clean only, believe it—especially if the item is new. 2. Always Sort Your Laundry - When you put your clothes in the washing machine they have no choice but to mix with each other and that automatically to avoid zippers mixing with sensitive materials. Another benefit of sorting laundry correctly is that when it is time to use the dryer, one type of fabric will not be "cooked" while others are still quite damp when you select the correct drying temperature. 3. Use a Mesh Bag for Delicates - A mesh can save you so much money by protecting your delicate materials like lingerie and small miniature atems. 4. Button Up and Zip It - Buttoning, zipping or closing your garments helps them to be less likely to snag other fabrics or even snap themselves. Your clothing will also last longer if after you've buttoned them up, you turn them inside out. 5. Don't Overload the Washer - Overloading the washing machine with clothes may seem like the easy way to get more laundry done quickly, but it is harmful to your clothing. First, they don't get as clean and secondly, they rub together so much there is actual harm to the finish of your clothes.
