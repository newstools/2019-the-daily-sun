With smartphones and emoji, sexting has gotten to a whole new level where emoji that are used to represent foods by some innocent people are being used for sexual connotations. Facebook and Instagram have banned these two emoji, as well as the water drip, for being too ‘sexually suggestive.’ These three emoji represent a penis (aubergine), bum (peach), and ejaculation (water drip) and can no longer be used in a manner that suggests or asks for anything sexual. “People use Facebook to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation. We recognise the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. We draw the line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters between adults." Facebook explained. The change is part of an update to Facebook’s Sexual Solicitation Community Standards , which are aimed at sex workers who use the platforms to sell their services. “We also restrict sexually explicit language that may lead to solicitation because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and the broader community.” they said.
