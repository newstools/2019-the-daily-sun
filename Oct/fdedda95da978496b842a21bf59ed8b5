A Romanian Instagram model named Andrea reportedly makes about $2 million which is about R20 million annually from posting pictures of her bum. Andrea Abeli used to work as a web designer, but now shares snaps of her surgically-enhanced figure with more than three million followers despite the account being private. Mirror reports that Andrea makes about R8000 to roughly R76 000 a post.  “I am known for my honesty and not cutting corners,” said the model. She also added that she's very blunt about her plastic surgeries and her bio also read TEAM NOT NATURAL. The social-media expert says she’s also run a marketing agency since 2014, consulting with up-and-coming influencers who want to know how they can make it big on the photo-sharing platform.
