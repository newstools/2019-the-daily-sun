 The South
African National Defence Force (SANDF) was deployed to protest-hit Dunoon, Cape
Town, early on Tuesday morning not to stop protests, but to raid premises for
drugs and guns, Western Cape police said. "The
forces are focusing on the generators of crime such as drugs and firearms.
Please note, the deployments are not about the protest but generators of crime
in the area," said Captain FC van Wyk about the SANDF's support for the police's
Operation Lockdown mission. The SANDF's
mandate to stay in Cape Town to support the police was extended to March 2020.
It was not immediately clear whether it was meant to be limited to the Cape
Flats, but the troops have already assisted in an abalone raid in Table View. Van Wyk said
the mission targeted the Table View and Dunoon taxi ranks on Monday night,
adding it had continued on Tuesday morning. A later
statement said Milnerton police had also confiscated dagga worth around R10 000
from a 31-year-old foreign national at a salon. Dagga Dagga worth
around R10 000 was confiscated at a salon by Milnerton police. (Picture

the public order policing unit was deployed to maintain law and order amid
uncertainty over the protests as a small number of police and law enforcement
officers patrolled the area. Residents, who gathered on the litter-strewn roads on
Tuesday, waited for news on whether there would be any resolution to the
impasse that has kept the neighbourhood cut off from public transportation. MyCiTi buses were turning at ranks further down its route,
and motorists were reluctant to drive through due to sporadic stone throwing. A
truck transporting eggs was stopped, torched and looted on Monday. People have been walking long distances to reach the next
available public transportation hub, and it appeared that refuse had not been
collected either. Traffic jams in the surrounding areas were severe as
motorists were unable to take their normal routes due to road closures. SOURCE: NEWS24
