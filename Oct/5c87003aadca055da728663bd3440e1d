NKOSI Zwelenkosi Dalasile yesterday begged parents not to close a school where teachers allegedly raped three boys. This was at a heated meeting at the school in Ngcobo, Eastern Cape. The meeting was between the teachers, SGB, parents and unions. The school was closed by parents a week before the holidays after three boys, aged between 14 and 17, claimed they were raped by teachers, aged between 30 and 49. The boys said the teachers took them to their homes and gave them booze before raping them. Dalasile said: “Closing the school would be halting progress. Personal interests must be set aside. Not every teacher that did this is here.” Parents said they didn’t want the school to be closed, but they wanted justice. A parent said: “We don’t feel safe and our children aren’t feeling safe with the current SGB. We’re making this decision because of our children.” Education department officials told the meeting they were investigating whether more pupils might have been violated. Before the meeting, cops had a session with just over 100 kids to educate them about sexual assault. Community leader Vuyani Matshikitsha said the school won’t be closed. “We built this school ourselves. It will operate as normal and we will not burn it,” he said.
