  BONGI Ntuli stole the show in the dying minutes against Cape
Town City to inspire AmaZulu to their first victory of the 2019-20 Absa
Premiership campaign. Usuthu came to this encounter sitting at the bottom of the
log with two points from draws against Orlando Pirates and Golden Arrows while
losing the other five matches. Ntuli scored in each half of the game goals which ensured
they get their first win of the campaign which will serve as a huge morale
booster going forward. The former Mamelodi Sundowns striker scored in the 10th
minute of the game with a header from a perfectly timed cross of Talent
Chawapiwa. Ntuli broke City’s
hearts in the dying minutes of the game when he completed his brace. The three points saw them moving from the foot of the table
to position 14 with five points. Usuthu has now scored four goals in eight league matches and
all of those goals came from Ntuli. This was AmaZulu’s coach Jozef Vukusic's first win in three
matches. Vukusic replaced Cavin Johnson who was sacked after five
games following a trying of poor results. In his first game in charge, the Slovakian mentor lost 2-0
to Kaizer Chiefs and 1-0 to SuperSport United. Former Orlando Pirates and Bloemfontein Celtic dribbling
wizard Mark Mayambela scored for City on his debut but that was not enough to
get the points on the day. City announced the signing of Mayambela hours before the
game and they wasted no time as he was in the starting XI. Mayambela had been without a club since July after he passed
ways with Chippa ending a two year spell with the club. The defeat with now put The Citizens coach Benni McCarthy
under an immense pressure as they have now gone seven matches in all
competitions without a win. In the league City have managed to get only one
victory where they defeated fellow Cape Townians Stellenbosch FC 1-0 in August.
City now occupies the 10th spot on the log with just eight points after eight
games.
