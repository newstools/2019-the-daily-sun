ILLEGAL connections are an ongoing problem in Ekurhuleni. More than 1 500 illegal connections were removed in Brakpan yesterday by city and Eskom officials, accompanied by cops. This was the second operation. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe told Daily Sun the first operation, on Tuesday, resulted in about 1 200 illegal connections being removed in the Somalia and Wolf squatter camps. Gadebe said: “These add to the 86 000 illegal connections the city has disconnected in the past year. “The city is losing more than R600 million in revenue to electricity theft every year, in addition to the losses suffered by local businesses during electricity outages caused by illegal connections.” Eight people face charges of tempering with essential infrastructure. Squatter camp resident Gladys Mthethwa (55) said: “Yes, it’s dangerous. But people need electricity. What are we supposed to do?” Mavis Motha (49) told the People’s Paper: “We’ll continue to make illegal connections, so long as we don’t have electricity. So make a plan.”
