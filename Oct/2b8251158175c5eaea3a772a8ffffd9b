CONCERNED parents of pupils at Ndindindi Primary School in Mbuzini, Mpumalanga, have shut down the dilapidated school. There’s been no schooling since Monday and pupils are sitting at home. KILLED AT HIS DOORSTEP! Parents have since last year been accusing the department of education of failing to respond to their demands for a new school to be built. Speaking on behalf of the parents yesterday, Sicelo Mpofu (29) said the conditions under which their children learning were not safe.

Instead they brought temporary classes, which were blown by the wind. “The mobile classes are not stable or safe. We cannot allow our children to continue learning in such conditions,” he said. Mpofu said parents had been meeting officials from the department who promised to bring a contractor, but nothing had been done. “The response they gave us was not clear. It’s best that we keep our kids away from school until we get assurance that a new school will be built. WATCH: COP AND THE NAKED TRUTH! “The safety of our children is very important,” he said. Mpofu said the department must, in the meantime, provide new mobile classes so their children could be able to write their final exams. Last year the community burnt down the school demanding a new one. The department said it would not fix torched schools as there was no budget allocated for such instances. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department had received a report that some of the mobile classes provided had since become dilapidated. “To this effect, the department has started a process to replace them. In due course, the mobile will be delivered to the school,” he said.
