Rapper Gigi Lamayne is all about giving a helping hand to the less fortunate and she will put this into effect next week Thursday. The artist whose real name is Genesis Gabriella Tina Manney, told Daily Sun that she felt there was a need for her to give back her  clothes and food packages. Speaking to SunBuzz the 25-year-old said: “It is something I do every single year. I love giving people as we are family.” She said she wants people to join her as they share the little they have with other community members and was just busy with spring cleaning and thought of those who might need the clothes. The musician said she hasn't selected the orphanage or beneficiaries yet but once people come forward in numbers they will brainstorm which places to go to around Joburg. “I am just waiting for people to come forward. I am here to bring change with them,” said the rapper. Gigi Lamayne said they will also do a lunch together with those who are doing matric for their matric dance. “We just want to have fun with everyone. We know how this time of the year can be and we need each other more as Africans,”she said. The rapper said she is currently working on an album with other big giants in the music industry. She said: "It is something people would jam to. It is what I always wanted to do.”
