MONEY troubled Bojanala Platinum District Municipality has been extended a helping hand. The municipality based in Rustenburg in the North West has been sent two officials by the North West Provincial Government to fill positions of the precautionary suspended Municipal Manager and Chief Financial Officer. Desiree Tlhoaele will take over as Acting Municipal Manager after Pogiso Shikwane, while Morena Mofokeng will take over from Olga Ndlovu as Chief Financial Officer with immediate effect. But the main reason is to oversee that municipal employee payments from September and October are paid on time. The intervention comes after months of protests by disgruntled workers over money issues. Since July 2019 workers have complained of having issues with their payments. While some were lucky to get half of their salaries others received nothing. Municipal spokesman Archie Babeile said the municipality welcomes the intervention and the administration of the employee payments is of top priority. "Top priority on the agenda is to ensure that employeesâ€™ salary payments for September and October are processed as a matter of urgency. Processes are currently underway, with the first being to facilitate the request of the early release of Equitable Shares trench by the National Treasury, "he said.
