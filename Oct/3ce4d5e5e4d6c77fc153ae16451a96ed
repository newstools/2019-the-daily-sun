IS Norman Mapeza the man to save Chippa United? The Chilli Boys have fumbled, losing matches which they should have won effortlessly in their opening eight Absa Premiership fixtures. And Mapeza, who will be the fourth coach to lead the team this season following the axing of Clinton Larsen, faces an enormous task. Duran Francis and Mbuyiselo Sambo are the other coaches who had a short stint in charge of the club on a caretaker basis and none of them managed to steer the sinking ship out of troubled waters. Chippa have not won a match since the league started and the new coach is expected to hit the ground running when he takes charge of his first match in the opening round of the Telkom Knockout on the weekend of 19-22 October. The Zimbabwean mentor joined the Chilli Boys last week on a three-year deal. And the question now is, he will be able to finish his 36 months spell with the club that have had 29 coaches in 10 years? That remains to be seen. On Tuesday night Chippa suffered their fourth defeat of the season when they lost 1-0 to Bidvest Wits. The defeat saw them sink to the bottom of the table. Sambo, who was in charge, said it would have been nice to welcome the new coach with a win to reduce the pressure. “It is disappointing,” said Sambo who added: “But we have players that are mature enough and will be able to bounce back.” Mapeza was in the stands at Sisa Dukashe Stadium when they lost to Wits. The former Ajax Cape Town and Zimbabwe defender led FC Platinum to back-to-back Zimbabwean Premier League title wins in 2017 and 2018. Last season he helped FC Platinum reach the Caf Champions’ League group stages.
