PUBLIC Transport Voice spokesman Dalton Ndongeni says there’s a third force behind the burning of trains in Cape Town. Another train was set alight at Glencairn Train Station in Simon’s Town on Monday afternoon. “I think this is not about a person taking chances,” said Ndongeni. “This is an inside job. I don’t know for sure what caused today’s fire, but these fires look calculated. “The people who do this know there’s no security on trains and at the station, so it can’t be a random person.”  Cape Town commuters are upset by the ongoing attacks on trains and the recent torching of four coaches on the Southern Line on Monday afternoon. “I don’t think there’s an end to this. It’s been long since this thing has been going on. Government has failed to keep trains safe,” said Mxolisi Mcetywa from Muizenberg. “The problem is that the attacks affect commuters and no one else.” READ: GOSPEL SINGER: “AT HOME HE WAS THE DEVIL HIMSELF!” Fire and rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse said: “At 1.40pm, the city service responded to reports of a train on fire at Glencairn Railway Station. “One motorised locomotive and two carriages were severely damaged and another carriage slightly damaged. The fire was put out at 4.05pm.” Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott confirmed the incident. “The cost of the damage will only be confirmed once Prasa loss adjusters assess the damage,” said Scott.
