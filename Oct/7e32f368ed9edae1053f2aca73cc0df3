England were well-deserved winners of their Rugby World Cup semi-final against defending champions New Zealand in Yokohama on Saturday. England won 19-7 after leading 10-0 at half-time. In addition to their second minute try by centre Manu Tuilagi, England had two further tries ruled out by South African TMO Marius Jonker.Flyhalf George Ford, a masterstroke selection by coach Eddie Jones, added four penalties, while centre Owen Farrell was on target with a conversion. For the All Blacks, their horror 2019 continued. Having finished a dismal third in the Rugby Championship earlier in the year, they failed to mount any sort of meaningful challenge in the face of a relentless - and physically superior - onslaught from their English foes.New Zealand's only points came courtesy of a try by flank Ardie Savea following a botched England lineout on their own tryline. Flyhalf Richie Mo'unga added the conversion.England will face the winner of Sunday's second semi-final between Wales and the Springboks (11:00 SA time) in the final next Saturday in Yokohama.The All Blacks will take on the loser of Sunday's clash in the playoff for third place in Tokyo next Friday.Scorers:EnglandTry: Manu TuilagiPenalties: George Ford (4)Conversion: Owen FarrellNew ZealandTry: Ardie SaveaConversion: Richie Mo'ungaTeams:England15 Elliot Daly, 14 Anthony Watson, 13 Manu Tuilagi, 12 Owen Farrell (captain), 11 Jonny May, 10 George Ford, 9 Ben Youngs, 8 Billy Vunipola, 7 Sam Underhill, 6 Tom Curry, 5 Courtney Lawes, 4 Maro Itoje, 3 Kyle Sinckler, 2 Jamie George, 1 Mako VunipolaSubstitutes: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Joe Marler, 18 Dan Cole, 19 George Kruis, 20 Mark Wilson, 21 Willi Heinz, 22 Henry Slade, 23 Jonathan JosephNew Zealand15 Beauden Barrett, 14 Sevu Reece, 13 Jack Goodhue, 12 Anton Lienert-Brown, 11 George Bridge, 10 Richie Mo'unga, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Ardie Savea, 6 Scott Barrett, 5 Sam Whitelock, 4 Brodie Retallick, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Cody Taylor, 1 Joe MoodySubstitutes: 16 Dane Coles, 17 Ofa Tu'ungafasi, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Sam Cane, 21 TJ Perenara, 22 Sonny Bill Williams, 23 Jordie Barrett  SOURCE:Â SPORT24
