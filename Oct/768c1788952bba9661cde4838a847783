HE’S not a spring chicken anymore and one of his legs has been amputated. But that hasn’t stopped madala Zibele Mkhonjeni (86) from doing his gardening and cleaning his yard four times a week. Zibele from Gugulethu, Cape Town, said he refused to use a wheelchair-bound although he has one leg. “I always want to work in my yard. This is the exercise I do for my body.” He told Daily Sun  his leg was amputated 20 years ago after he was diagnosed with diabetes.  He said some of his friends who also had diabetes had since died. “God and my ancestors take care of me, but my lifestyle also helps me to live longer,” Zibele said. “People with diabetes should exercise and eat properly.” He lives with his daughter Sizile, who works, so he’s at home alone most of the time. While he works the garden, his friends and neighbours often visit him.
