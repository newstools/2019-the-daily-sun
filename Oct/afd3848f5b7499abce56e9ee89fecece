MZANSI has truly embraced the popular Toyota Avanza since the first generation was launched almost a decade ago. Yes, the Avanza has been around since 2010 and today it’s a common sight on Mzansi roads. According to Toyota, it sells an average of 440 Avanzas each month – making it a formidable player in both the MPV segment and Toyota’s passenger-car line-up. The Avanza’s combination of seven-seater capacity, high ground clearance, easy-to-maintain mechanical components and affordability, have appealed to a wide range of both private and business users.  For 2019, the flagship TX model has received some major design and quality upgrades, while keeping the core customer requirements. Mechanical specifications remain unchanged. The S and SX grades retain their current exterior design and packaging.  In the TX-guise, the Avanza gets a fresh appearance with a more aggressive front-end design with the new split-level LED-headlights, including vertically-arranged air dams and fog light garnish. Moving to the rear, there is a new boot spoiler, revised tail lights and a chrome accent strip that help the new TX model stand out.  Other stand-out design features include a more aerodynamically-shaped exterior mirrors, shark-fin antenna and turbine-shaped 15-inch alloy wheels. There are interior tweaks too and the TX-model’s rotary-dial-type air-con controls are replaced with push-buttons with digital readout. In line with customer requests the interior trim has been changed from light grey to dark grey. All Avanza models are sold with a 60 000km service plan and a three-year/100 000km warranty.
