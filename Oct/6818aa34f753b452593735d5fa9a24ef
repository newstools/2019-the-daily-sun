FORMER Bafana Bafana coach Clive Barker has no qualms about the fact that Safa have not honoured him. Barker remains the most successful Bafana coach, having guided them to the African Nations Cup triumph on home soil in 1996 and qualified South Africa for their maiden Fifa World Cup in 1998. “The Dog”, as he was affectionately known during his heydays with Bafana, is yet to be honoured by the association. However, he is not losing any sleep over the fact he hasn’t fully received the recognition many would expect from the association for someone who has delivered the country’s only major football title so far. “It is their (Safa) decision. But if they want to honour me, I’ll be delighted. If they don’t, I’ll still be okay,” said Barker. “I’m not feeling bad. I don’t feel bad about anything in football.” The 75-year-old was in charge of 43 Bafana games. His record reads: won 22, drew 9, lost 12. The former AmaZulu and Santos coach will be celebrated in his home province, KwaZulu-Natal, next month. There will be a Barker Honorary Gala Dinner to be attended by those who have worked and crossed paths with him throughout his coaching. A jersey belonging to Mark Fish will be auctioned during the event with proceed going to Barker’s academy. Among those expected to attend is the Safa leadership, the PSL, AmaZulu, KZN Masters officials, politicians and business people. Players from the famous 1996 squad will be Barker’s guests of honour on the day. Other festivities lined up is an honorary game that will take place at the iconic Moses Mabhida Stadium during the Fifa break next month. It will feature the Class of ‘96 team against an African XI team, the KZN media team, eThekwini councillors team, Banyana Banyana legendary players, eThekwini SALGA Ladies Team, alongside PSL legendary players from Gauteng and KZN. Former Nigeria and AC Milan and Inter Milan defender Taribo West is also coming along with former Zambia star Kalusha Bwalwa.
