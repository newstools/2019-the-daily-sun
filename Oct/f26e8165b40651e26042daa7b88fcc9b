Woman dreams of swallowing her engagement ring and woke to
find it was true. She woke up and was relieved to realise it had been a dream,
but then it became a nightmare when she realised, she wasn't wearing the ring. Itâ€™s reported that Jenna Evans was on a high-speed train
when she had a dream. In the dream there were "bad guys" and she said
the only way to protect her 2.4 carat diamond ring was to swallow it. "I popped that sucker off, put it in my mouth and
swallowed it with a glass of water," Ms Evans said in a Facebook post. She said: "When I woke up in the morning, there was no
ring on my finger. "I couldn't help but laugh at it, and then I had to
wake my fiance up and tell him that I had swallowed my engagement ring." According to Sky News, Jenna went to an urgent care clinic
where doctors decided not to allow the ring to pass through naturally and
referred her to a specialist. She cried as she signed the forms for carrying out the
procedure because she feared she might die. In her Facebook post, she wrote: "I waited a long time
for that damn engagement ring and I WILL marry Bobby Howell DAMNIT." Doctors located the ring in Ms Evans' intestines and Mr
Howell presented her with it again.
