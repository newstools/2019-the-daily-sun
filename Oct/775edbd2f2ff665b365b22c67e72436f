THE sun was setting while Tshekisho Jakwe cooked a meal for her husband and son. But suddenly, the peaceful scene was interrupted by a deafening bang. WHEN THE THREE RUSHED OUTSIDE, THEY WERE HORRIFIED TO SEE A PLANE HAD CRASHED IN THEIR YARD! The 54-year-old mum said her son Lesedi (35), husband Biekieboy (63) and herself were still in shock over the dramatic events that happened at their home in Huhudi kasi in Vryburg, North West, on Sunday. When the SunTeam visited the house yesterday, cops were still attending to the scene, leaving the family stranded. Tshekisho said she heard a loud bang on her roof at around 6pm. “I screamed because I thought my house was falling apart. I ran to the bedroom to check on my husband, who was sleeping,” she said. While Tshekisho was rushing to the bedroom, Biekieboy woke up to see a cloud of smoke. She said: “I didn’t understand what was going on. Together with my son, we went outside to check. I saw a man running towards the back of our yard before falling to the ground. At least it didn’t crash on us. We nearly died.” Biekieboy said he was still waiting for the owner of the aircraft to approach him to discuss the damage. “My house has big cracks all over. “It could fall over at any time,” he said. It later emerged the 30-year-old pilot of the aircraft was killed in the crash but his passenger, a Huhudi resident, survived. A neighbour said she took the survivor to the hospital. “He came out of the plane in shock and started running. “He looked like he wanted to collapse but I rushed him to the hospital,” she said. North West police spokesman Captain Sam Tselanyane said a case of culpable homicide was opened.
