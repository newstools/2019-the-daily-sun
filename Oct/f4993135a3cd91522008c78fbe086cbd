PITSO Mosimane’s lament about his team’s poor form in front of goal not only rings true, but it’s well-documented. Since the departure of the goal-poachers Percy Tau and Khama Billiat, Mamelodi Sundowns haven’t been the free-scoring team. But anyone who saw them pummel hapless Cote d’Or from the Seychelles 11-1 to advance to the Caf Champions League group stages with a 16-1 aggregate will agree the Brazilians have rediscovered their Midas touch. The group-stage draw will be conducted in Cairo tomorrow. Of course, the Seychelles minnows aren’t world beaters and they weren’t expected to offer much resistance, not after they were bullied into submission (5-0) in the first leg at home. The massive score-line further underlined the gulf in class between the Seychelles teams and South African sides, as seen with Bantwana’s 28-0 victory over their Islanders peers in the U-17 Women’s Cosafa Cup tourney currently underway in Victoria. Mosimane has insisted his team is a work in progress and it’s not yet “where I’d want it to be.” But after the demolition job in Atteridgeville on Friday, the Sundowns coach can safely say his men are responding positively to his tactics in the continental tournament. In fact, he was not shocked by the huge scoreline against the Seychelles “fishermen”. Sibusiso Vilakazi banged in a hat-trick, Themba Zwane netted two while Gaston Sirino, Anele Ngcongca, Mauricio Affonso, Madisha Motjeka all scored one goal apiece. Sundowns will play Black Leopards on Wednesday.
