An illegal restaurant was found operating under the basement of
a Hillbrow flats. JMPD spokesman, superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun
that the restaurant was found when officers were checking bad buildings at the
Joburg CBD on a two day #BuyaMthetho operation which started on Wednesday night
and ended this morning. Minnaar said the aim
of the raids was to weed out criminal elements and determine if municipal
by-laws are being contravened. Even though cops think this was a great idea, Joburg
residents disagree with them shutting down these restaurants. "This is entrepreneurship, assist in registering,
compliance and perhaps relocation. They have created a few jobs," said
Nelson Ngwenya. "Those are your officers' spots. They buy food from there
on a regular basis. Stop acting like you didn't know that stall before
today," said Matlatse Mokoena. Others suggested that police should start educating them instead
of taking bread off their mouths. "Nothing wrong there, rooftop, underwater, over water it's a
restaurant and patrons prefer that. Unless you clearly state the bylaws being
broken, leave people along and go home," said Mangaliso
