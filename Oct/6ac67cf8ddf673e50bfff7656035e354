LEAKING
your ex-partnerâ€™s nudes will now get you in big trouble. President
Cyril Ramaphosa has signed into law the Act which criminalises revenge porn. Last
week, the president, signed into law the Films and Publications Amendment Act
11 of 2019 which criminalises revenge porn. Revenge
porn is when an ex-partner maliciously share naked, nude or sexually
explicit photos of someone else without their permission in order to humiliate
them or make profit. It can be distributed via social media, text messages,
emails or even uploaded onto pornographic websites. The
Act also aims to clamp down on the distribution of child pornography and images
or videos of a sexual nature without the consent of the person featured. Under
the bill, people found breaking the this law will get a possible fine not
exceeding R150,000 or will be sent to imprisonment for a period not exceeding
two years and/or to both a fine and imprisonment not exceeding two years. Where
the individual is identified or identifiable in said photographs and films,
this punishment rises to a R300,000 fine and/or imprisonment not exceeding four
years.
