HIGHLANDS Park’s new signing Reneilwe Letsholonyane is settling nicely into life at his new home. The 37-year-old joined Siyabangena/Siyabahlaba last week on a one year deal after training with the Tembisa outfit for several weeks. Letsholonyane, who brings a wealth of experience with him having played for the likes of Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United, is adamant that he still has a lot to offer. “I’m happy to be part of this young group that works hard and is willing to learn each and every day. They also want to achieve things, you can see that at training and during the games,” said Letsholonyane. “They might not play the most pleasing football on the eye, but they are effective and work very hard. That’s what I like about this team. “A few off the field reasons also influenced my decision to come here, for example my family. I had to consider the dynamics of moving to another province, setting up and adjusting to new surroundings.” Letsholonyane will also play a huge role in the dressing room, serving as a leader to some of the younger players at the club. “My role will involve quite a bit of teaching, I will be teaching the youngsters not by saying a lot of stuff, but by doing and leading by example. I believe young people learn a lot more by seeing other people doing things and living a certain way than they do when they are told,” added Letsholonyane. Letsholonyane will be looking to help the Tembisa outfit beat his former team SuperSport United in the final of the MTN 8 set to played at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (6.pm).
