SEE you in a fortnight! That was the scream from Mamelodi Sundowns coach, Pitso Mosimane, who took their 4-2 loss to Kaizer Chiefs too personal, and has threatened to break the Naturena outfit into small pieces when they meet again in the Absa Premiership. The Brazilians will host Chiefs in their league fixture at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on 27 October, a clash that Mosimane made it clear that it will be payback time. “If they can score four goals, then we can also outscore them,” Mosimane said following their Shell Helix Ultra Cup match at FNB Stadium on Saturday. “There is no friendly between Chiefs and Sundowns.” Former Sundowns players Leonardo Castro and Khama Billiat came back to haunt their former club. Castro recording a hat-trick and assisted the Zimbabwean score the fourth goal. After a couple of substitutions after the break, Ali Meza and Gaston Sirino scored two for Downs. Mosimane started with players like Aubrey Ngoma, Andile Jali and Oupa Manyisa and new signing Tokelo Rantie, who had not played in an official game this season. Mosimane admitted: “Castro and Billiat came back to bite me. But see you in two weeks’ time. I can assure you it will be a completely different ball game. We lost a game, not a friendly. “There is no excuse, Chiefs beat us fair and square. I refreshed the team and we lost, it’s not a gamble.” The defending PSL title coach, Mosimane, played the devil’s advocate when he tipped Chiefs to win the 2019-20 title. “They are a well-rested and focused, while we are constantly on the plane travelling all over Africa in Caf Champions League matches.” Manyisa was stretched off the pitch and Mosimane confirmed that he is out for the rest of the season.
