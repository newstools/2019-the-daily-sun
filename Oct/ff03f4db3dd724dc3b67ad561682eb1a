WHEN the car guards found money on the ground, they didn’t realise they were about to have an epic battle. A taxi driver accused them of stealing his money and called his friends over. But like David beat Goliath, the car guards ended up victorious. Car guard Tshepiso Mokoena (28) said the trouble started at Selcourt Towers in Springs, Ekurhuleni, on Friday when he and two colleagues picked up R270 in cash. “The money was scattered because there was wind. When we picked it up, we didn’t know where it had come from.” Tshepiso said a while later, a taxi driver approached them. “He was aggressive and started assaulting me. The man and his two friends bundled me into a taxi and said they were taking me somewhere to beat me up. They accused me of pick pocketing the taximan.” Tshepiso said when his friends saw what was happening, they told the taximen to release him. “I jumped out the window to save my life. One of the taximen started attacking my friends. That was when one of us hit one of them in the face and he fell to the ground.” Bheki Mahlangu (29), another car guard, said there was a fist fight, but the taxi drivers overpowered them and tied them up with cable ties. “They called the cops and they took us to Springs Police Station. After hearing our story, they released us,” he said. Taximen Jantjie Leo and Sphiwe Mtshwene said the car guards attacked them first. Springs Taxi Association secretary general Themba Gininda said he wasn’t aware of the incident but would investigate. Selcourt Towers management couldn’t be reached for comment. Captain Johannes Ramphora said no case was opened.
