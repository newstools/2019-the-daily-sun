A VIDEO of a Joburg Metro cop involved in a street fight with a taximan has surfaced on social media. It’s not clear when or where the incident took place. In the video, first seen on Friday, the two men are seen wrestling and rolling on the ground. Senior Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said no formal complaint was registered. “We’re aware of the footage but are yet to receive information about what happened. The department is investigating and trying to identify the cop.” Yesterday, United Taxi Associations Front spokesman Sipho Nkwanyana said: “Such behaviour won’t be tolerated from taxi drivers registered with our association. We call on cops to bust the suspect.” In another case, a female officer was attacked by an angry mob at Pan Africa Shopping Centre in Alexandra last Sunday. A video of the attack shows a crowd shouting at the cops and a scuffle follows. Minnaar said one cop was taken to Milpark Hospital. “Police were conducting investigations for illegal street trading and, as a result, the mob decided to attack them.” Minnaar said two suspects were bust and officers would return to the area. “Disrespect for officers will never be tolerated. Any attack on a Metro cop will be taken seriously.”
