AMAZULU powerful striker Bongi Ntuli doesn’t think the international break has come at the bad time for the team. In fact, he thinks this will give coach Jozef Vukusic enough time to assess all the players following his recent appointment by Usuthu. When AmaZulu roped in the former Polokwane City mentor as their head coach on 18 September, he only had two full days to prepare his first game. It was against Kaizer Chiefs three days later at King Zwelithini Stadium. It was where they were controversially defeated 2-0, with referee assistant Meryvn van Wyk becoming a talking point on that day. Vukusic has since got his first win of the season against Cape Town City last Wednesday. It was Ntuli who was the heart of all when he netted twice on the day to see the Durban-based side move off the bottom of the log. “The momentum won’t be affected because the coach is still new and he still wants to know all of us,” an adamant Ntuli said. Ntuli said on the club’s first win: “We are relieved as a team. “But since the coach arrived, we have been playing well and it is just that luck has not been on our side.” The two goals for Ntuli were the landmark in his personal career. When he scored the first goal against Benni McCarthy’s side on the day, it was his 50th goal in his PSL career. He then scored in the last minutes of added time when he slipped the ball under the legs of Peter Leeuwnburgh to net his 51, having made his PSL debut in 2011-12 season when he was still playing for Golden Arrows. Ntuli, who’s best scoring in a season was in 2013-14 season with Abafana Bes’Thende and last season with Usuthu when he scored seven league goals, has four so far this season. The 28-year-old has set his sights on the PSL Golden Boot. The league’s top scorer thus far is Highlands Park striker Peter Shalulile, who is on six. “I want to keep on scoring this season. Hopefully it will lead to better things,” added Ntuli.
