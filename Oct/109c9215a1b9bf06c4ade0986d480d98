JAYDEN and Jade Keppler are already showing signs of becoming great soccer players at the age of 10. The twins were selected to take part in a tournament in Spain in March. They were chosen by their team, Eastside Kings Football Club, from Tshwane. The Mundialito Tournament in Salou, Spain, is one of the world’s biggest junior football tournaments in the world. More than 50 countries from five continents participate each year. It will cost R34 000 for each kid to cover their accommodation, tickets and food costs. Although the twins are excited about travelling overseas, their unemployed mum Virginia is worried. The mum of four, from East Lynne, in Tshwane said she doesn’t know how she’ll raise the money. She said she’s worried about disappointing her kids. “I told them they’ll have to stop playing soccer if their marks drop, but their marks keep improving. “They’re doing well at school and on the soccer field,” she said. “If I was employed, I’d apply for a loan. But I don’t have any income. “I’m thinking of organising a concert or selling food to try to raise the money,” she said. Virginia said her hopes lie with SunReaders. “I’ve seen people get help from Daily Sun,” she said. Eastside Kings Football Club coach, Sphiwe Clint, said the team relied on the twins for a win. He said Jayden’s a defender, while Jade’s a striker. “It will be bad for the team if they don’t go to Spain. We hope money will be raised for them to travel,” he said.
