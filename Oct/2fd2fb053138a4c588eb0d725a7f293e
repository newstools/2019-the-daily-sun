earlier on Tuesday police were alerted to a robbery at an electronics store at
the mall.  "It is reported that a group of men entered the store
and stole several electronics/appliances. The robbers allegedly fired shots as
they fled, resulting in one security guard being wounded and rushed to
hospital."  She said a lookout was activated for the robbers' two
vehicles and members from the Anti-Gang Unit spotted and cornered the suspects
in a Nissan NP200 on the highway.  "A shootout ensued and one suspect was declared dead on
the scene, one [was] arrested and one managed to evade arrest and is still on
the run with police hot on his heels."  One firearm was recovered from the vehicle and will be subjected
to ballistic testing to establish possible linkage to previous crimes, Peters
added.  Police were currently still searching for a second vehicle,
a white VW Polo hatchback which went in the direction of Pimville, Soweto.  Gauteng Commissioner of Police, Lieutenant General Elias
Mawela applauded the vigilance of the members that led to the rapid response
and swift apprehension of the suspects.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/just-in-shooting-at-joburg-mall-one-suspect-arrested-20191008
