Kaizer Chiefs forward Khama Billiat believes Amakhosi should treat Sunday's clash with Mamelodi Sundowns as just another opportunity for three points. There is a great deal of hype ahead of the match with Chiefs at the top of the table and Sundowns just two points off the pace in second (with a game in hand). Amakhosi claimed the bragging rights the last time the sides met two weeks ago when Chiefs triumphed 4-2 in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup. While many feel that this fixture could be a potential title-deciding contest, Billiat believes it is still too early to say. "This game will not determine our destiny," The 29-year-old told Chiefs' official website. "We are not putting ourselves under pressure because we will have equally tough games to come. We need to collect as many points as we can in these early stages." Billiat wants the Amakhosi to put the Shell Helix Ultra Cup victory out of their minds as it may lead to complacency. "Having played against them recently, we know they are not going to make it easy for us," said Billiat. "We will go into the game with the right mindset, not getting carried away that we beat them a few weeks ago. "Right now, it requires a lot of hard work from us and we need to work on the details of the game, which will hopefully help us get the result we want. "We always want to win every game no matter the circumstances – that’s the culture we have in the team. When you are winning, it brings you and your fans joy. "We hope we have a good run for the rest of the season. It's going to demand a lot of us. We are winning games at the moment, and we want to keep that up, which means we have to do the right things every day and in every game. "We need three points in every league game we play. This will put us in a better position than we were before the game." Kick-off is at 15:30 on Sunday. SOURCE: SPORT24
