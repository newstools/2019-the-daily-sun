FORMER national deputy director of public prosecutions, Nomgcobo Jiba, is giving MPs a headache. Siviwe Njikela of Parliament’s legal services today told the justice and correctional services committee it would continue dealing with Jiba’s fight to keep her job after she was fired by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Jiba took the matter to court last month and lost. The DA’s Werner Horn said: “I think we have a duty to afford her a final opportunity to make representations.” The ANC’s Jacqueline Mofokeng said: “We gave her a chance to present her case, but she didn’t use it.” Jiba wants Parliament to consider whether she was lawfully axed. But Njikela said the president’s decision did not have to be confirmed by Parliament. “The decision of the president is an independent decision. It’s not subject to confirmation. Parliament must only decide whether it has found good grounds to restore.” Committee chairman Gratitude Magwanishe gave Jiba 10 days to make representations.
