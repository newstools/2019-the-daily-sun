MARIO Booysen is rumoured to have signed a six months contract for AmaZulu, according to our sources. The defender will stay on with Usuthu until end of the current season. Meanwhile, club coach Jozef Vukusic is apparently ready to sign former Kaizer Chiefs full-back Tsepo Masilela, but wants to assess him further before committing. Both defenders have been training with Usuthu for two weeks now. Masilela was released by Chiefs at the end of the 2017-18 season while Booysen was let go at the end of last season.  “Tsepo Masilela is still not fit to play. He’s going to be given more time,” our mole said. This will be Booysen's second stint playing for a KwaZulu-Natal club, having donned the colours of Maritzburg United before he joined Sundowns in 2014-15 season. The 34-year-old Masilela, meanwhile, has been clubless since he was released by Chiefs, almost two seasons ago. He has not played competitive football since then with his last appearance in the PSL being with Chiefs against Golden Arrows on 24 April last year. AmaZulu are short at left-back position following news that Sibusiso Mabiliso is going to be out for sometime with a foot injury. “I’m still going to meet with the technical team with the regards to these players.” said Usuthu general manager Lunga Sokhela.
