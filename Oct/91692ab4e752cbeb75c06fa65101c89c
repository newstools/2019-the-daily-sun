Sama winner, singer, songwriter and guitarist Bongeziwe Mabandla has dished out great music. His latest single, Jikeleza, has captured music lovers’ attention since its release. It’s picking up from where his successful single Zange, released in June, left of. The singer, who’s on a two-month European tour, said his latest single is his love letter to all his people. “This song is about love giving us life. It’s about our universal need to connect,” he said. “It’s about the togetherness in people and about the things that bind us and make us the same.” Bongeziwe said writing the song was challenging. “It took a lot of rewriting before I got it right,” said the Tsolo-born artist. Bongeziwe said the idea came together when he made each part distinct, with each verse coming from a different place. “Jikeleza has a South African feel but with a mix of a very modern global texture,” he said. “The song has a playful side to it, and while it’s probably my most fun single to date, it’s also very special as it comes from a compassionate place. “It’s a positive song with a very relevant message in South Africa right now.” He said he loves music because it has the power to change things. Bongeziwe thinks music has the ability to make people think and change. “Like many artists trying to make sense of this difficult world, I write about trying to make it, about growing up poor and without a father, about falling in and out of love,” he said. “I think people will find themselves in my lyrics because my lyrics come from a genuine place.” Bongeziwe released his first album, Umlilo, in 2012 and it was followed by Mangaliso in 2017, which scored him his first Sama last year. Over the years he has toured Australia, Asia and Canada, and performed at several international and national festivals.
