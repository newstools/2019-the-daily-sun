It’s human nature to wonder whether you are having more or
less sex than others. But it’s a difficult question to answer. Many factors can influence how often people have sex.
Relationship status, health and age can all play a role. Couples who are in the
early “honeymoon” stage of their relationship may have sex frequently. As the
relationship progresses, the rate might slow down. If they are busy with work
or childcare, they might not have as much time for sex as they used to. If they
have an illness or chronic pain, they might have less sex – but that might
change if they’re feeling better. The Kinsey Institute provided these statistics on the sexual
frequency of men and women. Much depended on whether the respondents were
single, partnered, or married. Men • Only 2% of single men between the ages of 18 and 24 had
sex 4 or more times per week, but 21% of married men did. • Just under half of married men between the ages of 25 and
49 had sex a few times per month to weekly. This was the highest rate in this
age category. • Age was not necessarily a deterrent to sexual frequency.
Thirteen percent of single men age 70 and older had sex a few times per month
to weekly. For partnered and married men in this age group, the rates were 63%
and 15% respectively. Women • About 5% of single women between the ages of 18 and 24 had
sex 4 or more times per week, but 24% of married women did. • Like the men, just under half of the women between the
ages of 25 and 59 had sex a few times per month to weekly, more than their
single and partnered peers. • Sexual frequency did decrease with age for women, although
almost a quarter of partnered women over age 70 had sex more than 4 times a
week, according to the survey. - International Society for Sexual Medicine
