Fed-up workers emptied buckets full of kak at eThekwini municipal offices on Thursday. The mobile toilets cleaners in squatter camps from around Durban decided to dump kak because they said they havenâ€™t been paid their salaries in a long time. Staff and security guards at water and sanitation offices in central Durban ran for their lives when the angry workers armed with shovels and carrying buckets full of kak stormed the building.  Workers started spreading kak all over the offices. Cops arrived after an hour and found the group still there. They were seen negotiating with them to calm down. People who came for municipal services were turned away as the offices were temporarily closed.  Workers leader Ndumiso Nojiyeza said they haven't been paid salaries for six months so they decided to come and dump kak so that the officials will take them serious. "Residents are living with this smell every day because workers have stopped cleaning the container toilets in the squatter camps, so we want the officials feel how the residents feel," said Nojiyeza.
