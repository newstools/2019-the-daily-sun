THERE’s nothing wrong with ukuthwala. This is according to sangoma Sfiso Qwabe. “As long as you don’t kill anybody,” he said. Qwabe said the work of an inyanga or sangoma is to help and not to kill. “How can you call yourself a healer when you kill or instruct people to kill? Body parts of humans don’t heal,” he said. He said there were different forms of ukuthwala, which people could use to make themselves richer. He said that many izangoma gave people muthi for ukuthwala. “It’s known, but no one wants to talk about it because people assume you are doing the evil ukuthwala. That’s because the word has been painted in a bad light, but it’s just another way of getting luck for yourself. “I give my clients something to help them,” he said. Qwabe said he mostly gave the muthi to people who own shops and taverns or sold things. “I give them a brown bottle with muthi inside. They speak to the bottle and say what they want,” he said. He said if a person uses this muthi for business, customers will come from far to buy from them. “They will pass shops selling the same product to come to your shop,” he said. Bhambatha Masoka (45) a tuckshop owner from Tembisa in Ekurhuleni, said he performed ukuthwala but asked questions first. “I didn’t want to be told to sacrifice my children,” he said. Joyce Mthembu (36) sells vegetables and had to throw away unsold fruit and veggies. After she underwent ukuthwala things got better.
