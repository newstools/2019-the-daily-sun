“GIVE me punani or I’m leaving.” These are the words written on the front of a white minibus taxi, which has angered people across the country. A photo of the taxi went viral on Saturday and many said it was from Kuruman, North West. The words were written in Tswana on the Toyota Hiace with a Northern Cape number plate. Boitumelo Golelwang posted the photo to Facebook and wrote: “Girls from Kuruman are impressed by everything. That’s why they’re not going to get married. Victor Motsepe replied: “This is shocking. I wonder if the person who decided to put those words there was thinking of the small kids who can read. How are boys going to respect women if things like this continue?” Joyqure Monewa said freedom of speech had its limits. “Women in this country don’t get respect. I bet this taxi is operated by a man. Why did he not consider talking about his 4-5 instead?” “I hope the taxi association disciplines the driver and removes those nasty words,” she said. “I could not believe my eyes and that made me laugh,” he said. Terror Mhlaba of the Kimberley Long Distance Taxi Association said the taxi didn’t belong to them. “Irrespective of whether it’s local or long distance, we don’t associate ourselves with such people.” The taxi owner told Daily Sun: “I can assure you the driver has been fired and the words removed.”
