Samir “Kokota Piano” Nurkovic returned to action just in time to face Mamelodi Sundowns in
a much-awaited PSL crunch match on Sunday at the Loftus Stadium in Pretoria. There
is already a lot of tension ahead of the match between the two table-toppers and
the return of the Serbian born forward will boost Amakhosi’s attacking options. After returning from injury this past weekend, he scored a crucial late
equaliser for Chiefs in their penalty shootout victory over Cape Town City in a
Telkom Knockout Last 16 clash. According to a post on the Amakhosi website, Nurkovic had suffered a head
injury when Amakhosi defeated AmaZulu in late September.  He watched the Baroka FC and Golden Arrows from the bench – and also missed
out on two friendlies Chiefs played. “It was a wonderful feeling to come back and score,” Nurkovic told Chiefs
website. “I was out for three weeks and it was a challenging time for me. I
just could not wait to get back onto the pitch and help the team as much as
possible. I am happy to have contributed with a goal against City.” He added: “It was frustrating because it was a head injury. You feel good
because you can run and do everything except play because I could not head the
ball. I am happy now because that is behind me. I am back now, which is what is
important.” Nurkovic who has scored two goals in seven games in all competitions this
season, is now ready to turn his attention to Chiefs upcoming Absa Premiership
clash against Mamelodi Sundowns who are currently in second place with two
points behind Chiefs.
