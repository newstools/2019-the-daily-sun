SWALLOWS FC are not done yet in the market as they continue to search for talent to beef up their squad. After an indifferent start to the season, the Birds are determined to improve their side to ensure they are more competitive going forward. They parted ways with embattled coach Zeca Marques and added experienced players such as Vuyo Mere and Virgil Vries. And now, Swallows have turned to youth in an attempt to find the perfect balance. They have added youngsters Simphiwe Tshabalala and Siphelele Ndlovu to their ranks.  Swallows boss David Mogashoa said it was important for them to build a strong squad for the future as they look to work their way back into the land of milk and honey – the PSL. He added that there was no pressure for new mentor Brandon Trutter, whose mandate is to finish in the top eight this season. “We have signed two exciting youngsters. We have enough experience in the team with the likes of Lebogang Mokoena, Vuyo Mere and Virgil Vries. We need to add some young blood because we are also looking at the future,” said Mogashoa. “We are still looking at signing more players, especially in the striking department. We need a finisher, someone who can put away all the chances that we are creating. We will keep looking until we are satisfied with our options.” Mogashoa has been impressed by new mentor Truter’s impact since taking over the reins last month. “I feel we are headed in the right direction now. We have a new coach who understands the GladAfrica Championship very well. But we don’t want to put him under pressure, we have set realistic goals for him and will be supporting him in every possible way. “There is already a big difference that is evident since he took over. We have a clear structure now and we are playing well.”
