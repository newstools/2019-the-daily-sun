WHEN Lwazi Tembe told his family he was going to visit his former teacher on 30 September, they didn’t see a need to worry as he often visited the man. But that was the last time they saw the 12-year-old from Manguzi in Mhlabuyalingana, northern KZN. Now his family is worried about his whereabouts. Lwazi’s aunt Nokuthula (33) told Daily Sun: “When he left home he told us he was going to see the teacher, who asked him to come to his cottage. We went to the teacher when he didn’t come back home. He said he hadn’t seen Lwazi that day.” Nokuthula said they reported the matter to the police, and even looked for Lwazi at the teacher’s cottage. “We tried calling him, but his phone was on voicemail.” She said they got a message from his number on 2 October notifying them he was still okay. “We called the number, but it was on voicemail and has been on voicemail since.” Nokuthula said the teacher used to teach at Manikela Primary School, where Lwazi is doing grade 6. She said the teacher resigned a few months ago. KZN Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “A missing persons docket was opened, but was later changed to kidnapping.”
