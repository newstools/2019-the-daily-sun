A MONSTER blow has fallen on Maritzburg United. The Team of Choice have lost midfielder Phumlani Ntshangase for the rest of the year. This is the result of a groin injury in the club’s first win of the season over Chippa United at the Harry Gwala Stadium last month. The 24-year-old, who is on loan from Bidvest Wits, was replaced by Thami Sangweni after being stretched off the field, which made him miss another win against Baroka. Coach Eric Tinkler said: “Unfortunately we have lost Phumlani. He’ll be out for quite a while. “Fortunately for him it is not torn and that means he doesn’t need an operation. So he’ll be out for a minimum of three months, which is a massive loss for us because he was starting to show great progress.” But Tinkler is living in hope that he might be back sooner than doctors expect. “I won’t be surprised if he is back early, especially at his age,” Tinkler added. Meanwhile, Kwanda Mngonyama is expected back for the weekend of the Telkom Knockout Round-16 on the weekend of 18-19 October, with the final scheduled for 14 December. Farook Kadodia’s team have been paired with Bidvest Wits after the draw was conducted in Randburg yesterday.
