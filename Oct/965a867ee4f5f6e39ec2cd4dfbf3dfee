PUBLIC Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has released a document outlining government’s plans to fix Eskom. Briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday, he said the road map, called the special paper, would outline ways to overcome the company’s problems. He said the paper would answer questions around putting Eskom on a solid financial and operational footing again. He said the paper included input from government departments, as well as from power utility and other sources. Gordhan noted there had been a movement away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy. “Fixing Eskom is not like changing a tyre. It’s a protracted process,” said the minister. “You need balance between, for example, the number of coal workers versus the world’s shifting view of fossil fuels.” He said damage that state capture caused within the utility was huge and systemic. “It was more than stealing a few billion. Skilled people, particularly black professionals, were chased out of Eskom. This negative impacted the power utility,” he said. He said Finance Minister Tito Mboweni would provide an update on bailouts and the status of government financial support for Eskom when he delivered his mini budget today. He said there would not be too much focus on unbundling the distribution arm of Eskom due to complexities in how it would work.
