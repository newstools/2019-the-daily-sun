THE Adventure Zone Cullinan experience in Pretoria is like starring in your own fantasy action movie punctuated with the thrills of wildlife. In a picturesque safari setting, a team of three dedicated safety creative directors crosses all the Ts and dots the Is before action can resume. The thrill begins with a quad bike ride on turbulent trails led byJean-Pierre Lowe at a modest yet breathtaking pace. He guides the teams through the entire hour-and-a-half drive, navigating through the pristine bush veld and natural water and providing the perfect scenario to see grazing antelope and zebra. Said Jean-Pierre: “This is an exhilaration experience and I find the outdoors to be absolutely amazing. It’s also a marvel for any photographer.” The SunTeam rode through the rough roads growing in confidence to test the limits of the four-wheeled machine. Steep inclines en route posed a challenge as the bikes kept switching off. “No worries,” Jean-Pierre said. “Just ensure to lean forward when you come up a hill, this will help ease the pressure off your back. “Biking seems to the outright favourite, everyone that comes here seems to love it.” Then it’s off to the nerve-wracking Xtreme Zipline, this time under the directorship of two jolly fellows, Reggie Zitha and Koketoso Moshiga. Said Reggie: “We’ll go through four towers, ranging from the longest, which is also the quickest at 75km/h, to the shortest at about 70km/h. If you’re afraid of hights, the zipline is a great start to face your fears. “It takes you over the mountainous landscape, while giving you a nature appreciation lesson.” – www.gauteng.net
