THE family of sangoma Nokwanda Ngconase (54) is traumatised after finding her body in a mortuary last Thursday. The family from Kosovo in Philippi, Cape Town, told Daily Sun she had gone missing last week after going somewhere with a male friend. Nokwanda spent last Monday with other sangomas at an event and afterwards went home with four of them. At midnight, she went out with a male sangoma but never came back. Nokwanda’s daughters Siphokazi Ncanase (25) and Nopasika Mzantsi (34) said were devastated.  Nokwanda had come from Qumbu, Eastern Cape, three weeks earlier to become a sangoma. Neighbour Noxolo Buswana said Nokwanda was like a sister to her.  “I heard them drinking. They were happy and playing music,” she said.  Nokwanda’s body was found on the R300, 2km from her home. The family found her body last Thursday at the mortuary in Salt River. They said her face was injured. Cop spokesman Frederick van Wyk confirmed that a homicide case was registered at Lentegeur Police Station. “According to reports, the victim was knocked over on 23 September at 4.15am at the corner of AZ Berman Drive and Stock Road under a bridge. She died at the scene,” he said. Van Wyk said the driver drove away and was unknown.  “Anyone with information is requested to call the investigating officer, Detective Constable Mcophela, on 021 377 5000,” he said.
