BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has announced a 25-man squad for the upcoming back-to-back 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan. South Africa will face the Black Stars in Accra on Thursday, November 14 and three days later will host Sudan on Sunday, November 17 in Soweto at the Orlando Stadium. Ntseki retained the bulk of the players he selected for the Nelson Mandela Challenge earlier this month with Ronwen Williams, Eric Mathoho, Kamohelo Mokotjo, Dean Furman, Percy Tau, Bradley Grobler and Thembinkosi Lorch all cracking the nod. Defender Thulani Hlatshwayo remains the captain for the crucial encounters. Thamsanqa Mkhize, S'fiso Hlanti and Bongani Zungu returns to the squad while Keegan Dolley is replaced by Aubrey Modiba. "If it is not broken, why fix it," Ntseki said as quoted by the official SAFA website. "We have decided to keep the bulk of the team because they already understand what we want to do, and you will recall this will be my third camp with them â€“ even though we did not play a match in the first one. "It was important to keep that consistency as we also don't have too much to work on things seeing that we are playing two match in a space of three days, which also involves significant travelling."
