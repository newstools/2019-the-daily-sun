ASKED why she took part in violent protests at her age, Nomathamsanqa Butana burst into tears. The 57-year-old from Govan Mbeki kasi in Port Elizabeth said: “I will only stop protesting when government builds me a place for my children I can call home. “The lies and empty promises make me join the youth when they barricade roads with burning tyres and rocks.” The SunTeam caught up with Nomathamsanqa at a protest in Kliprand squatter camp recently. She said she had been applying for an RDP for more than 20 years. “We were moved from Veeplaas in 1993 because our shacks were built on a wetland. My husband and I built a shack in my brother-in-law’s backyard. In 1997, I was told I would get a house in KwaDwesi extension 3, but it never happened,” she said. She said she had been protesting for justice all her life. “During apartheid, I fought oppression. During democracy, I’ve been protesting for an RDP.” She said her 21-year-old daughter had a baby a month ago and she was worried about the child’s health. “Our shack is cold and leaking. When it rains it gets flooded. My husband’s social grant can only look after our basic needs,” she said. Human settlements spokesman Masiza Mazizi said: “The family is confirmed as a destitute case. The department will place them on a priority list and consult with the municipality to provide them with a serviced site.”
