 THE current Isuzi D-MAX bakkie has reached its life-cycle. The current generation D-MAX has been in production since
2012, but if you are a devoted fan of the Isuzu brand who’s in the market to
buy – worry no more. Ford and Toyota have been taking a large sum of the South
African bakkie market pie – but with the Japanese bakkie manufacturer teasing
it’s 2020 D-MAX, things are about to get interesting. It has previously been reported that the next generation
D-MAX will share a platform with the oncoming Mazda BT-50. Now the BT-50 is based on the Ford Ranger. By the looks of things, in the teased video Isuzu is
planning to introduce a better looking interior that will consist of new
technology like an updated Apple CarPlay and Android Auto-compliant
infotainment system.
