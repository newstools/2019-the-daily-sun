MARIO Booysen is training with AmaZulu with the hope securing a deal. The 31-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs centre-back is currently club-less having part ways with Ernst Middendorp's team. "He is still being assessed by the club, but age is not on his side," our mole whispered about the player who surfaced at Usuthu on Wednesday. "In terms of his skills and talents, he is good, but that will depend on the AmaZulu technical team." The Capetonian is expected to make use of the current Fifa international break to express his desire to stay at Usuthu. "Coach (Jozef) Vukusic is assessing him having found a defensive gap. He believes Booysen could be a good player to help them not to concede easily."
