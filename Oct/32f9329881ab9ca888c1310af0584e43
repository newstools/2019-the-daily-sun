move down as if you’re going to sit on a chair behind you. -  Make sure your thighs are parallel to the floor.
Go down as far as you can until you can achieve a 90-degree angle with your
thighs. -  Keep your heels glued to the floor as you squat. -  Keep your knees in line with your toes. Make
sure your knees don’t pass your toes. -  Keep your torso straight and engage your core
muscles. Watch this video below that will show you how to squat correctly.
