GQOM artist Bhizer recently ruffled feathers by throwing shade at Mampintsha and Babes Wodumo. A video has been circulating in which he can be heard saying the pair’s song, Etshwaleni, is nonsense.  He said the song doesn’t make sense and he only heard it once before deleting it as it took up too much space on his phone. He said he’s not hating but just speaking the truth. Babes’ sister and manager, Nondumiso Simelane, told Daily Sun: “Is that person still around? We won’t comment on someone’s opinion. The last time he released anything was Gobisiqolo, so we don’t have a comment.” When called for comment, Bhizer, whose real name is Sibonelo Dimba, said he was not trying to make trouble.

He has his intentions.” Bhizer said he wouldn’t mind apologising to Babes and Mampintsha next time he runs into them. “I don’t want this to start some kind of beef between us because I respect them,” he said. #otshwaleni ????????????
