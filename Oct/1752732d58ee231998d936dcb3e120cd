Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said cops were on routine patrol in Edenvale when they noticed a suspicious man driving a truck on Linksfield Road. “As the police were approaching, the suspect allegedly got out of the truck and jumped into a nearby Toyota Rush with two occupants,” Peters said. Police gave chase as the suspects were driving onto the N3 highway.  The suspects allegedly started shooting at the police who then returned fire forcing the suspect's vehicle to a sudden halt. “Two suspects jumped out and fled on foot. One suspect was cornered and arrested while the other suspect evaded arrest,” Peters added.  The third suspect that was found inside the car was taken to hospital and is under police guard. The getaway car - the Toyota Rush, was fitted with false registration number plates.  Peters said an investigation is underway to establish if the vehicle could have been stolen. Car jammers and other car theft gear were found inside. Police are searching for the suspect that is still at large. The arrested suspects will appear at Edenvale Magistrates Court in due course, facing charges of attempted murder, possession of suspected stolen vehicle, reckless and negligent driving.
