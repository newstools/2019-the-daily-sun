WINEMAKER Siwela Masoga is among the young people who are pushing the boundaries in the wine industry. Her company, Siwela Wines, produces eight varieties that have been well-received in the local and international markets. Her collection includes Red, White, Rose, Sparkling and MCC. The 28-year-old, from Ga-Mphahlele, Limpopo, first toyed with the idea to start her own line of wines a few years ago and released it last year. “We started with four varieties, and decided to expand to eight this year. The aim is to cater to a wide customer base,” she said. According to Siwela, last weekend she was left speechless when her wines were sold out at the Stellenbosch Wine Festival at the Wanderers Club Cricket Fields, Joburg. “This was the first event we exhibited in and the support was overwhelming. This has encouraged us to do more.” Siwela, who completed a National Diploma in Biotechnology, majoring in fermentation and microbiology, is based in Cape Town where she has been exposed to the wine industry after scoring an internship at one of the province’s biggest wine makers. She also enrolled at the Cape Wine Academy to hone her skills. “This was an opportunity to learn more about the wine industry. At first, I was a bit reluctant, but am happy to have taken the leap of faith.” Siwela’s wish is to create a brand that speaks to the people. “I’ve registered a non-profit organisation, which will operate as a wine academy. I want to share the knowledge I acquired over the years with the youth to help them understand industry dynamics. “They should follow their passion until they find what really works for them.” Siwela hopes to launch her wines in Limpopo to give her people a chance to taste the fruits of her labour.
