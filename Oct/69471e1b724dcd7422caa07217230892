Dear MizzB I AM a 19-year-old varsity first- year student from a rural area. When I first got to varsity, everything was new and exciting and I wanted to belong.  My roommate took me out with his friends to party and I was introduced to alcohol. We drink every Thursday to Sunday, and this is interfering with my studies. I fear failing and wasting my parentsâ€™ money. Hi there People often are taken in by a new environment and people. But you have to see the danger of choosing this life and disappointing your parents, who sacrificed themselves to ensure you get an education. Take responsibility! There will always be booze and parties but not the opportunity for you to get an education, which some can only dream of. Realising this behaviour is wrong is the first step to recovery. Now you have to fight to get back full control of your life. This may mean sacrificing your friends. Choose to live right today so you may have a better future tomorrow.
