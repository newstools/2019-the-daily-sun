THE No Borders Exhibition is a month-long visual celebration of the work of Hugh Masekela. It started at the Soweto Theatre on Wednesday and will reach a climax on 9 November with the Hugh Masekela Heritage Festival. Adviser to the heritage foundation, Mabusha Masekela, said his uncle once said he wanted everyone to be able to experience his legacy.  Mabusha said people were welcome to go to Soweto Theatre from 10am to 5pm to enjoy the experience of the legendary trumpeter’s life. “The installation allows people to know more about Bra Hugh, who he was and what he was about. “The installations differ and some elements appear and reappear at the exhibition,” said Mabusha. “He referred to himself as a people’s person who always shared a piece of himself with everyone. That’s why Soweto Theatre was the ideal venue for the festival.” The exhibition includes one of the famous stories about Bra Hugh’s journey as a musician – when he received a trumpet from Louis Armstrong.

Mabusha said besides what the people knew of the maestro, there were other dimensions that showed the person he really was. “My uncle was well-read, which is why we had an installation at the Book Fair at Constitution Hill. This is the presentation of the legacy they couldn’t experience. We are happy at the amazing turnout,” he said.
