SUPERSPORT United defender Clayton Daniels says Mamelodi Sundowns winger Gaston Sirino should behave the next time the teams clash. Sirino vented out his frustration when his side lost 2-0 to Matsatsantsa A Pitori in the MTN8 semi-finals on 18 September by slapping Daniels and Dean Furman. But instead of giving the Uruguayan a red card, the referee was lenient by showing him a yellow card. Daniels revealed that instead of battling it out with Sirino he will head Pitso Mosimane’s call to take on big boys, Dennis Onyango and Wayne Arendse. “I believe that coach Pitso Mosimane want other deals, he want me to stand-up against Dennis Onyango and Wayne Arendse. I didn’t stand up against Sirino, he was standing up to me and I can’t help it if he is a small boy or small in structure. He didn’t have to do those things, I hope he learnt from it, we are professional players, I didn’t want to let my team down by going into the game with a different mind-set." The 35-year-old says he will smoke a peace pipe with Sirino to ensure he is calm on the pitch prior to their next meeting. “I have been looking out for him at Mall of Africa, I don’t see him there. I want to take a selfie with him maybe buy him a coffee just top cool him down a bit to relax so that when we go into the field we are sorted. Everything at his house will be okay, I think mine is okay with my MTN8 trophy."
