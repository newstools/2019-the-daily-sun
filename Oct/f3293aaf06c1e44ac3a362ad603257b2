READ: 'BUSHIRI OWES ME MONEY!" Hershel Fynn (18) was allegedly stabbed by a member of a school gang after confronting the group about the stabbing of a girl in the school on Monday. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said he would ensure enough police were dispatched to the school and to the area. Counselling would be provided. “The situation forced them to close the school on Wednesday as it would have been impossible to allow pupils to continue learning,” said Mshengu. He said 26 grade 12 pupils who were going to write computer application technology were moved to Alexandra High School, where they’d write under police guard. Mshengu extended his condolences to Hershel’s family. READ: I DANCE NAKED FOR MONEY! A pupil said the attacks were a result of “bombing” incidents. This is when older pupils bomb younger ones with condoms filled with kak, sewage water and rotten eggs. “Both stabbings and bombings are an old practice and we’re always fearful,” said the pupil. Brigadier Jay Naicker said cases of murder and attempted murder were opened at Mountain Rise Police Station after two groups of pupils were involved in a fight on Tuesday. “Mountain Rise police are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the incidents,” said Naicker.
