I guess it is safe to say the VRR
PHA! phrase was coined specifically for the Golf R or GTI DSG versions. The phrase came about when car enthusiasts
began describing the sound it makes when upshifting and at the time it was the Golf 5. More than anything buyers always
opted for the DSG equipped Golf GTI or R purely for the noise it produces. The performance brand Volkswagen R
represents the sportiest models in the Volkswagen portfolio. Volkswagen R have been known to offer
performance and comfort all at the same, which has made it the iconic loved
performance brand. This division is introducing a change
with the new R logo. “Volkswagen R is all about excitement
and thrill, and in the future, we will continue to focus our efforts on
integrating these emotions into the Volkswagen brand. We are taking a strategic
and operative approach to working on great products and creating a unique
customer experience,” Managing Director of Volkswagen R, Jost Capito said. In a statement, Capito said the new R
logo symbolizes the performance brand’s fresh start. According to VW the new design is
more modern, distinct and sleek. The new company logo is characterized
by the pristine line width and a clearly horizontal arrangement featuring
dynamic curves. The elongated R creates a broader,
more powerful impression and defines Volkswagen’s commitment to performance and
exclusivity. Capito emphasized that: “The new logo
for the R models and the R-Lines also goes hand in hand with the realignment of
the Volkswagen R brand. “Our entire team is intensely working
on the brand and product image and we are looking forward to continuing to roll
these out in the coming months.”
