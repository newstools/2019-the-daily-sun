The
Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) launched an investigation
into the shooting of two KwaZulu-Natal police officers who were accused of
robbing a post office. "IPID
are currently at the scene. This is a developing story. Nobody is arrested
(sic)," IPID spokesperson Sontaga Seisa said on Thursday. According
to police, the officers – a male sergeant and female constable – were spotted
by a team that included the Hawks, National Intervention Unit and others while
conducting operations in the area. At around
02:30, the team was on the road between Greytown and Dalton when they spotted a
police patrol vehicle approaching. When the
team tried to flag them down, the sergeant in the patrol vehicle allegedly
opened fire on the team. They returned fire and both officers in the patrol
vehicle were killed. An angle
grinder, jackhammer, ink-stained cash and other items were found inside the
patrol vehicle. Police say
it is believed that they were stolen from the Dalton post office. Seisa said
IPID received a report of police action that resulted in death after "two
alleged robbers were shot and killed". "The
information is that National Intervention Unit members were responding to an
imminent armed robbery in the area when [the] shooting ensued between the
robbers and the police which resulted in the death of two 'police
robbers'." The names
of the officers have not yet been released, but Seisa said the woman was aged
33 and the man was 40 years old. SOURCE:
