DEPUTY minister in the presidency Thembi Siweya and deputy home affairs minister, Njabulo Nzuza, visited the border between KZN and Mozambique on Friday. The visit to Gate 6 border post in Umhlabuyalingana was aimed at monitoring service delivery progress and whether safety measures were being implemented. Siweya said they were told there was a market day every Wednesday and Saturday where citizens of Mozambique and South Africa did business. “We support the trading, as long as they trade legal things. This trading helps many people put food on the table,” she said. “The only worry that comes up is that moving in and out of South Africa without legal documentation is against the law and a serious offence. People who need to come in the country should have proper documents and border security needs to ensure that.” Siweya said the trading would allow Mzansi to build a strong relationship with Mozambique. “The relationship seems to be good, as no major incidents have been reported during these market days,” she said.
