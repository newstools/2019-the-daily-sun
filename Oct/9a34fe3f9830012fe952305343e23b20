Nigeria's football federation (NFF) said on Friday that Swede Thomas Dennerby has resigned as coach of the national women's team. Dennerby, who still had a year left on his contract, led Nigeria to the Round of 16 at this year's FIFA Women's World Cup after winning the Africa Women Cup of Nations last year. "We have received his resignation letter and of course, he has a right to resign from a job," the NFF said on Twitter. He has alleged he did not receive enough support from his employers to do his work and that there were several breaches of his contract including unpaid wages. The NFF have rejected these claims. Federation committee member Ibrahim Guasau said the country will look for a replacement for Dennerby after Chris Danjuma was appointed in an interim capacity. -AFP
