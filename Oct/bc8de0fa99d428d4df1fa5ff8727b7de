PIET Retief taxi drivers in Mpumalanga are angry with cops. This after three people, including a cop, died on Saturday. According to a taxi driver, residents assaulted a man who allegedly targeted old people and raped them. The man was attacked near the taxi rank and police were called. “We heard gunshots and one of our colleagues found people lying down and others dispersing. He tried to help the injured, but it was too late,” he said. Another taxi driver said: “Police in this area have failed us many times. They don’t take us seriously and treat us like enemies. Instead of arresting drug dealers, murderers and rapists, they go for drunk people. Even if we help them by showing them suspects, they don’t co-operate.” He said on Sunday, taximen caught a man who had drugs and took him to the cop shop but he was later seen roaming the streets. “We’re not going to allow such things. If cops don’t want to work with us to fight crime, then it’s a problem for society.” Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said if someone was seen on the streets after being taken to the cop shop, people should ask about it instead of taking the law into their own hands. He said no one’s been bust for the three murders.
