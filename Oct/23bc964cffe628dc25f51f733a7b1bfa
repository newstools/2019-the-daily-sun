Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus said the "X-factor" Cobus Reinach was a chip off the old block as the Springbok scrumhalf scored the quickest World Cup hat-trick in a 66-7 rout of Canada in Kobe on Tuesday. Reinach, son of late South Africa wing Jaco Reinach, took just 11 minutes to score three tries in a first half where the two time world champion Springboks scored seven of their 10 in the match. Reinach, whose treble was faster than Australia fullback Chris Latham's 25-minute hat-trick against Namibia at the 2003 World Cup, is widely regarded as the third choice scrumhalf in the Springboks' squad behind Faf de Klerk and Herschel Jantjies. His first try in particular was a fine example of Reinach's quality, a searing break followed by a chip over the top and regather before he sprinted clear."Everybody knows he has the X-factor - I knew his Dad well," said Erasmus. "He's got exceptional speed, he hasn't had a lot of game time with us since I've been coach, but he's got good speed and anticipation."We're lucky to have three quality nines at a World Cup."While the Springboks have all but booked their place in the last eight, the identity of their quarter-final opponents from a tightly-contested Pool A remains far from clear.South Africa could find themselves up against one of Japan, Ireland or Scotland in Oita on October 20 depending upon the outcome of this weekend's matches.Japan famously stunned the Springboks 34-32 at the 2015 World Cup in England although South Africa hammered them 41-7 in a warm-up match for this edition in September.
