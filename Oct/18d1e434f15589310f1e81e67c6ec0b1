With only less than a year of existence, Bonang Matheba’s House of BNG bubble drink is making major moves. As always she keeps turning heads for all the right reasons as her champagne has been announced as the official partner of the 2020 Sun Met which takes place next year in Cape Town. This international award winning influencer and style icon,  is the first black woman to partner with Sun Met and follows hot on the heels of international brand, GH Mumm and J&B which were former partners and drinks of choice at the prestigious horse racing events. She announced her partnership on Tuesday night across her social media platforms and she is also the face of the 2020 Sun Met alongside current reigning Miss SA, Zozibini Tunzi. Bonang, who gave away forty cases of her sparkling champagne at Somizi’s wedding this past weekend, has ensured that her brand becomes a household brand that is the most marketed in Mzansi thus far.
