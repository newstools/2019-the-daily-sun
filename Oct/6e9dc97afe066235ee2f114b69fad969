LOCAL musician Samthing Soweto broke the South African Apple Music record for the highest number of users “pre-adding” his brand-new solo album Isphithiphithi to their personal libraries. According to Apple Music, “a ‘pre-add’ occurs when an Apple Music subscriber registers their interest in a full album ahead of its release”. The South African record was previously held by American performer Billie Eilish. Samthing’s album was officially launched on 20 September. About the record-breaking achievement, Samthing (real name Samkelo Dolomba) said in a press statement: “I’m surprised and excited. I didn’t know there was another record to be broken, which is a great feat for me. “I thank all my fans for being so supportive and loyal.” Samthing was one of the founding members of The Soil. He then went solo and topped the charts with his single Akanamali and won three Samas in 2018. – News24
