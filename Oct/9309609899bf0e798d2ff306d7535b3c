PEOPLE are so in love with their phones that it’s giving them a pain in the backside! They’re spending so much time playing with them while sitting on the toilet seat that it can cause serious problems. Doctor Octavia Lucas from Joburg told Daily Sun scrolling is bad for your butt as it increases the risk of having piles. Piles, also known as haemorrhoids, are swollen veins in the lower part of the bum. “The problem isn’t the phone, it’s sitting on the toilet that causes the trouble,” she said. She said while sitting on the toilet people tend to push while nothing is coming out. She said people should leave their phones outside the toilet. “Go, do your business and finish.” Mdumiseni Zwane (32) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun he stayed in the toilet longer than he should when he is at work. Asked if he suffers from piles, he said: “Oh, yes! I thought it was the chillies but it’s not.” On the Daily Sun website, Chris said he spent three to four hours in a public toilet. “The Wi-Fi signal is strong and free,” he said. Lebohang said: “I can read all the stories in Daily Sun while sitting on the toilet.” Manana said: “It’s true. I used to spend more than 10 minutes and I suffered from piles.” Elias said: “I happen to be reading this story while sitting on the toilet, and it’s been 20 minutes already!”
