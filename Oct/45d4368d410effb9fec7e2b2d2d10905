INKOSI Mangosuthu Buthelezi’s daughter, Princess Phumzile has lashed out at IFP leaders for spreading lies about him remarrying. Phumzile was reacting to a Facebook photo of her dad talking closely to a woman, described as the granddaughter of ANC Youth League founding president Anton Lembede. The photo was captioned: “The man doesn’t get old for marriage. Wedding bells are ringing for Buthelezi and he will tie the knot soon. Money is an issue, would you not have taken this opportunity?” Yesterday, Phumzile told Daily Sun it was not true her dad planned to marry. “Someone who posted this picture wanted to stain his image. There are people in the party who wish him dead, but I don’t know why.” She said Buthelezi had no plans to remarry after he lost his wife last year. “This lady was introduced to me by a party member during a mini Shaka’s Day celebration in Hlabisa a few weeks back. “The member asked me to introduce her to Inkosi Buthelezi. I took her to my father and he told her the history of her grandfather while they were in the youth league together.” The photo was discussed by Facebook group, Ladies House. Some congratulated Buthelezi, while others were concerned whether he could still poke. Attempts to get hold of the Lembede family failed. But IFP spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa accused Daily Sun of being insensitive to Buthelezi, who is still mourning his wife’s death.
