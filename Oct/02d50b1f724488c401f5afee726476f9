October is breast cancer month and as part of the campaign against breast cancer month, SABC TV and Radio Sports presenter Lebohang Mortsoeli has bared it all. While most celebrities are up in arms fighting for money, the sports presenter is fighting for a good course. Lebo recently posted a video on Twitter, in which she is encouraging women to check for breast cancer so it is detected earlier. The star while raising awareness went naked, asking women to check breast cancer early, so that should it be detected and they can get help they need.
