VILLAGERS are struggling with stomach bugs, while children are battling with skin rashes. But their biggest fear is someone dying from drinking contaminated sewage water from Chumnce River in Buntingville Village, Ngqeleni. The sewage leaks directly from a sewer station into Ndamase High School, about a kilometre away from the river. Villagers said they were provided with water tanks in 2004, but these stopped in 2013. Nokulunga Qanda (62) said she was recently taken to a doctor after she got yet another stomach bug. “I can still feel the pain in my stomach, which was caused by the sewage water. I was given lots of pills, but my health has not been normal,” she said. According to the villagers, the water is green and stinks.  Thelma Hlaza (63) said they had to boil the water before drinking it.  Speaking on behalf of OR Tambo Municipality, Bongani Matomela said they were aware of the sewage problem. “Our team was there on Friday to do an assessment of how many water tanks will be needed. Water will then be delivered to the tanks,” he promised. Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima added that they procured the services of a service provider to fix the leakage. “The first phase has been done. We are busy with the second phase to ensure the ablution facilities become functional,” he said.
