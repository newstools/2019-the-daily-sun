IF you were thinking of bringing smart devices into exam centers, you may have to reconsider that as invigilators will be monitoring those closely to prevent cheating. Ear pods, smart watches and smart wrist bangles are some of electronics that will not be allowed in exam centers as learns might use them to compromise exams.  On Sunday, during a media briefing Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said in preparation for the conduct of the examinations, chief invigilators and invigilators for all examination centers have been officially appointed and trained. He was giving an update on the department’s readiness on the upcoming 2019 National Senior Certificate examinations. He said the invigilators training was not only limited to check if the learners are exchanging information amongst themselves during exams, but also monitor the new devices that learners may bring into exam rooms. The new flashy and trendy ear pods, smart watches and bangles are some of the devices that will not be allowed in exam rooms. Lesufi said, “It is important to train all our invigilators because with technology, you know we’ve got watches now that that learners bring and some of them are not innocent. “You can google things and get messages from your watch.“Gone are the days where you just invigilate by walking around the wall,” he said. The following points were also discussed during the briefing:   The Gauteng province will commence the year-end National
Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations with the administration of the Computer
Applications Technology Practical examination on 16 October 2019 and conclude
with Music on 29 November 2019. Lesufi said the results will be released on 3 January
2020.
