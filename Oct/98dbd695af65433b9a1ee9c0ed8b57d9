THE DA’s federal executive has asked to see a review panel’s findings on the state of the party before the document is tabled at the federal council meeting next week. It’s understood a number of Mmusi Maimane supporters believe this will give them an advantage. Maimane has been faced with increasing pressure since the party’s poor performance during the national and provincial elections. The party failed to grow its support, although it did manage to hold onto control of the Western Cape. The DA leader has faced questions and criticism over his use of a car hired by disgraced former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste and over why he declared a R4 million home in parliament’s assets registry, despite not owning the property. Former leader Helen Zille will be referred to the executive council about her controversial “black privilege” tweet, while two MPs will be subjected to internal processes after controversial tweets. A provincial leader said senior members had the right to see the review and discuss its findings and recommendations before a larger structure saw them. “In a company where resizing or restructuring has to happen, the findings and plans on how this will be done start with board members. We’re the board members in the DA,” said the leader. Some insiders believe this move could assist Maimane in strengthening his own hand and dealing with those who want to use the report against him. Maimane’s supporters have raised concerns over the actions of former party leader Tony Leon, one of the people on the review panel. The Sunday Times revealed Leon was part of a delegation which met Maimane, asking him to consider resigning in the interests of the party. National spokesman Solly Malatsi confirmed a request was made for the executive to see the report first. – NEWS24
