POLITICAL leaders showed sympathy for former DA leader Mmusi Maimane after his resignation on Wednesday. At first, Maimane said he would continue to lead the party in Parliament, but yesterday he changed his mind and resigned as an MP as well. Responding to Maimane’s tweet announcing his resignation from Parliament, EFF leader Julius Malema wrote: “I’m not home but when I come back we should have lenakana la monna wa mosepidi. You are a good human being, don’t be discouraged, my big brother.” IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa quoted Ecclesiastes 10:4, which says: “If a ruler’s anger rises against you do not leave your post, calmness can lay great offences to the rest”. However, GOOD leader, Patricia de Lille was not as kind. She wrote: “Mmusi Maimane gets a taste of his own medicine.” She said she warned him last year that if he didn’t stand by his principles, certain groups in the party would swallow him up and spit him out. Maimane first joined the DA 10 years ago, as part of a group of young black people who left the ANC. In March 2011, he was announced as the party’s mayoral candidate for Joburg. In May 2015, he became party leader. He made headlines with his speech at the 2015 state of the nation address by then president Jacob Zuma. He said in the speech: “For you, honourable president, are not an honourable man. You are a broken man presiding over a broken society.”
