The chap on the left is Anthony Laffor, a dribbling wizard
for Mamelodi Sundowns and a feared soccer player in the PSL – while the other
one is world renowned international House Music DJ Black Coffee. Both are trailblazers in their careers but their striking
resemblance has left many wondering if they could have been brothers. They spot
a similar look ­- shiny chiskop and that Isaac Hayes beard style. Black Coffee has taken the SA and International House Music
scene by storm. Born Nathi Maphumulo, the lanky DJ in rubbing shoulders with
some of the best musicians and disk jockeys in the world. Laffor continues to score important goals for Masandawana
and his dribbling tricks have left many defenders flat on their buttocks. Nicknamed “Sika Lekhekhe”, Laffor is also an important
player for the Liberia national team and is very famous in his home country. Do you agree that they have a striking resemblance?
