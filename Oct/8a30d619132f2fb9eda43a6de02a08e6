MARITZBURG United coach Eric Tinkler says his side still lack confidence despite winning three successive matches in all competitions. Tinkler made this statement after his side beat Bidvest Wits 3-1 on penalties in their Telkom Knockout last-16 clash at Harry Gwala Stadium at the weekend. The game ended 1-1 after extra time. “I’m very happy for the club to go through. But this team needs confidence,”admitted Tinkler. “I can try and motivate as much as I like, I can tell them how good they really are, but the harsh reality is there’s got to be self-belief, and there’s also got to be self-motivation. “The only way that is going to happen is when the team start winning the way I want.” “Although we have played the last three games and won, the fact is we haven’t played well,” Tinkler said. “In fact, our first four league games (that Maritzburg didn’t win) we played exceptionally well, yet we lost (some). I thought Wits were the better team.”
