SHE’S 15 and pregnant – and she doesn’t know what she’s going to do. “I don’t know how to raise a baby,” the grade 8 girl told Daily Sun. And she’s not the only one. The girl from Setlagole Village, North West, is one of 6 000 young girls in 24 villages in the province reported to be pregnant or have recently become mothers. These statistics were released at the children’s parliament in the North West legislature last month. The 15-year-old girl lives in the village’s Lokaleng section, notorious for its high teen pregnancy rate. She dropped out of school because her uniform couldn’t fit her anymore. She can’t remember who made her pregnant, but thinks it might be a 16-year-old boy she was dating. She didn’t say if she slept with boys other than her boyfriend. Her mum is very angry. “I don’t know what to do,” the mother said. Their neighbour’s daughter is also 15 and pregnant. Her gogo blamed the girl’s mum for leaving her with the child. “I’m very old. I couldn’t make sure she didn’t do anything naughty,” said the 72-year-old gogo. The grade 7 pupil said she dropped out of school because other pregnant girls did the same. She said of her boyfriend: “We were in the same grade. He’s still attending school,” she said. North West Education Department spokesman Elias Malindi said pregnant pupils could return to school after giving birth. Pupil support agents had been appointed to ensure they returned to school. He said teen mums were also helped to catch up on the work they missed on during their time away. He said the department would continue to engage communities on teenage pregnancy and ways to support teen mums.
