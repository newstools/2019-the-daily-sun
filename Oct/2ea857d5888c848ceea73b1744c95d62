ANOTHER prominent prophet faces a rape charge. According to the victim, who agreed to be identified, the man of God not only raped her but also cursed her punani with muthi. Angel Ntombela said she was raped in May and the prophet, based in Tshwane, threatened her to keep it quiet. The nail technician from Arcadia in Tshwane said: “He told me if I told anyone, including my husband, I’d suffer.” Angel (31) opened a case last week. She claimed creatures, some with nails, soon started coming out of her punani! The SunTeam saw photos of the alleged creatures and screenshots of messages from the prophet. In one of them, he asked her to send him a video of her masturbating. She said the trouble started after she started serving as an usher in the church. “The prophet started telling me how much he wanted and loved me. He’d ask me to send him sexy pictures and videos, and I refused,” she said. Angel said on the day of the rape, the prophet invited her for a prayer session. “He took me to a scary bush lodge. I told him I wasn’t comfortable but he offered me a cold drink. He told me to trust him and follow him to the prayer session. “I followed him to a room, and when we walked in he forced himself on me. “My vision suddenly became blurry and he penetrated me. He later forced me to take a bath.” Angel said she was consulting another prophet to help her get rid of the creatures. Her husband Peter said: “The things coming out of her private parts are very bad. At times, I help her remove them because she is my wife and I love her.” Captain Mohlaume Mamabolo said a case of rape was opened at Midrand Police Station. No arrest has been made.
