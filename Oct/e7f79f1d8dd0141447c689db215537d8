As a child, Bukamina was so shy she would hide behind her mum until she felt comfortable to show her face in front of strangers. But today, the charming Bukamina Cebekhulu (33) from Ndabayakhe Village in Empangeni, KZN, is confident and has a positive attitude. Her social skills and her spirit are obvious in her role of Gugu in Muvhango. Gugu was introduced as Imani’s cousin who would help bring Imani back from Nigeria. “Gugu was supposed to be on screen for only three months but viewers loved her so much she has stayed.” Bukamina’s talent is obvious but her trademark chiskop makes her a favourite. “I’m proud of myself and I’m not scared of being me. I treat hair as a prop and cut my hair to suit the character. The producers were looking for a special look because the character is a bold person. They tried me without hair. It has been three years now and I love it. It shows my face.” Bukamina said she shared the same qualities with Gugu because they were both picky. “I like men who have respect, and Gugu looks for confidence and ambition.” The actress studied live performance and motion picture acting at Afda and she’s also a singer. “My first love has always been acting but I needed a job, so I worked at ATTV as a secretary. After three months I moved into production as an assistant. I was also a production co-ordinator for Gospel Classics before I joined Uzalo.” She was a production co-o-rdinator for The Lion King in 2016. “I was also a floor manager for the Words are Numbers show for three years. Working behind the scenes teaches you respect,” said Bukamina. She said young people must be proud of where they come from. “I’m a village girl and was born to hardworking parents. My father Mandlenkosi is a bus driver and my mum Thulakele takes care of the household. Young people must dream their dreams and make them come true,” she said.
