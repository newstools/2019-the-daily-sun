GOGO Funeka Sonqwelo (70) from Nyanga is now a happy woman! Her life became a lot better after the City of Cape Town stopped sending her inexplicable water bills. The sky-high bills have been giving her sleepless nights for a long time. Three months ago, Daily Sun visited the gogo in her shack. She showed the SunTeam the water bills she was receiving every month.  “Since the story appeared in the People’s Paper, the bills have stopped,” said gogo. “The letters were stressing me out. I was even struggling to sleep. But now all that is in the past.” The amount the city wanted her to pay was R15 289,58.

Now I’ve seen it for myself.” She also said the city should ensure it didn’t make the same mistake with other people. “I’m sure there are other people who were receiving these letters. The city is more worried about money than us,” said gogo. “They could have visited me to show that they were sorry.”
