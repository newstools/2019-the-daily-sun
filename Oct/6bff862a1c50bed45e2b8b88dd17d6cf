The league’s Sedibeng regional structure spokesman, Thabiso Hlongwane, called on law enforcement agencies  to take action against those responsible for the leak. He said the league was unhappy over Se loa n e’s attitude towards the video after Seloane said he didn’t owe anyone  a  n explanation. S  aid Hlongwane: “His utterances are not only irresponsi ble but a display of arrogance of the highest order. “He must voluntarily vacate his position by resigning, failing which the  ANC must institute the necessary proceedings to have him removed.” But Seloane told  Daily Sun : “If there’s anything you need to discuss about the video, call the speaker of the house.” DA Emfuleni central constituencyhead Dady Mollo called on the ANC to recall Seloane. “According to the Municipal  Systems Act, a councillor must perform the functions of the office he serves in good faith, honesty and in a t ransparent manner,” said Mollo. “Councillor Seloane has compromised the integrity of the Em fuleni Municipality.”
