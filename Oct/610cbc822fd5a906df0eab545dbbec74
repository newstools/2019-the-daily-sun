SEVERAL families were left homeless after a raging fire burnt down their shacks on Monday. About 16 households in Mayville, Durban, were left stranded after the fire. Residents told Daily Sun they didn’t know what started the blaze, but it spread very quickly. Although everyone managed to escape unharmed, they lost clothes, food, furniture, IDs and birth certificates. Muzi Msani (34) said he was lying on his bed in his two-roomed shack when he heard people shouting there was a fire.  “The flames were big and I couldn’t save anything from my shack. I don’t know where I’ll get the money to replace my things as I’m unemployed,” he said. Nompilo Majoka (55) said she was in her neighbour’s shack when the fire started. “I had left my two grandchildren in my shack, and when I saw the flames I shouted at them to come out. They escaped unharmed.” She said residents helped kill the fire. “If residents didn’t assist with water, maybe more shacks would have burnt.” Nompilo said she and her grandchildren were only left with the clothes on their backs. Councillor Mveli Mthembu said: “I arranged for disaster management to assist the affected families.”
