Losing Amani's ashes in this fire from hell has got to be the greatest lesson of letting go I could ever have had to experience. What a humbling life this is... one thing I know more than anything though is that God and my angels are protecting me and my family at all times and for that I am forever grateful. Goodbye Amani-Amaza ?. A post shared by  Mona Skenjana (@monamonyane) on Oct 22, 2019 at 2:23am PDT
