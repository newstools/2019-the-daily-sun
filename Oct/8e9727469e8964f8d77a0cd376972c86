 UTatakho hitmaker Yanga Chief held a listening
session at Zio La Famigla for his EP BAPS (Becoming A Pop Star) that he will be
released in all digital today. The
guests were his friends that he has known since he came to Joburg and allowed
him to find himself in the entertainment industry. Coming to Joburg to live his dream,
he has found himself working with the likes of Slikour, Shuga Smakx, Kwesta,
Kid X and Zingha in music and behind the scene shooting music videos. He said it was crazy that a day
before he turns 32 he released what is known as his first body of work even
though he’s been in the hip-hop scene for a while. The nine-track EP that has hits
like uTatakho, uTatakho Remix, Soweto and Lovey
is a taste of what his album will sound like. “I would like to thank everyone
who came here because at first I didn’t believe in the concept of friends but
here I am with an amazing group of people. The best present will be you guys
purchasing my EP on Friday,” he said.
