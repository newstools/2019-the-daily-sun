“I’VE read about women being killed by their partners, but never thought my daughter would be one of them.” These were the words of Zolile Mtimkulu, whose daughter Nandipha (24) was allegedly killed by her boyfriend. The 57-year-old dad from Strand in Cape Town said the family still couldn’t believe Nandipha’s no more. Zolile said Nandipha was visiting her boyfriend when she met her death. Zolile said one of the boyfriend’s neighbours told them on Sunday morning that Nandipha was killed. “At first we thought she was bluffing because we spoke to Nandipha the day before.” He said neighbours found Nandipha’s body after they heard her one-month-old baby crying non-stop. “The people who saw her body told us her private part and one ear were cut off. “I couldn’t see her body in the mortuary as they told me they were still busy with it,” he said. “I was told she also had stab wounds and neighbours heard them fight before she was killed.” Zolile wants his daughter’s killer to rot in jail. Police spokesman Captain FC Van Wyk said a 31-year-old suspect was arrested.
