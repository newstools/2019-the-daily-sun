The debate over which of Ronaldo and Messi is the better has raged over the years, with both superstars enjoying glittering careers. Lionel Messi has aimed a thinly-veiled dig at rival Cristiano Ronaldo after claiming he doesn't need to boast about his personal success - because he knows he is one of the world's best players. The debate over which of Ronaldo and Messi is the better has raged over the years, with both superstars enjoying glittering careers.  While Ronaldo enjoyed an impressive debut season with Juventus in 2018/19, Messi produced another remarkable campaign as he netted 51 goals in all competitions for Barcelona, passing the half-century mark for the sixth time in his career. But, despite his goalscoring prowess, Messi says that he doesn't need to shout about his achievements like Ronaldo or former Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. In a rare interview, Messi was quoted by Mirror : "I'd rather people talk about me. I know what I am, what I did and what I can give, but I keep it to myself. People can have their say. I don't like to talk about myself, I like to talk about the collective." Messi has endured an injury-hit start to this season, managing just five appearances in all competitions for the Spanish giants so far.
