WESTERN Cape Transport MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela wants to help end road deaths. Madikizela on Monday launched a road safety plan following deaths and injuries caused by drinking and driving. He said: “Motorists who plan to attend music and cultural festivals, trance parties and sports events must make alternative travel arrangements to avoid drinking and driving.” He warned there would soon be many traffic cops on the roads. “Random breathing testing teams will operate anywhere, anytime,” he said. “If you drink and drive you’ll be caught and tested in a mobile evidentiary alcohol unit. “If you’re over the limit, you’ll be arrested, fined and your licence suspended.” A new unit will focus on high-risk activities on highways. At the launch, Madikizela and department officials unveiled vehicles that will be part of the operation. Madikizela said he was concerned at the number of deaths on the province’s roads. “More than 1 300 people are killed on Western Cape roads every year,” he said. “Alcohol is involved in at least 60% of these deaths. “Drinking and driving doesn’t just rob families of loved ones. “It has a negative impact on the economy.”
