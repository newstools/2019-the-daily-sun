Outspoken Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has never fought with now Orlando Pirates up and coming coach Rhulani Mokweni – it was Social Media that got the two into loggerheads. Twitter users alleged that Mokwena was the brains behind Sundowns’ success in the PSL and that he also masterminded the Brazilians triumph when they won the CAF Champions League in 2016.  This was fuelled by a Tweet from former Sundowns star Bongani Zungu who praised Mokwena. The Tweet was misinterpreted as saying that Mokwena was the man in charge and not Mosimane. SA coach and legend Benni McCarthy reprimanded Zungu, saying he was disrespectful to Mosimane. Zungu later apologised. Both Mosimane and Mokwena remained matured about the saga but it was the supporters and social media users that dragged the matter out of proportion. Even today, the supporters are still hanging on to the matter. Yesterday, at the Telkom Knockout press conference, Mosimane said he was proud to have contributed in the growth of coaches such as Mokwena and Kaitano Tembo. Mokwena patted the Sundowns coach on the back and said he was grateful to Mosimane for giving him the opportunity to become a top coach in the country.
