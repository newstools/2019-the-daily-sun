JUST a day after he was granted bail, an accused allegedly went back to his victim’s house and stole meat to braai in the bush. The 36-year-old man appeared in the Seshego Magistrates Court, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, on Friday. He’s facing nine charges including arson, theft and housebreaking.  On Saturday, he allegedly broke into the home of Bishop Mmetlwa Mathobela of the St John Apostolic Church and stole a plasma screen TV, groceries, money and meat. “I was at a church conference when neighbours called to say there were suspicious movements in my house. When I got there I found a window broken,” he said. “The suspect was later found braaing the meat in the bush.” COP BUST FOR STOLEN MEAT! He was caught by residents the following day. They assaulted him until cops came to his rescue and took him to hospital. Mathobela said the man was a relative. Three weeks ago, the suspect allegedly burnt the bishop’s car and a shack. Police said the suspect would appear in court as soon as he had recovered.
