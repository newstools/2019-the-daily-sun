UMALUSI said it won’t give school leaving certificates to grade 9 pupils unless they’re going to a training college. CEO Mafu Rakometsi said: “They must not think they have arrived. They actually haven’t.

Speaking about the upcoming matric exams, Ramoketsi said Umalusi was ready and they’d start on the 23rd with English paper 1 and end on the 28th of next month with agricultural technology and design. This year, 751 668 candidates will write the exams, 40 000 fewer than last year, at 6 900 centres across the country. The Independent Exam Board has registered 11 839 candidates in total. Meanwhile, basic education department director general Hubert Mweli told Parliament’s portfolio committee on basic education that the number of school drop-outs in the country was exaggerated.

That’s not true,” he said. Mweli told MPs the department was ready for the final matric exams and they were expected to go smoothly. Questioning Mweli on the issue of repitition, DA MP Nomsa Marchesi asked: “What’s the actual repitition rate from grade 1 to grade 12 and what is an acceptable rate per class?” Mweli said a presentation due to be made to the committee next week would address these questions.
