AN investigation into alleged financial wrongdoing by DA leader Mmusi Maimane has cleared him late on Friday. But Mzansi Black Twitter has warned him to watch his back. This comes after DA MP and federal finance chairperson Dion George cleared Maimane of financial wrongdoing for his controversial living arrangements in Cape Town. This and a controversial Toyota Fortuner donated to him by the embattled Markus Jooste of Steinhoff. George said documents submitted by Maimane showed he paid a R450 000 deposit to rent the house and R18 400 for rent every month. This despite having no documented formal lease agreement. But from the goings-on in the party, internally, itâ€™s clear there are members who want him out and Harvard University is waiting in the wings for him. Word of advice: consult with Lindiwe Mazibuko while you can.
