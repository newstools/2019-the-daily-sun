THERE was a joint operation in Matholesville, Roodepoort, on Monday targeting zama zamas. But residents heard gunshots before cops arrived and then seven zama zamas were dead. The shootings were allegedly over territory. Residents said they had been fearing for their lives for a long time.   Nokwazi Mlambo (41) said: “We’ve been alerting cops, but they did nothing. I don’t know why they took so long to act.” Joburg Metro police spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun four zama zamas were bust.

He said they’d continue with the operations as zamas zama put innocent lives in danger.
