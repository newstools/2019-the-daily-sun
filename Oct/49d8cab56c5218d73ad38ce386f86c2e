BONGINKOSI Sibiya (48) took his own life on Sunday and didn’t even leave a suicide note. His family believe he killed himself because his baby mama left him last year. Sibiya was found hanging from the ceiling of his bedroom in Hlabisa, northern KZN, by a relative.  His sister Samkelisiwe (41) said the family was woken up by screams. “I woke up and rushed to the room,” she said. “I couldn’t believe it when I walked in and saw him hanging. “He hanged himself with a washing line rope.” Semkelisiwe said her brother was deeply hurt when his baby mama dumped him. “She left him because he had another woman in his life,” she said. “Since she left him, he had been very unhappy. “A few months ago, when he was drunk, he took a rope and threatened to kill himself. We had to stop him.” Samkelisiwe said at the time of his suicide, her brother was not drunk and had not even mentioned his ex. “This is very confusing to us. Maybe it would have been better if he left a note to explain,” she said. “The whole family is hurt. We’re still going to ask his friends. Maybe they know something.” Samkelisiwe said Bonginkosi was unemployed and lived with his sisters, brothers and mother. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said an inquest docket was opened.
