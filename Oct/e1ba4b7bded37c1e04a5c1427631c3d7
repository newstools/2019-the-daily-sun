Gogo Dineo Ndlanzi said she was blessed by mkhulu Gejan’insizwa ka Shabalala with ancestral powers. But she never wanted to associate herself with amadlozi. She grew up in a Christian family that stopped following traditional customs after her granddad died when she was 12. But then everything, from her relationships to her jobs, took a downward turn. “I started hearing voices. “We looked for help and I discovered I was chosen to do the work of my ancestors,” she said.   Gogo Dineo, who grew up in Alex, north of Joburg, told Daily Sun accepting her calling was the best thing she did for herself. “I have no regrets whatsoever.

She completed her training in 2011 and only started initiating amathwasa in 2016. “As healers, we need to understand our job is to heal and having spiritual children is a bonus,” she said. “Some people don’t understand that and want to be gobelas a few months after completing training.”   She said not everyone was meant to be a gobela. Gogo Dineo said a lot of negativity surrounded izangoma, and she was working hard to bring the light back into their craft. She said a lot people assumed she was a celebrity gobela, but this was not the case. “I’ve never initiated any celebrities, but many of them are my clients because I’ve been helping them for years. There’s nothing to be ashamed of,” she said. “If people can go to Western doctors for healing, why can’t others use muthi?” Gogo Dineo has posted images of herself with her celeb clients and friends such as Somizi Mhlongo, Boity, Masechaba Ndlovu and Baby Cele among others on social media.
