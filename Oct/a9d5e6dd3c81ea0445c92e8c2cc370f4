CALLS for mineral resources and energy minister Gwede Mantashe to be held accountable for his alleged bribery admission scandal, keep growing. Sanef and the DA are amongst those who say Mantashe should be held responsible. This comes after the minister admitted that he paid off two Sunday World journalists R70 000 to kill a story involving his affair with SunBabe Lerato Makgatho. Following the article, social media was on fire with news of Lerato Makgatho’s alleged affairs involving government ministers. Lerato was allegedly romantically involved with both Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe. SUNBABE IS A SLAY QUEEN IN GWEDE'S BED! She described Mantashe as a tiger in bed and said Mboweni switched off the lights when it was poking time. No the 26-year-old from Winterveld, Tshwane, took to facebook to defend Mantashe. She wrote: “Sunday World it is one thing to do a story about us but it is another thing when you want to allow a minister to lose his position. Your story has been turned into political plot to bring the ANC down. If anything bad happens to me- it is in your hands. This is not journalism.” I another post the SunBabe wrote: “no journalist was paid and I will not allow myself to be used by ANC enemies to bring the party down.”
