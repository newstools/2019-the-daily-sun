A Durban man's life has been turned upside down. Sandile Mkhize was preparing to get married fours years ago when he found out that he was legally married to his mum! According to Drum, which qouted Sandile in an Isolezwe interview, the 38 year-old received the shocking news from Home Affairs. He was told that he was already legally married to his mother, Zandile Mkhize, although his mum is married to his dad, Siphiwo Mkhize. Sandile had to postpone his own wedding because of these shocking news. To make matters worse, his fiancee' died last year. The provincial home affairs manager, Cyril Mncwabe, told DRUM they had the Mkhize family's documents and hoped to find a solution to the issue soon. "This situation is very uncommon. I am following up on the issue and with the help of the department, we will get to the bottom of this and see that the man is assisted." Sandile's parents got married on November 11, 1994. At that time, Sandile was just 14 years old and too young to legally get married. Yet, according to home affairs' records, he married his mother on November 12, 1994. "There are two marriage certificates. It is my parents' marriage certificate and the one where I'm supposedly married to my mother," Sandile told Isolezwe. "This whole thing has really taken its toll on my life," Sandile added, saying his inability to marry the woman he loved was only one of the issues the mix-up has caused.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-mans-life-on-hold-after-discovering-he-is-married-to-his-mom-20191028-2?fbclid=IwAR11TQCaVEnB7fnqp8IPM9Ye090AHgd6EwMav3MqtrV8hVOQEOIb0jJZcF0
