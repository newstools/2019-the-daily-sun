SINDISIWE Ngwane has been living in a mud house ever since she was born. She was over the moon when she heard RDPs would be built in her area. But her joy was short-lived. She found out she was not on the list of people who’d get houses.  The 33-year-old from Ndwedwe, north of Durban, told Daily Sun she learnt on Saturday she wasn’t on the list. “My mother died in 2002 and left me the mud house,” she said. “She had applied for a house before she died. “Councillors know my situation, so I thought I’d be among the first people to get a house. WAR OVER HOUSES “Many councillors have come and gone without helping me.” Sindisiwe lives with her four kids in the collapsing house. “I was shocked to learn I wasn’t on the list when there was a meeting last week,” said Sindisiwe. “We were told at the meeting that someone would soon visit to take our details, but no one came. I heard the project will start next week.” Ndwedwe Development Committee head Bheki Ngcobo told the People’s Paper the committee won’t leave out poor people such as the Ngwanes. He said his committee won’t allow the project to go on if the municipality did not change the list to include the Ngwanes and other poor people. “We plan a shutdown to block the project,” Ngcobo told Daily Sun. Ndwedwe mayor Vincent Chili said the list was compiled by previous councillors before the 2016 local government elections. So it would be difficult for current councillors to explain how some families were left out. Chili, however, said he’d visit the family to see how he could help them.
