BAFANA Bafana coach Molefe Ntseki revealed they opted to call up Ricardo Goss after their attempt to get Mwenya Chibwe failed to bare fruits. After Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Brandon Petersen withdrew from the squad with injury over the weekend, Ntseki was hoping to call-up Chibwe, but the 26-year-old City’s goalkeeper opted for his father's country, Zambia. “We made a small research on Cyril Chibwe of Polokwane City and he’s a South African,” said Ntseki. “He (Chibwe) was born in North West and we send a call up for him to join us for this camp. Unfortunately, he will be playing for his father’s country, Zambia. That is why we have Ricardo Goss coming in.” The Bafana coach added: “Maybe he was approached long before us, maybe they made the necessary preparations for him to join the Zambian team. That is why we have Ricardo (Goss) coming in they are the same age, born in 1993.”Ntseki said they want to inject young blood in the Bafana goalkeeper department that will draw inspiration from veteran Darren Keet and SuperSport United number one Ronwen Williams.Ntseki said: “We are looking forward to bringing in more young goalkeepers because we are looking at the future. Look at Darren Keet and Williams, they have been around for some time, they need someone to look up to them going forward.”Bafana are in camp preparing for the annual Nelson Mandela Challenge against Mali. The showdown is set for Sunday at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth (3pm).
