Queen B and her BFF Lorna
Maseko have kissed and made up. And this week, the duo was all over social
media, tweeting and retweeting each other’s posts. This was the first time
since their fallout. For years, Bonang Matheba and Lorna
Maseka were tight. This until the SunTeam reported Bonang accepting a gift from
a guy Lorna had apparently dating but never told Bonang about it. The glamorous
pair even traveled the world together, and appeared on Being Bonang. But when
Sunday Sun broke the story, the beauties had already turned into sworn enemies. This sent shock waves on social media. The two also unfollowed each other on
Instagram. Now, they seem to have patched things and exchanged messages about
Lorna’s cook book launch. This is the second time Bonang has smoked the
 peace pipe with a friend following her and Somizi’s reconciliation.
