WORKERS at the Verulam Magistrates Court are still reeling in shock after their colleague, a clerk, died on Friday. They apparently found Nkukuleko Mthethwa (30) from Inanda bleeding from the nose and mouth after he fell and rolled down the stairs. A worker said Nkukuleko showed no signs of being ill throughout the day during a Heritage Day ceremony. He had gone to fetch a cellphone charger from the court library when the incient happened “I then heard he fell. Nobody pushed him. He fell on his own. We’re so shocked. We’ve never seen this kind of incident at our workplace.” Another worker said it would take time to forget the incident. “He was enjoying the event. He left us in a shocking manner,” said the worker. “We really don’t know what happened or what caused him to suddenly fall and die.” His family was not available for comment. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a man collapsed at work and was declared dead at the scene. Verulam cops were investigating.
