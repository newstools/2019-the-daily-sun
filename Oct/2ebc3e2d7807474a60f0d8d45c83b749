A LIMPOPO man convicted of the murder of a 70-year-old gogo was sentenced to 23 years jail. TUPAC IS IN JAIL! “You’re selfish! You killed a defenceless elderly woman and didn’t want to be found out by strangling her and taking her phone as she tried calling for help,” said Judge Matsaro Sememnya of the Polokwane High Court yesterday. Peter Selema (40), who was bust in November, was sentenced to 15 years for murder and 10 years for robbery, with two years suspended. NANNY KILLED MY KID! Gogo Veronica Sebopela (70) had hired Selema to plaster her house. Prosecutor Advocate Lethabo Mashiane said the gogo’s death was senseless. Selema’s lawyer, Advocate Desmond Nonyana, wanted the court to give Selema a six-year sentence for robbery, which he wanted to run concurrently with murder. EASTERN CAPE DECLARED A DISASTER PROVINCE! But Mashiane said: “The suspect knew the old lady was living alone at her home when he attacked her. “Even when she took her phone to make a call for help, he strangled her and took the phone. This shows he wanted no one to know about the attack.” After the sentencing, Nonyana submitted an application for leave to appeal, but Judge Semenya dismissed it and the court was adjourned.
