THIS principal takes his job seriously and will do anything to ensure his pupils are the best. Rapoho Primary School principal Marcus Matsebane (46) runs programmes in Mohodi Ha-Manthata, outside Bochum in Limpopo.  He told Daily Sun he introduced computer skills for grade 7 pupils. Matsebane teaches high school pupils maths and allows those at tertiary level to use the internet at his school. He said in years to come, there will be a centre where every pupil in Mohodi Ha-Manthata will be taught maths, science, English, accounting and life sciences.

He’s also introduced the Foundations for Learning programme for the foundation phase, which allows pupils to compete in writing, speech, spelling bees and maths. These pupils are always tops at circuit, district and national level. Matsebane used to be an A student, and that’s why he pushed his pupils to strive for success.
