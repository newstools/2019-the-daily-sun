Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker feels his team could use the big crowd to their advantage when they take on Orlando Pirates in a league clash at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. Despite it being a home game for the team from the Cape Winelands, the Soweto giants are expected, as usual, to have a number of fans in attendance. While they may be outnumbered in the stands, Barker says his players will also get a lift playing in front of a packed stadium. The Stellies coach told reporters: "We have to use the support to our advantage. "I think it has to galvanize you, the more they get behind the team, it must trigger things in your emotions and your mind to say - well they are buzzing they have the crowd behind them, that's got to get you to lift your level and be up for that challenge." The players love playing in front of a crowd, we don't often get a crowd more than a couple of thousands so, if it gets to double figures and above it is a great occasion for players to showcase their ability in front of the supporters. "It won't feel like an away game, it is in Cape Town; Cape Town is our home, not theirs. "The teams met last weekend in a Telkom Knockout clash at the Orlando stadium with Pirates securing their place in the next round with a late goal by Thembinkosi Lorch. Kick-off is at 15:30.
