A SECURITY guard was shot dead and another injured in a cash-in-transit robbery in Motherwell at Boxer shopping centre on Thursday. The security guard from G4S Cash Solution was short in the head while his colleague was injured in the arm when they were attacked by five armed men. A Jikeleza taxi driver who saw the robbery said: "The gang of at least five robbers intercepted the two-security guard as soon as they exited a Capitec bank ATM.” "Thugs fired shorts at the security vehicle that was waiting near the ATM, then the driver drove around them in circles as they were firing. A security guard was shot and died on the spot.” "Despite the efforts of the driver, the robbers fled the scene with the money box and the security guard’s firearm," he said Captain Johan Rheeder said: "The G4S security guards came under attack while they exited a bank at Ngonyama Road, Motherwell around 1pm.” Rheeder said the gang of five robbers opened fire at the two guards as they were walking towards their vehicle.
