MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane may well have landed himself in hot water with the critical remarks he has been making about the PSL referees. The League prosecutor has given Mosimane five days to respond to the letters sent to him, to “either deny or admit the comments attributed to him in the media”. According to the PSL, the prosecutor wrote him a letter in relation to the comments attributed to him about the match officials last week.The forthright Mosimane has accused the officials of poor officiating, which tended to benefit other clubs, Kaizer Chiefs in particular. He cried foul, following their 2-0 league defeat at the hands of fiercest rival Amakhosi at Loftus on Sunday. “Chiefs didn’t have the help from referees who make mistakes last season. It’s a fact. But is this a spiral or what? When is it going to end? This thing must stop. I want to see if referees will make mistakes against Pirates,” charged Mosimane. However, it appears the League have taken a dim view of his comments and will be taking action against him.
