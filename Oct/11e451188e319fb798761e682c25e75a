THE family of Halala Mathula (19) are still waiting for post mortem results. The family from Hlabisa, northern KZN, suspected Halala’s corpse was mutilated at a mortuary last month and cancelled his funeral. They said cops had promised them results within two weeks, but they had not heard from them. Halala’s uncle Bongani Mathula (42) said the cops were not giving them a reason for the delay. When the family went to fetch the body at the mortuary, pieces of flesh were apparently missing from his forehead and back. They said Halala died in hospital after he vomited blood but wasn’t injured. They reported the matter to police and the corpse was taken to a government mortuary. Bongani said: “We struggled to get funds to bury him and had to cancel the funeral because we couldn’t bury him after what we found. “We want cops to give us the results. Then we’ll see what to do.”  KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “The results are ready, but we’re still waiting for the signature of the doctor who conducted the post mortem. “Then they’ll be handed over to the family.” Zwane said he was not sure when the doctor would sign.
