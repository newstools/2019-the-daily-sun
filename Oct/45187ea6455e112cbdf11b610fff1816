VILLAGERS were confused when they saw three men running, holding their heads, last Friday.Then they heard the shocking news – someone had hacked off their ears!This was apparently after a vengeful resident accused them of stealing a JoJo tank. Modisakgotla Moalosi (31) said he had to run for almost a kilometre, his ear in his hand, after the attack in Lokaleng Village in Mahikeng, North West. His friends Omphile Gaobusi (28) and Oduetse Sello (27) also tried to stop their ears from falling off. The men said the drama started when a new resident told them she’d been investigating them and knew they stole her JoJo tank. Modisakgotla said the woman and three men approached them in a truck and bakkie and demanded they return the tank. When they said they didn’t know what she was talking about, they were told to get on the back of the bakkie. “To our surprise, they didn’t go to the police station but to a house belonging to one of them instead,” said Modisakgotla. He said a man driving a government bakkie ordered that they be tied up. “I refused and he took out a rope and tied us against the bakkie,” he said. Modisakgotla said before he knew what was happening, his ear was in his hand. “After cutting it with a knife, the man gave it to me and said it would teach me a lesson,” he said, adding the people told them they were traditional doctors and no one would do anything to them. “After cutting off my ear, they told me to tell my mother to prepare for my funeral,” he said. He was happy he managed to escape with his life. “Those people have money and they said they were well connected.” Omphile and Oduetse had their ears stitched back on while doctors told Modisakgotla it was impossible in his case. “I lost my ear for something I didn’t do. I’m scarred for life,” said Modisakgotla. Colonel Adele Myburgh said a case of assault was opened but no arrests had been made. The SunTeam went to the woman’s house but couldn’t get hold of her.
