TENDAI “Beast” Mtawarira believes the Springboks will have to “play out of our skins” if they are to beat England in the Rugby World Cup final at the weekend. England booked their place in Saturday’s showpiece match in Yokohama with a stunning 19-7 win over New Zealand last weekend that ended the All Blacks’ eight-year reign as world champions. By contrast, South Africa ground out a 19-16 semi-final victory over Wales in an attritional contest 24 hours later to set up a repeat of the 2007 final that the Springboks won 15-6 in Paris, France. “They (England) are playing great rugby and with confidence, so it is going to be a big challenge for us,” said Mtawarira, whose ‘Beast’ nickname, which dates back to his schooldays in Harare, is an affectionate tribute to the 114kilogramme prop’s strength. “They were charged up for the (New Zealand) game, right from the first minute. “They got on the front foot and were more physical and they got their reward.” South Africa have been triumphant in their two previous World Cup finals, memorably beating New Zealand on home soil in 1995 before defeating England in Paris in 2007. – AFP
