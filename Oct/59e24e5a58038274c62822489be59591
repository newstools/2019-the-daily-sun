THE ANC in Gauteng is worried about the party’s league structures as it prepares for next year’s local government election. In the 2016 election, the party was humiliated when it lost Joburg and Tshwane metros and scraped through to keep Ekurhuleni. At the party’s PEC meeting over the weekend, leaders decided to put together a team of youth activists to revive youth structures in the province.

The team was given until December to come up with recommendations to revive the Progressive Youth Alliance. Provincial spokesman Bones Modise said the move was not in response to the EFF, which has been more accessible to young people since the ANC Youth League was hit by crisis after crisis. He said it was simply about strengthening party structures. READ: TUPAC IS IN JAIL! “In a province such as Gauteng, which is relatively youthful, you need vibrant youth structures,” he said. Modise said the Progressive Youth Alliance had been doing well in reclaiming leadership at universities by winning SRC elections at Wits and at tertiary institutions in the Vaal. He said this success would mean nothing if it didn’t translate to the majority of young people in the province, who are still at school. “Our youth structure must be able to lead the championing of issues that affect young people in the province because if you don’t do that, young people might look for an alternative voice,” he said.
