POOR vision can have a negative effect on a child’s performance at school. This is why the Kagisho Shanduka Trust’s school development programme and the Free State Department of Education have been donating spectacles to pupils in need. They visited BEKEZELA Primary School in Sasolburg last Thursday. READ: JUJU REACHES OUT TO MAIMANE! They offered vision screenings, where about 6 000 kids received spectacles and 612 pupils were referred for further examination. The campaign aims to raise awareness about the importance of eye health, to prevent the possibilities of blindness. Dr Thomas Dire from the trust said: “The optometrist-patient ratio in South Africa falls short of the recommended international norms. “The rural populace is the most disadvantaged as most services are concentrated in urban areas and mainly in the private sector.” Dire said this often has a bad effect on children living in the rural areas as impaired vision can often be a barrier to their performance at school. “Last month 407 pupils from 12 primary schools in Villiers, Vredefort, Tweeling and Steynsrus also received spectacles after their eyes were screened and tested. Some eye disorders onset gradually and are undetected with no obvious symptoms until it’s too late,” he said.
