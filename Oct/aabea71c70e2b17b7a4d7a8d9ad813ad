for mer executives on precautionary suspension over allegations of misconduct were offered six-month settlements to part ways with Sars. News24 has seen the settlements offered to former IT head Mmamathe Makhekhe-Mokhuane and group executive of employee relations Luther Lebelo. Through a mutual agreement between the parties, Makhekhe-Mokhuane received R1,8 million and Lebelo got R1, 25 million. Earlier this month, Sars announced it had ended the employment relationship with the two and would not pursue further actions against them, Fin24 reported. In July, it placed Lebelo and two other executives, Hlengani Mathebula and Teboho Mokoena, on precautionary suspension pending the outcome of a disciplinary process. It’s understood Mathebula and Mokoena also received settlement offers. When News24 askedfor comment, the revenue service said: “Sars requests that the privacy of the individuals concerned and the confidentiality of the employer-employee relationship be respected.” In April, Makhekhe-Mokhuane was offered a four-month settlement to step down, which she refused. The offer was made after a clip of her being interviewed by Sakina Kamwendo on SABC Morning Live went viral. Kamwendo had asked her what needed to be done to fix the revenue services’ IT infrastructure, to which she responded: “Ma’am, can you give me protection from yourself?” Sars said she had brought it into disrepute.– NEWS24
