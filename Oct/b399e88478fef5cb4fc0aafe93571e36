GOLDEN Arrows coach Steve Komphela is worried about his charges lack of composure in front of goal. Komphela made this statement on Tuesday after his side lost 2-0 to his former club Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium. Said Komphela: “I am happy with our performances, but we should take our chances as it could have been 2-1 or 2-2. There was a shot from (Danny) Phiri that was missed by (Knox) Mtizwa, but congratulations to Chiefs they took their chances. Football is like that if you don’t take them there is no way you will win matches.” Komphela was also disappointed that Phiri also fluffed from close range. He added: “I think scoring goals is an individual task. You can create goals, but at the end of day it means only one foot can put it in the back of the net, which is what I thought we lacked. There is a ball that Phiri shot and (Daniel) Akpeyi made a save, it bounced off and he was supposed to have tapped the ball in, but he opted for the most difficult. If you put 15 balls and ask him to miss, I am sure he will find it difficult to miss from there, but it happens, it also happened against AmaZulu and Cape Town City. Finishing is not only tactical or technical, it’s also emotional were you have right levels of composure and be calm enough in and around the box. We will go back and work on it.” Komphela says he will also fine tune his defence to avoid making silly mistakes again when they host Polokwane City at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on 25 October. “We went to Bloemfontein (lost 5-0 against Celtic) and conceded five goals, but we had a great game. I had to be objective on how we do our analysis. The second goal against Stellenbosch (drew 2-2) the keeper misjudged the ball, but someone from outside will tell you defensively you need to do work, but it’s individual errors. From a group point of view we are still okay, pairs we are okay, it’s individual errors and we suffer severely when they occur.”
