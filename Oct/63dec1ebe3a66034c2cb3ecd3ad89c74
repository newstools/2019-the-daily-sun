THE number of unidentified bodies in Gauteng mortuaries is shocking. According to DA shadow health MEC Jack Bloom, it was difficult to identify people without documents. He said the information was revealed in a written reply from Health MEC Bandile Masuku to questions he asked in the Gauteng legislature. He said 1 117 of the 17 940 bodies in Gauteng’s 10 mortuaries were left unidentified in the past year. “These are victims of violent deaths: either murder or accidents,” he said. Bloom said they received pauper’s burials in unmarked graves. He said Masuku had promised to set up a website with the mortuary information system by the beginning of next year. “I hope this promise is kept so bodies can be identified on the internet rather than relatives going to each mortuary,” he said. Bloom said about 1 000 bodies remained unidentified every year. He said the highest number of unidentified bodies were at the Joburg mortuary with 360, Germiston with 115, Roodepoort with 107, Diepkloof with 106 and Springs with 105. Bloom said the nine Life Esidimeni patients who were still missing might have remained unidentified and buried in unmarked graves. Gauteng health spokesman Kwara Kekana said the issue was being taken seriously and officials worked with the police to identify and trace families of dead people. “The department is also using radio stations and newspapers.”
