MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has promised to keep voicing his opinion about referees’ performances. Mosimane has previously stated that he believes title rivals Keizer Chiefs are benefiting from referees’ mistakes while they are not getting any joy from officials. READ: PITSO: CHIEFS BENEFIT FROM REFEREES “Chiefs are benefiting from all mistakes of referees and I am not benefiting,” a disgruntled Mosimane said over two weeks ago. And now with their titanic clash just around the corner, Mosimane has once again reiterated his claims. He said he will continue to complain about some of the decisions that go in other teams' favour but never in his side's. Mosimane also called on the officials to be on the ball when the two sides lock horns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Sunday (3.30 pm). "They are under pressure. We are watching them. We are talking. We will complain. We will never keep quiet and say you are feeling jealous because they are winning. No, we say it the way it is," Mosimane told the media. "Benni McCarthy says it. I say it. Okay, other coaches don't want to say it because they are modest, they don't feel like it. We want to win the championship. It's a championship game, we talk. "Jurgen Klopp was complaining when Liverpool played against Manchester City. When Klopp complains its okay. When I complain why do people say I am talking too much?. No, I complain the same way."
