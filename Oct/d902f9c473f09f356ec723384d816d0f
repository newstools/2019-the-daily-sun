SOLDIERS have been visiting schools in Nyanga to teach pupils discipline. Constable Marelda Abrahams said: “We started a drilling project with the defence force at seven schools in Nyanga to instil a strong sense of discipline in boys.” They targeted boys in grades 6 and 7. “Most of the time kids start behaving badly at that age and we can’t just sit and do nothing. That’s why we involved soldiers. “Primary schools which the soldiers are visiting include Liwa, Walter Teka and Imbasa. Sergeant Gabara Samson taught kids from Liwa primary in Nyanga,” she said. “It’s important that we teach these boys how to behave and that crime is dangerous.” Liwa principal Mlungisi Fani said the programme would help pupils. “We have a lot of kids who’re not behaving, but we hope the soldiers will instil some discipline in them,” said Fani. He said soldiers were known for being focused and determined and they hoped this would rub off on pupils. “Boys are out of hand. You talk to them today and they do the exact same things the following day. We appreciate the intervention.” Sanda Kenene (13), a grade 7 pupil at Liwa, said he had been on the programme for six weeks. “We’re enjoying this and are learning a lot about how we should behave,” said Sanda.
