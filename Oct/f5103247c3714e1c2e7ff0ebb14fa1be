BENEDICT Ngomane’s family is traumatised after the 18-year-old was stabbed by a fellow pupil at school. The two grade 11 pupils were allegedly fighting over milk during break at Shobiyane High School in Acornhoek, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday. Benedict’s brother Benjamin (29) said they were worried the school might be protecting the suspect. “No one’s telling us what happened.” He said they wanted to meet school representatives today to get clarity. “We hear the suspect is nowhere to be found.” Benedict’s uncle Nyiko Manzini (30) said they reported the matter to the department. “My nephew almost died but the school didn’t report the matter to the cops.” Benedict said the other boy became angry when he refused to give him the carton of milk from the school feeding scheme. “He jumped over the fence, picked up a bottle and broke it before stabbing me above my eye.” On Friday, Mpumalanga Education MEC Bonakele Majuba visited Benedict at Rob Ferreira Hospital. He said they were against violence at schools and had held a safety indaba to find solutions. Captain Mpho Nonyane advised Benedict to visit Acornhoek cop shop to open a case.
