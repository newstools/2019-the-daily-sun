MANY stokvels save for the festive season, in a few weeks’ time. Money will exchange hands as members will enjoy their earnings with family and loved ones. According to research, R44 billion is saved collectively by 820 000 stokvels in Mzansi each year, and more than 11 million South Africans are currently members of stokvels. The flip side is that thugs are also waiting to pounce on unsuspecting members. They actually come to the meeting where the spoils of the year are shared, get their share and still hook up thugs who must take your share. Maria Magasela (35) from Molapo, in Soweto, won’t forget what happened to her savings buddies last year. “As a group, we chose members to go and withdraw our money. They did it in town but as they came out of the bank, armed robbers cornered them and took all the money, in broad daylight,” she said. This, according to Maria, left everyone heartbroken. “This has made us not to trust each other. We asked ourselves, was a bank teller working with criminals or did one of us shared the information with the thugs?” she said. Maria shared a few stokvel safety tips:  , Make sure you have someone you trust to accompany you when collecting the cash from the bank., If possible, make sure you get someone to deposit your share into your bank account., Avoid showing off once you get your cash., Don’t announce when collecting your money., Alert police as soon as you see that someone is following you, or run to a trusted house and wait there until you know you’re safe. “Criminals mean business and they don’t play once they know you have cash in you, they want festive for their families too,” she said.
