IT IS time for younger leaders to take the ANC forward. This is what ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule told members of the ANC Youth League at the weekend. Speaking at a mini rally held at Suurman Hall in Hammanskraal in Tshwane on Saturday, Magashule said he was not planning to stay in his position after the next elective conference. “Come 2022, I don’t want to see myself here. I need to see a young leader. I don’t have ambition to remain here,” he said. “There are no permanent party leaders. Even myself, as secretary-general, I have no ambition to stay. A young leader must take over.” Magashule said the party needed the youth and called on the league to urgently revive itself. “The mother body needs a militant youth wing to drive radical economic transformation. “We’re happy that in Tshwane they’re working hard. We’re here to support them and to tell them they’re on the right track.” He said the youth league was ready to work. “The ANC is the only hope. The young ones are going to radicalise and ensure the ANC remains relevant,” he said. League member Lesego Makhubela said the youth wing planned on tackling unemployment and a lack of opportunities.
