Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma has publicly spoken for the first time about her years of being a suspect in poisoning her husband,former President Jacob Zuma. Popularly known as MaNtuli, she sat down with journalist Karyn Maughn on Newzroom Afrika. Last month the National Prosecuting Authority(NPA)announced has decided not to prosecute anyone for the alleged poisoning of former president. According to a letter to the Hawks written by acting KwaZulu-Natal director of public prosecution advocate Elaine Zungu, that there was no evidence to pursue the case. Zuma himself had reportedly also not provided a statement detailing the alleged poisoning attempt on his life. MaNtuli spoke about her five years of hell since she was kicked out of the Zuma family home in Nkandla with her three kids."I have been with him since I was 23 years old. It hurt me a lot that anyone would think I could kill him",she shared. MaNtuli said her husband did ask her if she knew about the allegations against her and that an investigation would be conducted. She said the allegations where that she put poison in her husband's tea,sleeping with her bodyguard and was hiding money in an account in Mauritius. Then State and Security Minister David Mahlobo moved her and her kids from Nkandla where they moved around until settling in Greytown. "My kids and I would sleep together on a double bed in this tiny room and house. I tried to go back to Nkandla but I was not allowed to,in 2015." "I felt abused and betrayed all these years."Her husband has yet to make contact with her after her clearance."He hasn't said a word. It's up to him,she said." Top attorney Ulrich Roux has been representing her for free since 2015.He is now helping her to sue the NPA and the Hawks for malicious prosecution.
