THE POLICE yesterday surprised shoppers in the supermarket and butchery at Elardus Park shopping centre, Tshwane. People were shocked to find almost half of the staff were bust for not having correct immigration documents!  The drama happened during an inspection by the employment and labour department with police, Sars, municipal health inspectors, National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications, Home Affairs and agriculture departments. Gauteng Labour spokesman Mishack Magakwe said they got a tip-off that employers weren’t following labour laws. “They failed to issue employees with payslips, pay overtime and there were unlawful deductions. Workers weren’t registered for UIF.” Magakwe said 10 undocumented immigrants were bust, but the department made sure they were paid their salaries before being detained. He said the municipality decided the supermarket couldn’t trade anymore. “The employer failed to provide labour inspectors with risk assessment plans. There was no first aid box, safety files, personal protective equipment and no health and safety representative,” he said.
