EVEN though five years have passed since Senzo Meyiwa was killed, Police Minister Bheki Cele continues to assure Senzo Meyiwa’s family that they’ll reach the conclusion of the case and prosecute the person(s) who gunned down the former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper. Today marks exactly five years since Senzo Meyiwa was murdered at girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s home in Vosloorus. On Friday, the Meyiwa family held a press conference at their home in Umlazi where they vented their frustration and anger at the lack of progress in the case. No one has been arrested yet for the murder of Senzo. Senzo’s father Sam, Sam Meyiwa, who was always seeking justice for his son, sadly passed away in July following stroke and illness. “We are very understanding about the frustration from the family. We would have love to resolved the case the next day after it happened,” said Cele to SunSport. “Yes, we are turning five years since Senzo passed away. With all the hiccups that are there, this matter will be resolved. We’ll push harder as we can."  “We have been approached by Afroforum and other civil rights organisations outside the country. They are willing to assist us,” said Senzo’s brother Sifiso Meyiwa. According to Sifiso, the first prosecutor that was appointed has been chased away for no valid reasons, leaving the family furious. “The police who were involved in the case at the beginning have also been removed,” he said. Added Sifiso: “The one prosecutor that has been appointed, the family has not been informed. There’s no problem within the SAPS, the problem is within the NPA. “We have now called on the president Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in this case to find the root cause why the NPA is not prosecuting on the case.” “From our side we want justice to be served. We know the Afriforum doesn’t play around and they are going to arrest people,” Sifiso added.
