Connie Ferguson has shared some inspirational message amidst all the negativity that has cloud the entertainment industry this week. But, Connie Ferguson posted a video clip of Oprah Winfrey's iconic  speech, in which the media mogul says "it's okay for everyone not to like you". "People don't always like you, they are not always happy for you and if you surround yourself with people, who are not accustomed to tour success, they become fearful, they become scared. Because you are reflecting something back to them that they don't recognise. People, who want the best for you want you to be your best, so my greatest advice to you is to surround yourself with people, who are doing to fill your cup until your cup runneth over," she said. This Instagram post from Connie follows a statement from her company, Ferguson Films, which she co-owns with her husband Shona, released a statement rubbishing the claims, saying Vathiswa was demanding an amount of  money that they simply couldn't afford. ?????????????? . #Repost @allegro_d ··· My cup runneth over ????
