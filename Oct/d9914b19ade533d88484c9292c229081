LAST week, Daily Sun published a story of how Ntombekhaya Thomas lost her grandson to a mysterious fire. This touched sangoma Sibusiso “Mkhulu” Mathe, who donated R10 000 to the family over the weekend. When the sangoma from Makhaza, Cape Town, visited the 52-year-old widow, she couldn’t hold back her tears. “It feels like a dream as I never thought there were people with good hearts like Mkhulu,” she said. Ntombekhaya thanked the People Paperfor publishing her story.  “Daily Sun is doing what should be done by the political parties we vote for,” she said. Ntombekhaya said the fire, which she believed was vutha, hit not long after her husband died and a taxi crashed into their shack. Mkhulu said he donated the money because of what the SunTeam did for him.  “No one deserves the pain the family is going through. They don’t have the money to bury the child who died in that fire and I couldn’t sit back and do nothing.” He told the SunTeam to continue helping people. Mkhulu said he’d also continue to help where he could.
