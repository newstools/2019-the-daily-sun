I don’t want to lose her.” The madala said he found Dipuo (55) lying on the ground on Tuesday afternoon and couldn’t stand on her own as she apparently was drunk. “There was lot of blood. I thought she’d bleed to death. We phoned an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital, where she was stitched on the chin.” Dipuo said she would not stop drinking but would take a break.  “I was from my sister’s and drank too much,” she said. “When I got home I tripped and fell. I almost hurt my eyes.” READ: 'BUSHIRI OWES ME MONEY!" She said her husband has been asking her to stop drinking, but she never listened. “I know he’ll ask me again, but I’d rather take a break than stop drinking my African booze. “But I’ll be more careful. We threw away the wood that almost killed me.” Elliot said she had to obey him as he was the head of the house.
