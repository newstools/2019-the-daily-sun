A teacher
at the centre of a sex scandal at expensive Cape Town private school Bishops is
receiving medical care as the investigation into the allegations that she had a
sexual relationship with a pupil continues. "She
needs counselling, and she's under medical care," said attorney William
Booth, who was appointed by her family to monitor developments in the case. "People
can be severely affected by this, emotionally," Booth said of Fiona
Viotti, a former model turned history teacher and sports coach. It's the
scandal that rocked Bishops Diocesan College in Rondebosch, Cape Town: a
30-year old teacher is accused of having an illicit relationship with an
18-year-old matric pupil. After the
story broke, Bishops Diocesan College in Rondebosch said Viotti had resigned,
but an investigation into allegations of "serious sexual misconduct"
was launched. The school
has asked for privacy as the allegations got tongues wagging with various
accounts of what happened. Booth said
much of what has been reported is speculation, but would not "go into the
merits" and clear up what was wrong or right in the reports. The lawyer
appointed to represent the pupil's interests made it clear that he would not
discuss anything, so his version is limited to an inner circle. "I
can't comment, sorry," he said. In the
meantime, an intimate solo video purporting to be of Viotti, has returned to a
pornographic site after being taken down last week. Booth
expressed concern that people do not understand that they are at risk of being
fined up to R300 000, or imprisoned for up to four years, or both, for
distributing the content without permission. He
explained that people were allowed to send intimate pictures of themselves to a
partner in private, but distributing without permission was a crime. SOURCE: NEWS24
