MZANSI has
one of the highest road carnages in the world. Over 1 612
people died on South African roads between 1 December 2018 and 8 January 2019. Most of the
accidents are caused by reckless driving and fatigue. A video of
a yellow Audi S3 causing an accident on Greenhill
Road in Adelaide, Australia has surfaced on social media. In the
video, a yellow Audi S3 can be seen trying to overtake on a sharp curve â€“ when they
see an oncoming car they then rush back into their lane. As they try
to maneuver back to the correct lane they crash into the back of a white car
and also crash into oncoming traffic.
