HAVE you seen little Lihle Mmusi? The nine-month-old boy was taken away from his mum under false pretence. The incident happened in Protea South, Soweto, just after 4pm on Friday. Police spokesman Sergeant Khalipha Mvula said a middle aged woman, who only introduced herself as Matsidiso, told Lihle’s mum Nancy that she was a relative of the little boy’s dad. But it later turned out she lied. Now a case of kidnapping has been opened. Nancy told the cops that the woman insisted that she was a relative. She told the mum she wanted Lihle and his brother (10) to visit her at her place in Protea South zone 6. Mvula said Nancy lied to the woman that Lihle’s brother hadn’t returned from school. “But she spotted him playing at the neighbour’s house and went to fetch him,” he said. “He took both the kids and left.” Mvula said the 10-year-old boy later returned alone without Lihle. He said: “The boy said the suspect released him to go back home.” The mum of four is devastated and desperately hoping for the safe return of her son. The SunTeam tried to get hold of the woman, but with no success. Police are appealing to anyone with information that could help find Lihle to call Detective Sergeant Masango of the Soweto West family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit on 078 144 7684, or the Protea Glen cops on 011 986 9272.
