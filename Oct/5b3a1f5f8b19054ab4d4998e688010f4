FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns players Khama Billiat and Leonardo Castro played a sterling role when Kaizer Chiefs claimed the Shell Helix Ultra Cup on Saturday afternoon. The pair contributed four goals which were all scored in the first half when Amakhosi routed Masandawana 4-2 at FNB Stadium. Castro scored a hat-trick in which all goals we're assisted by Billiat. The Zimbabwean, who left Sundowns to join Amakhosi last season, hammered the final nail in the Downs coffin at the stroke of halftime, assisted by Castro. Castro started the party when he scored as early as the eighth minute. He netted his second on the half-hour mark. With three minutes added before the break, Chiefs scored two quick goals in a space of two minutes, with Castro completing his hat-trick while Billiat got his name on the scoresheet. Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane started the match with his fringe players, who have not seen much action this season. The likes of Oupa Manyisa, Harold Majadibodu, Sphelele Mkhulise, Aubrey Ngoma and Tokelo Rantie all started, but they could not contain the firing Amakhosi. In the other end, Ernst Middendorp played the Shell match with his strongest line up, which included of Billiat, Castro, Lebogang Manyama and Dumisani Zuma. In the second half the likes of Gaston Sirino, Anele Ngcongca , Ai Meza and Tebogo Langerman but the damage was already done as they only managed to get one goal which was scored by Meza. After Downs goal there was not much to write home about as they kept on pressing Chiefs but Daniel Akpeyi was on his toes until the final whistle. In the last minutes Downs were awarded a penalty which was well converted by Sirino to make it 4-2. Chiefs will now travel to Bloemfontein on Sunday Morning for their Macufe Cup clash against Bloemfontein Celtic which will be played at Free State Stadium, 3.30pm.
