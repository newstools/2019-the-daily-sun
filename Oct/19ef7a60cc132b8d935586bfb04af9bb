This is a
true meaning of every dog has its day. A video of
a housebreaking gone wrong is doing the rounds on social media. In the
video, two dogs can be seen roaming around the yard with
two men who seem to be the thugs on the roof of the house. Following
that, one of the men jumps to the ground and the dogs show him flames.  Then the
door of the house opens a woman who comes out of the house seemingly trying to
stop the dogs from biting the alleged thug. However,
the dogs donâ€™t listen to the woman and continue biting the man, as he tries to escape. The incident
reportedly occurred in Gansbaai Western Cape on Monday.
