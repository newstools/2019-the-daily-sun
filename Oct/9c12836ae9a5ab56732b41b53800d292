We've seen the boom of Apple cider vinegar. People are using for weight loss, skin problems and even as a deodorizer. But does it really help with weight loss? The answer is YES. According to health Expert, Dr. David Minkoff, not only does apple cider vinegar help reduce weight, it also lowers body fat and serum triglyceride levels (triglycerides are the main constituent of the body’s fat cells). He further explains that a study in Japan of 114 obese adults yielded incredible results. They were split into three separate groups — one group added a single tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to their daily intake; one added two tablespoons, and the third group consumed a daily placebo. The treatment took place over a 12-week period. Other than limiting how much alcohol they drank, participants were not asked to change anything else about their diet or exercise routines.The results were striking. On average, members of the group that drank one tablespoon of vinegar every day lost 2.6 pounds, experienced a 0.7 percent decrease in body fat, and dropped triglyceride levels by 26 percent — no small feat.The group that consumed double the vinegar, however, saw even more impressive results — in addition to the same 26 percent drop in triglycerides, those participants lost an average of 3.7 pounds and 0.9 percent of their body fat.As for those who only had a placebo, no weight loss occurred. In fact, those participants gained weight — 0.9 pounds on average.
