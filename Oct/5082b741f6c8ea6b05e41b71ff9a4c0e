Meet the woman who now owns the petrol
station where she started as a cashier. The 36-year-old Khumbu Shelembe from
Mtwalume on the South Coast of KwaZulu-Natal is a remarkable story. Khumbu completed a National Diploma in
Marketing Management from Mangosuthu University in 2004. Three years later she
started working as a cashier at Mobeni service station. At the station she earned her first
promotion after only six months and joined the book-keeping and supply chain
department.In 2011 she completed the Caltex Retailer Courses and the previous
owner of the Mobeni service station unveiled an opportunity for her to buy a
30% share in the business and she grabbed it with both hands.  Later that year, another opportunity
arose for her to own the station outright. This is when she applied for- and
received special funding from Astron Energy, the company that owns the Caltex
license, to gain complete control of the business. The proud filling station owner is
passionate about the fuel industry and has put a lot of hard work into her
journey. “It’s like living a dream” Shelembe says. “When I think of the way I grew up, I never thoughtthat one day I would be blessed like this.” “A fuel station is like any other
business in that it requires hard work and a positive attitude. You have to
consider others and not only think about your own pocket. It’s not about money,
all that counts is the love for the business, being focused, and facing what you
need to accomplish,” she said. Reflecting on her journey, Khumbu tells of her appreciation for those who helped her along the way. “The people I worked with are very good people. They helped me step by step and now I employ other people and I’m happy because I can employ those who are struggling” she says.She has 13 people working at her service station. “I have to be strong and makeAfrica proud of me.”
