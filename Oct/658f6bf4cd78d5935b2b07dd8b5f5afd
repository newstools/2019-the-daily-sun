A fairytale digital love story has become a nightmare for an elderly Cape Town as her Prince Charming has scammed her of almost a million rand!She never met him face to face but they spoke on the phone over the two years of the supposed relationship. TimesLive reports that the 54 year-old woman  was allegedly scammed of R844,000 by the person she met on the worldwide popular site Tinder. Two women and a man have since been arrested in connection with the scam,according said Lt-Col Philani Nkwalase from the Hawks. Gcobisa Sintu was arrested in Port Elizabeth and Tando Magwevana was arrested in East London on October 25 and 26 respectively. A third suspect, Luyanda Bacela, was arrested earlier this month in Cape Town. They have already appeared in court. The woman was milked out of her money between 2017 and 2018 and was made to believe that she had met a successful businessman on the app. "The victim was further tricked into offering her money to help the online lover to overcome business-related challenges, with the hope that the money was going to be paid back,” he said, adding that she was promised that the cash would be paid back with interest. "She believed he was “the love of her life” and had no issues loaning him the money. She sent the money to several bank accounts, as well as through money markets. “Once the money stopped coming, the communication stopped,” he said. When the woman realised what had happened, she opened a case with the police, who began to investigate. “We followed the money,” said Nkwalase. This led to the arrest of the three, who now face charges of fraud. Nkwalase said it was possible that other people benefited from the scheme. “More arrests could be expected,” he said. None of the money has been recovered so far.
