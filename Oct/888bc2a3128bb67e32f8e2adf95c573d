Since the beginning of her rapping career, she has been
under a lot of scrutinies. There was a question on who writes for her and the
allegation that she stole a song from another artist. Boity came out gun
blazing on uTatakho Remix featuring herself, Riky Rick, and Dee Kaola which
impressed a lot of people. Her verse is about how she turned out amazing even though
she grew up without her father. She describes this as a touchy subject. As a
rapper especially a newcomer you constantly have to prove yourself to the
hip-hop lovers and this might be Boityâ€™s big moment. She rapped so effortlessly
and the lyrical content and delivery is on point Rapper Yanga Chief released his EP titled Becoming a Pop
Star (BAPS) today and his fans are still stuck on how Boity killed the song.
The EP is a build-up to his album which will be titled Pop Star.
