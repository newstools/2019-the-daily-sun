 The award winning hip hop star, Solo has released the music video of Two By Two. This song features Buks and shares beautiful visuals of the best days of himself and his lawfully and traditionally wadded wife, Dineo Moeketsi Langa. The couple’s wedding was featured as a three-part documentary on Kwakuhle Kwethu which aired on 1Magic in September. They tied the knot in a traditional ceremony in May and celebrated their union with a white wedding ceremony in October. Some of the couple’s fans have already watched the video and it’s winning all hearts. “I look at these two and I just know what love is. May God bless your marriage and nature it every single day,” Nozipho Lukhele tweeted. “I remember when I was crazy, I thought I hated marriages and won’t get married but after seeing these two, I’m not going to play with anyone’s feeling anymore. I’ll get married and make it this beautiful,” said Dominic Mahlangu.
