SPRINGBOKS attacking kingpin Cheslin Kolbe was one of three players who did not train with the rest of the squad when the players returned from their two day rest on Friday but coach Rassie Erasmus is confident he will be ready for next week’s World Cup quarterfinal. Kolbe wasn’t considered for the final Pool game against Canada here in Kobe on Tuesday because of the ankle injury that forced him off in the final minutes against Italy. It isn’t a serious injury but Erasmus admitted there is a slight element of doubt. “Cheslin still has that ankle injury that ruled him out of selection consideration for the previous game and can’t train at present,” said Erasmus after the Boks returned to training after a two day break on Friday morning. “At the moment he wouldn’t be available to play but hopefully on Monday he will be back in training. I am 80 to 90 percent certain that he will be available for the quarterfinal.” The other man down at the moment is scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies, who picked up a slight hamstring injury playing as a replacement against Canada. “Herschel has a slight hamstring strain so we rested him (from training) as a precaution. Obviously I am slightly nervous as Herschel is one of three scrumhalves here and of course it is a very important position.”
