No child was born to smoke weed, bunk classes, disrespect teachers and parents, or drink alcohol. People often say one should choose one’s company wisely, but most teenagers don’t. One rotten egg affects the rest. Many fragile teens unquestioningly give in to bad influences and indulge in drugs to boost their self- esteem. This can be due to failing their grades and consistently disappointing parents or guardians. The pressure can be so strong that bad influences easily invade their lives. Many get mixed up with friends who smoke or drink. Some luckily keep good company and don’t lose focus. It’s very important that one surrounds oneself with positive people who don’t support or promote bad behaviour, or force people to fight or have sex to fit in. As a result of hanging around a bad crowd, teenage girls fall pregnant and boys join gangs or drop out of school. It’s true what they say: that you’re the product of the people you associate with. You either hang out with people who have positive or negative energy, and this directs your mindset and decides your future. Many later regret where peer pressure has landed them, while others take the same path by not judging the company they keep. Life is simple: you reap what you sow. - Letter from Oratile Nzimande in Tshwane.
