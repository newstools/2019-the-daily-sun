POLOKWANE City forward Walter Musona is pleading with their fans not to panic and promised them that Rise and Shine will come back stronger when the season resumes after the Fifa break. City started the season on a high under new coach Zlatko Krmpotic, but their good run took a nose-dive after they lost two consecutive Absa Premiership games to Highlands Park and league rookies Stellenbosch. This has left their supporters concerned and worried about the future. But Musona, the younger brother of former Kaizer Chiefs lethal striker Knowledge, is confident the Limpopo-based side will return to winning ways when they face Golden Arrows in their next league game at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium (3.30pm) on 26 October. “It is true we did not get the results we desired in the last two league games and we have also dropped on the log,” said the Zimbabwean international. “But that is water under the bridge now. We had a chat about it as players and we want to return to our winning form. “Our fans should not panic. There is no problem in the team. All they have to do is to keep supporting us and we won’t disappoint them, come end of the season.” The 23-year-old is optimistic that they can still challenge for the PSL title under the 61-year-old Serbian-born mentor at the helm. “Zlatko is a good coach and we believe we can achieve a lot with him,”said Musona. “It is still early days and we are positive we can be one of the best teams that can still fight for top spot. All we have to do is to have confidence and play to the coach’s instructions. We have to trust ourselves and work as a team, like before.” Rise and Shine are fourth on the log with 13 points from eight league games. Krmpotic’s team are six points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs, with same number of matches. “I think so far we have done well. It’s not many teams that have 13 points after eight games,” explained Musonda. “All we have to do is to improve and continue working hard to achieve our goal.”
