ORLANDO Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena is pleading with Mzansi’s football fraternity to come up with solutions that will help referees to minimise mistakes. This follows an outcry from coaches about dubious decisions they have made in the PSL this season. Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane also accused match officials for making decisions that “benefit” Absa Premiership leaders Kaizer Chiefs. Steve Komphela, who is currently in charge of Golden Arrows, Owen Da Gama of Highlands Park and Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy were also left frustrated on the dugout by decisions made by match officials that cost them to lose matches. But Mokwena says instead of attacking them, a solution is needed to help them manage the game better. He admitted that Tshegofatso Mabasa’s goal that helped Bucs beat Highlands 1-0 in a league clash on Tuesday was off-side. He went on: “I prefer not to talk about referees, but what’s happening in this country is sad. I commented before I saw the goal (on TV), it was a clear-offside (Mabasa’s goal). "We need to make an honest assessment as coaches and I think referees are crying out for help, maybe they need technology. I don’t know if it’s deliberate, but they need help and we don’t need to bash them.”
