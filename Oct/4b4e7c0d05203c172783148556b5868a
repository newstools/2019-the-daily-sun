MANILA, PHILIPPINES Elaborately dressed cats and dogs and even a palm-sized sugar glider were among the animals blessed outside a Philippine mall on Sunday. This was in celebration of the feast of Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals and World Animal day. Pet owners raised their furry friends as a priest sprinkled holy water on them. “They are like humans to us, so we need to have them blessed and make sure they do not get sick, and continue being with us,” said Filipino dog owner Ram de Castro, while carrying his pet dressed in Miss Universe-inspired red evening gown. More than 100 pets were brought in for this year’s religious and blessing ceremony. Anna Padrilao, a cat owner, said it was only right that her pet gets blessed because he is also a creation of God. “Animals should be treasured the same way as humans”, she said.  World Animal Day, a day of action recognised worldwide for animal rights and welfare, is celebrated on 4 October, which is the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-animal-day-philippines/owners-present-pets-to-philippines-priest-for-blessing-idUSKCN1WL0BL
