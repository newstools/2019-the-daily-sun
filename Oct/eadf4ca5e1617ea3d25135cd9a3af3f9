BANYANA Banyana captain Janine Van Wyk says they are itching to get back into action. They will face Japan in an international friendly on Sunday, 10 November 2019 at the Kitakyushi Stadium in Fukuoka, Japan. Banyana have not played a match since they crashed out of the Olympic Games qualifiers at the hands of neighbours Botswana last month. Although she is excited to face Japan, Van Wyk also admitted that the Asians will pose a huge challenge for Banyana. “I think it’s fantastic that we are getting international friendlies against top quality sides such as Japan,” said Van Wyk. “I think it is going to be a tough encounter, they recently thrashed Canada 5-0 so it is a hinge task that is ahead of us. We haven’t been in camp for a while, that is a challenge in itself. But I think everyone will be excited to come together again and pay some games. “After the loss to Botswana. The players want to prove a point. Hopefully we can come up with a good result against a good opponent to boost our confidence. We know we are still a quality team that can put up a fight against any major team we face."
