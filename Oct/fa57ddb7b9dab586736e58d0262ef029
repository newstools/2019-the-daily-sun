MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane feels Kaizer Chiefs are favourites to win this season’s PSL trophy, saying the Soweto giants have enough time to rest between matches. Amakhosi, who have not won a trophy since the 2014-15 season, are currently top of the standings after eight matches played this campaign. Mosimane feels Chiefs have an advantage over the defending league champions because they don’t have commitments in other competitions, such as the Caf Champions League. Sundowns beat Black Leopards to go up to third in the table, five points behind the Glamour Boys but have played two games less than the current log leaders. Mosimane said: “I call them a well-rested team. They should be able to compete for the league because they are playing on Saturday and then again the next Saturday. They have the energy and time to fix their problems at training. “Sorry, we (Sundowns) have to play every three days, but they (Chiefs) are the favourites for me as we speak and that is what I said about Bidvest Wits last year because they also didn’t have anything to do. “Chiefs are now the favourites.” – SPORT24
