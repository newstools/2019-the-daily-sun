KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp is now singing a different tune about star striker Khama Billiat. The coach and Zimbabwean player were at loggerheads after he featured for his national team during the last international break, a decision Middendorp was unhappy about as he thought Billiat was not fit to play. However, the coach sung a different tune since he praised Billiat for his contribution when Amakhosi beat Golden Arrows 2-0 at FNB Stadium on Tuesday night. Billiat won the penalty that was converted by Daniel Cardoso, and it was his header that hit the upright before Arrows defender Nkosinathi Sibisi directed the ball into his own net in an attempt to clear the ball to safety. “In my opinion, he's (Billiat) close to being 10 out of 10, said Middendorp in a post-match conference.“ Billiat contributed to the team’s performance in terms of his transition from attack to defence. “This is a process and something where he not only earned the man of the match award but, "This is something we really have to mention.  If you really want to challenge (for the league title) and be successful, you need each and every player in your attack and defending.” Chiefs will go into the Fifa calendar break heading the standing with 19 points from eight matches. They will face Mamelodi Sundowns in the Shell Helix Cup on 12 October and then take on Bloemfontein Celtic the following day.
