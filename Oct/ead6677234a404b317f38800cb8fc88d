Although we don’t get paid, we’re committed because we want our community to be safe.” READ: MEET SJAVA'S WIFE! Siyabonga said he was shot while attending an event.

Luvuyo Ngxukuma (42), the second victim, said he was on his way from seeing Siyabonga in hospital when he was shot eight times. Said Luvuyo: “I don’t know how I’m still breathing because they wanted to kill me. The worst part is that I don’t know why.” Siyabonga and Luvuyo said they believed the government needed to do more for neighbourhood watch members.
