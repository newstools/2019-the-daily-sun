UMVOTI mayor Thami Ngubane has accused ANC leaders of trying to get rid of him so that they can loot. The mayor and executive committee members, including the speaker and deputy mayor, were told to resign on Tuesday afternoon. The decision still needs to be endorsed by the PEC. Ngubane held a media briefing in Durban yesterday to respond to regional leaders’ decision to recall him. He felt he needed to set the record straight about claims of corruption made against him and NFP councillor Philani Mavundla two weeks ago. “I’m not aware of any decision to recall me as mayor, but I’m not surprised because there’s a faction in our municipality that doesn’t like me. “What worries me is that the people who’re plotting against me want to serve their own interests and are not concerned about serving the people.” An ANC member told Daily Sun the mayor put the party into disrepute because of his behaviour. The party accused him of costing it a ward after Mavundla won a by-election in August. “The ANC is not happy the mayor has surrounded himself with a lot of bodyguards, which cost taxpayers millions, and about serious allegations of corruption,” said the source. “The final nail in the coffin was a rape that allegedly took place at the mayoral house and which his relative was arrested for.” ANC regional secretary Bheki Lembede said the executive committee was still consulting with the PEC.
