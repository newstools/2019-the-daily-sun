THE family of a 15-year-old rape victim wants justice. The girl from Mtubatuba, northern KZN, was allegedly raped by her uncle a few years ago. The girl’s sister (27) told Daily Sun the family learnt of the incident about a week ago and a rape case was opened on Monday. She said the victim started living with them in May and had lived with her mother’s family before that. They noticed odd behaviour and suspected something was wrong. “She was violent towards other kids,” said the sister. “She’d beat up them up over minor things. “She had anger that she only expressed through violence.” The girl also teased boys in an unacceptable way. When she asked the girl if she wanted to go to the reed dance, she had said yes but refused to go for virginity testing. “She said she can’t be tested because her uncle had raped her.” She reported the matter to the rest of the family, who went to the police. “It’s been a while since the incident, but we’re hoping police will investigate,” she said. She said since opening up about the rape, the girl kept to herself and they believed she needed counselling. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A 29-year-old man was arrested and appeared in the KwaMsane Magistrate’s Court.” The man was remanded in custody and the case was postponed until tomorrow.
