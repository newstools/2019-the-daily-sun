RESIDENTS accused the woman of killing her boyfriend, so they burnt down her shack! Zandisile Pholo (40) died in a shack fire in Browns Farm, Cape Town, on Sunday. Residents believed the fire was started by his girlfriend. On Wednesday they destroyed her shack.  Resident Lizo Magaqa (47) told Daily Sun the woman had been abusing the man but they never thought she would kill him. He said the neighbours were happy the suspect was arrested. “If they let her go, she must not even try to come back. We’ll deal with her,”he said. Nandipha Sawutana (37) said: “She was making trouble for other tenants in her yard and swore at them for no reason.” READ: 'BUSHIRI OWES ME MONEY!" She said the dead man loved the suspect because he never broke up with her. “She beat him up. She even poured acid on a relative’s boyfriend,” she said. One of the woman’s neighbours said they would sleep peacefully now. “We’re praying she does not get bail. There were nights when she would scream at us all night,” said the neighbour. Constable Mihlali Majikela said cases of arson and murder had been registered. “According to the report, a 40-year-old female suspect was arrested for allegedly setting alight the house of the male deceased,” said Majikela. He said the suspect would appear in the Athlone Magistrates Court once charged.
