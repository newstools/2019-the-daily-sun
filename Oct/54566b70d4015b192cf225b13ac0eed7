They were apparently kicked out by their mastandi for not paying R250 rent. The couple rented a shack in Faraday, Joburg. Concerned passers-by saw them in the streets and called Daily Sun. When the SunTeam arrived, the couple were sitting on the pavement with their two-year-old son and one-month-old boy. Tumi said he worked as a gardener in Germiston but lost his job. He had been struggling to raise money for rent. On Sunday, the mastandi told them to leave as they owed two months’ rent. “I tried to beg her to give me sometime to raise money, but she refused. We need money so we can pay rent. We also need clothes for the baby,” he said.
