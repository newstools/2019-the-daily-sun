MORE job losses have been projected for the next few years, according to a report released by the CCMA. On Monday, director Cameron Morajane said more than 200 000 cases were referred to the commission in the last financial year. “These figures are mostly due to unfair dismissals and new labour legislation such as the national minimum wage,” he said. “Nearly 71% of the cases relate to unfair dismissals and the other 11% to unfair labour practices.” Daily Sun spoke to people who registered cases with the CCMA. Kak nurse is jobless! Lerata Motebele (62) from Soshanguve, Tshwane, said he was struggling to get his pension package.

He went to the CCMA last September to seek help. “They ruled in my favour, but the employer did not abide by the ruling and nothing was done about it,” he said. “I no longer have hope that I’ll get my money. “It saddens me to know my children won’t have any financial backing once I’m gone.” Brilliant Sithole (57) said he was unfairly dismissed after raising concerns and complaints. “My case has been dragging on for four years and there’s no official word as to what might have happened next,” he said.
