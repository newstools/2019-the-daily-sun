A South African-based Nigerian and aspiring wheelchair boxer Adesanya
“Tony Torch” Adebayo did not allow disability to determine his destination. The 39 year-old pugilist is a living testimony that wheelchair-bound have
dreams and they can achieve them. Adebayo will be involved on a wheelchair boxing exhibition bout at
Southern Giant All Africa Stars event Turffontein Racecourse on 9 November. Due
to the lack of opponents he will be showcasing his talent against able-bodied
boxer.  According to him, he has been getting a positive feedback from
able-bodied athletes when they saw him sweating and grinding at gym and that
challenges them push beyond their limits because when I train I work twice as
hard as them. Adebayo has been on wheelchair and crutches since he contracted polio at
the age of two, a highly contagious virus that can cause paralysis. Currently, the amateur boxing sensation is the only wheelchair fighter
we have heard of and he intends to make the sport popular in SA first before
talking it to other African countries. Wheelchair boxing is fast growing in Europe, Asia and Kenya and they are
striving to turn it into a legitimate Paralympic sport. “I think in Africa, very few people know about wheelchair boxing. In
Asia and Europe the sport is very big. Disabled athletes do wheelchair boxing. My
aim is to spread it throughout and make it a popular sport. I want show people
that there is life in disability and we can also do a lot of things done by
able-bodied,” said Adebayo.  The dreadlocked fighter has encouraged other people living with disability
to have confidence on their abilities. Adebayo said people living with disability are very strong and there are
good things done by able-bodied that they can do.
