Given everything that went wrong at Eskom's various power
stations, the current load shedding crisis could last at least for a couple of
days, Chris Yelland, energy analyst and managing director at EE Publishers, has
told Fin24.  Eskom itself expects that load shedding could last a week,
according to chief operations officer Jan Oberholzer. He told talk radio
station 702 on Wednesday morning that if the system improves, Eskom will
relieve load shedding where it can.  "[At] this point in time, realistically, we believe the
situation will continue for the next week," he said.  Earlier, Eskom issued a statement indicating it would
implement stage 2 load shedding between 09:00 and 23:00 on Wednesday.  https://www.fin24.com/Economy/South-Africa/load-shedding-could-last-for-days-20191016
