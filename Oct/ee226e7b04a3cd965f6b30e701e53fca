CAMPAIGNING in Mpumalanga, DA leader Mmusi Maimane has refused to comment after reports emerged that former leader Helen Zille had made herself available for a top position in the party. “I’m not commenting on individual candidates for the position of federal council chairperson. The delegates will decide,” Maimane tweeted on Saturday. He dared the party to bring a candidate to challenge him. He also met provincial leaders to ask for their support. The Sunday Times yesterday reported that former party leader, Tony Leon, led a delegation that tried to convince Maimane to quit in a move Maimane supporters believe is an attempt to return the party to the white guard. Other candidates vying for the position are Athol Trollip, Thomas Walters and Mike Waters. Maimane’s troubles started after reports he declared to parliament that he owned a house that belonged to a businessman while he stayed in it rent-free. It later emerged that during electioneering, he drove around in a car owned by Steinhoff CEO Marcus Jooste. This led to calls by the Institute of Race Relations for Maimane to step down and a suggestion that Western Cape Premier Alan Winde should take over. The DA has dismissed the institute’s calls as opportunistic. City Press, meanwhile, reported that Zille entered the contest hours before the close of nominations. Zille reportedly said she no longer believed the contest for the party’s leadership mattered. “The first thing is for the leadership to gel so that the party can start growing again,” she said.
