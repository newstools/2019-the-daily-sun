THE radical transformation business group has called on eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda to stop making threats and to meet them. Federation for Radical Economic Transformation secretary, Robert Ndlela, said this in Durban yesterday. Ndlela said their members had noticed Kaunda was issuing threats against them.  He said the mayor needed to meet the organisation to better understand it wasn’t a group of thugs. “We can’t deny there are some business forums who are still disrupting construction sites, but the mayor must also appreciate those incidents are fewer than before as we’re addressing them,” he said. “As a professional organisation, we are against disruption. The mayor must understand making threats will not solve anything. So, we call on him to meet us so we can fight the disruption together.” Ndlela said Kaunda needed to stop trying to please white business people at the expense of small and black businesses. On Monday, Kaunda and transport and safety MEC Bheki Ntuli warned business forums the government would deal with them harshly if they disrupted the start of matric exams this week. This came after some members of the controversial Delangokubona Business Forum allegedly threatened to burn trucks delivering exam papers because they were not included in a tender. Kaunda and Ntuli said the government would not be dictated to by thugs and dared them to torch trucks if they wanted to see the power of the government. The mayor’s spokesman, Mluleki Mntungwa, said Kaunda’s door was always open to anyone who wanted to meet him.
