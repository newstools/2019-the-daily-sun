FORMER Bidvest Wits players Edwin Gyimah and Thobani Mncwango have joined Black Leopards. The duo joined Lidoda Duvha after impressing coach Luc Eymael during their trial with the club. Both of these players were released by The Student in July this year after failing to make an impression under coach Gavin Hunt. They joined Leopards in a short term deal which will see them playing for the club until the end of the season with an option to renew. Leopards confirmed their signing on their official twitter page.
