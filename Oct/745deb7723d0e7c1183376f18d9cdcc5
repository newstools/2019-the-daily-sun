AN ANC councillor has apologised to author Jackie Phamotse. Chesterville ward 24 councillor and ANC member Sfiso Mngadi made the apology in response to claims by Jackie that she was raped and beaten by a top party member.  Jackie and Omotoso trial witness Cheryl Zondi were guest speakers at a seminar at Durban’s uShaka Marine World last Monday. Mngadi said: “On behalf of the ANC, I’d like to apologise. I’m willing to follow it up and bring the perpetrator to book.” Speaking about her experiences, also described in her book BARE, Jackie said: “He repeatedly forced anal sex on me. Him and his friends would force sex on me as part of their sex cult. “I fell pregnant. Him and his wife organised an illegal abortion. He had the power to sign off tender contracts. He also was illegally selling human organs.” Jackie said: “I’ll not reveal his name as I have no intention of taking legal action.” She was happy someone from the ANC had taken accountability and apologised. The SunTeam tried to get comment from ANC spokesman Pule Mabe since last week with no success.
