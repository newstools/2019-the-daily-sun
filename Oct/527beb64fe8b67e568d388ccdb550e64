KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp will head to Cape Town on Saturday with a lot of options having analysed majority of his players in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup and the traditional Macufe Cup. Amakhosi on Sunday lost 2-0 to Bloemfontein Celtic in the Macufe Cup with goals coming from Thato Lingwati and Tumisho Mogakwe, which is contrary to Saturday's emphatic 4-2 win against Mamelodi Sundowns in the Shell Cup at FNB Stadiu. The German coach said he was happy to have had an opportunity to see how far some of his fringe players are developing, especially those who have not been in the field for a long time. He said: “We had a fantastic weekend with majority of players having had good opportunities.” True to that, but their Telkom Knockout date against Benni McCarthy's Citizens will not be a walk in the park, especially after the Capetonians lost in their last Absa Premiership match 2-1 to AmaZulu. With Chiefs having dominated the Macufe Cup, winning it seven times, it was expected that they will continue with their run of form, but a 2-0 win by Celtic kept the trophy in the Free State. Even the match against Cape Town City will just be a dress-rehearsal to their big PSL clash against Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium, a match that is expected to spark fireworks. This is one match that Downs coach Pitso Mosimane said “it is pay back time” and it promises to give evidence that Saturday’s Shell Cup result was no fluke. Celtic coach, Lehlohonolo Seema, said: “We don’t have the luxury of having such games, hence we appreciate the Macufe Cup. We take this tournament seriously. I must appreciate my technical bench members, Simon Kgopane and John Maduka. This is a big boost for us heading to the Telkom Knockout.” PAST MACUFE CUP RESULTS 2018: Celtic 0-2 Chiefs 2017: Celtic 2-4 Chiefs 2016: Celtic 1-4 Chiefs 2015: Celtic 1-0 Chiefs 2014: Celtic 1-1 Chiefs (Celtic won 5-3 via penalties)
