YOU’D have expected Ernst Middendorp to shout victory from the rooftops after he edged his rival Pitso Mosimane. But, far from it.The Kaizer Chiefs coach is not rubbing in the Sunday’s 2-0 league win over bitter rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. Instead Middendorp insists one swallow doesn’t make a summer. “This is not a runaway win. We won a game, that’s all. I’m not spending too much time thinking about whatever is going on in the league,” said Middendorp. “If you start having wetness in your eyes and start celebrating, you’ll have a big problem towards the end. It’s still early. The league can look totally different after three games. “I will not be worried about Sundowns‚ Bidvest Wits‚ SuperSport United or whoever is in the race. I also believe a team like Cape Town City, if they win three or four games in the row, they are in. “There is nothing sweet about this win. At the moment the important thing is three points and nothing about sweetness. Happiness is the biggest enemy of your development and progress.” It gets tougher for Middendorp as he faces daunting trips to Port Elizabeth and Durban next week. First, Amakhosi tackle old-foes Orlando Pirates in a Telkom Knockout quarterfinal at to Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday, before they fly out to Port Elizabeth for a league fixture with Chippa United on Wednesday. They will complete the week with another derby clash, this time in the league, on 9 November at the FNB Stadium.
