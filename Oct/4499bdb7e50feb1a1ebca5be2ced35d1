TV host and business man, Masego "Maps" Maponyane got the shock of his life when he came across photos of his lookalike on social media. The photos were posted by Prince Thaido on his Twitter page while he was just lazying around with his cup of tea. His look-alike was wearing a cap and spectacles, but it the facial features that really jump at you, you might have to blink a couple of times to realize it's not Maps. The presenter who is well-known for his fashion sense and modeling was left in awe moments. The 29-year-old said he needed to look twice at the pictures. He responded on the tweeted pictures and wrote: â€œNeeded to look twice at this when I came across it while scrolling through my timeline," he shared. Maps recently opened a restaurant called Buns Out last month.
