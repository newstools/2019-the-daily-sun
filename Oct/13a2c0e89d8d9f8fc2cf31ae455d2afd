RESIDENTS walking through the cemetery were shocked when they stumbled into an infant’s body among the gravestones. The body, believed to be of a five-month-old baby, was found at the Lindelani Cemetery, near Ntuzuma, in KZN, on Tuesday. It was dressed in a blue jumpsuit and wrapped in a blanket. It had injuries to its face. Blood was also coming out of its mouth. Resident Nokuthula Dladla (38) said: “It looks as if the baby was dumped during the night. It was so sad seeing the baby lying there.” Another resident urged cops to treat the matter with the seriousness it deserved. “The culprit should immediately be arrested. It would be difficult if the person isn’t from around here,” said the resident. Police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the discovery.
