POLICE in Tshwane were rewarded on Wednesday night for their hard work and passion. Hardworking cops went home with lots of awards at the first ever Tshwane District Excellency Awards.  District commissioner Major-General Daniel Mthombeni said the awards aimed to acknowledge the bravery, loyalty and determination of the men and women in blue. “You’re the cream of the crop in the whole district. We appreciate the long hours you put in by going beyond the call of duty,” he said. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said he appreciated the nominees and winners. He also thanked Mthombeni for being a good leader. “Being a good leader is determined by the team you’re leading,” he said. Mawela said if cops loved their country and its people, they had to change it for the better. “You must put yourselves in the shoes of the victim. By doing so, you will never take the people of this country for granted.” Mawela told the cops they were ambassadors of the country. “Let’s work together to eradicate corruption in Gauteng. I have made the drugs problem a priority as people are always complaining about this.”
