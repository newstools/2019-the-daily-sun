The ANC in Tshwane says it wants the City to rename a road and taxi rank in honour of slain taxi driver Jabu Baloyi. Baloyi was shot and killed in August, allegedly by a foreign national, in Pretoria.  The Sowetan reported at the time that people believed to be police officers were found by taxi operators to allegedly be involved in the selling of the drugs. TSHWANE TAXI DRIVERS ASSAULT DRUG DEALERS! It was reported that Baloyi confronted some of the drug dealers, resulting in a scuffle. Shots were reportedly fired, resulting in the Baloyi's death. Angry taxi operators then used the city's buses to block traffic in order to "deal" with drug dealers. Foreign-run shops were also looted and burned by a mob that claimed it was on a mission to rid the city of drug dealers. In a statement, the ANC's Greater Tshwane Region said, in memory of Baloyi, it had taken a decision to honour him as a hero by proposing the renaming of Dr Savage Road and Savage Taxi Rank to Jabu Baloyi Avenue and Jabu Baloyi Taxi Rank. JABU'S FAMILY 'WILL SEE JUSTICE' "The ANC has communicated its intention to the family of Baloyi and we will appreciate the support of Tshwane residents and interest groups in this regard," it said. In September, Tshwane Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa promised to donate R100 000 to Baloyi's family. Mokgalapa made the announcement after his visit to the family home. He said the donation was an immediate intervention and a response to Baloyi's family's plea for financial assistance following the sudden death of their loved one.
