FIVE suspects appeared in the Butterworth Magistrates Court on Monday in connection with stealing money from Sassa. The suspects apparently went to the offices in Butterworth and asked for a certain official, who was not there. The official on duty claimed they told her to give them Sassa cards in exchange for money. She asked them to return in an hour and told her manager, who then called the police. The Hawks and police bust the five, who were from Gauteng and KZN, on Friday. This happened while they were giving the official a list of beneficiaries to place on the Sassa system. Regional Sassa manager Bandile Maqetuka said: “It’s evident this syndicate is operating in Gauteng and KZN as they were making fraudulent grant withdrawals there. “In Butterworth, the five had a list of accounts that were to be changed from the rightful beneficiaries. After capturing and activation, they would have been able to withdraw R1,3 million. “Of the two arrested, three are from KZN and the other two from Gauteng. “Accused number one has a similar case pending in East London, while accused number two is out on bail and set to appear in court in Joburg on Friday. “Sassa was able to trace user names used by this syndicate, and a total of six Sassa officials at various Eastern Cape offices were identified as their contacts.” During their court appearance, the prosecutor didn’t oppose bail for the five suspects. They were granted bail of R8 000 each and were due to appear in court again on 20 November.
