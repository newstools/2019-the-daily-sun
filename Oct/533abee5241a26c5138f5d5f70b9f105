WHEN the six-year-old was asked to read in class, he struggled with some words. Instead of helping him, his teacher allegedly hit the back of his head, smashing the boy’s head into his desk and knocking out his front teeth. The boy’s family from Thaba Nchu, Free State, told Daily Sun the incident happened on Friday at a local primary school. Over the weekend, the boy’s 26-year-old sister posted photos of his injuries on Facebook, angering many. She told the SunTeam her family had no choice but to open a case with the police. “My little brother said when he started bleeding, the teacher just said ‘askies’ to him. You can’t use corporal punishment, especially on kids of this age,” she said. “We’ve opened a case against the teacher and we want to see justice. We plan to take my little brother to the dentist to ensure there’s no more damage to his teeth.” She said her brother was brave after the attack and put his teeth in his shoes, hoping the tooth fairy would leave a present. “He doesn’t seem to be scared to go back to school, but that doesn’t mean what happened was right,” she said. Free State education spokesman Howard Ndaba said the allegations were being investigated. “Pending the outcome of the investigations, appropriate action will be taken,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said a case of common assault was opened but no arrest had been made.
