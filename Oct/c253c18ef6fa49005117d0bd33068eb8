NAMIBIAN Helalia Johannes wrapped up the Spar Women’s 10km Challenge in style on Sunday by completing a six-by-six victory in 2019. No one has ever breasted the tape first before the marathoner in the six race events, with the last being the Joburg edition of the race.Other Spar races she won includes the Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Pretoria and Maritzburg. And she received a big surprise when she finished the race at Mark Park, Emarentia at 33:16, where she was welcomed by Namibian ambassador to South Africa Veiccoh K. Nghiwete. With all set and done, Helalia took home the honours of being the 2019 Spar Grand Prix champion by accumulating more points that any of her competitors. Second was Ethiopian Tadu Nare while Kesa Molotsane looks to be occupying third place. Helalia came from this race straight from running the Doha Marathon in the Middle East. She admitted that the race was hard: “I gave it my all. All these wins are for my country, I’m glad that I’ve put my country on the map. All this by the grace of God.” Second to her at Mark’s park was Comrades and two Oceans marathon queen Gerda Steyn who is preparing herself for the New York Marathon next month. Steyn crossed the line in 34:28 ahead of Irvette van Zyk who was 12 seconds behind. The Joburg edition of the race is seen as one of the most difficult, but Johannes said she’s enjoyed it and the weather. All her efforts did not ho unnoticed from her competitors who heaped praise on her talents. “We such athletes who would push us to record faster times. It was great running with her,” said Steyn. Nghiwete said they are planning a great welcome home function for Halelia to celebrate her one of the ambassadors of their country. “She has already been a Diplomatic Passport of Namibia. She can fly out anywhere at anytime. This is something that you don’t just easy,” Nghiwete said.
