D ESIGNER Sandi Mazibuko’s sleek fashion is amazing on and off the red carpet. The founder of House of Fabrosanz has placed special emphasis on creating eye-catching garments that add charisma to the wearer on any ocassion. Sandi launched her business in 2011 when she saw the demand for her clothes. Said Sandi: “Young entrepreneurs should start their businesses now. “It’s time to tell our story in good quality because people want to spend money on garments that are of good quality.” Sandi said she recently officially launched the second iteration of her nguni print. The first design was launched at the Paris Fashion Week in September last year and quickly found favour with the international and local markets. According to Sandi, the inspiration for the nguni print came partly from hand-made Zulu beadwork. Explained Sandi: “The first print was copied a lot and ended up flooding everywhere. “So with the second print, I decided to put the brand’s name on it and it’s the black and white version. “This is the new pattern, the same story and the colours are those of the country’s national flag.” As a Zulu woman, Sandi wanted something that represented her. “But it was sad to see many counterfeits of the brand. “The counterfeit affected us as a business because people didn’t see anything special about owning the brand. “So, we decided to educate more people about our brand on social media.” She’s since learnt to always protect her creation by copyrighting it.
