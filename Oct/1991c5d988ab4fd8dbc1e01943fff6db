THULANI Tshabalala said his life was complicated. He shares an ID number with a stranger. He now wants Home Affairs to sort out his problem. Thulani (42) from Diepkloof, Soweto, said he’s been struggling to fix his ID problem for two years. He said Home Affairs told him he shared the same details with someone else. “I was told to reapply for a new ID and change my surname,” he said. “I changed my father’s surname, Tshabalala, and reapplied using my mum’s surname, Thwala. But it seems he made things worse. Home Affairs told him to wait until the duplicate case was resolved. “I want Home Affairs to solve my problem because they’re the ones who gave us the same ID number.”. I didn’t do anything wrong but I’m the one suffering.” Thulani can’t get assistance when he tries to open accounts, but there are credit records in his name. He receives bank statements and water bills. “This has been going on for too long. I want it to end so I can get my ID.” I am even blocked from using my old ID. I need help,” he said. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola told Daily Sun he was aware of Thulani’s case. He said the matter was referred to the relevant peoplewho deal with such issues and they would contact Thulani.
