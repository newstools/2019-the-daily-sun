THE mum of an 11-year-old girl who was gang-raped believes the law should be changed. “The three boys who raped her, she said are between 14 and 20 years old,” the mum said. “Her life will never be the same after what they did to my girl, but they’ll not stay in jail. “The law should be changed so that they can be sent to jail for a long time.” The 35-year-old mum from Marikana in Cape Town said her daughter couldn’t go to school after the incident which happened last Tuesday. “My child hasn’t been back to school. She can’t walk or sit properly,” she said. “I need someone who’ll help me so I can help her.” Noluthando Malibeni (43) of the Likuwe Ithembalethu Youth Foundation said the victim’s friend came running to them, saying her friend had been abducted by a group of boys. “We went to the police station so cops could go with us to the shack,” she said. According to Noluthando, when they arrived with the cops, one of the suspects was raping the victim. “The other two were waiting for their turns,” she said. “This is a strong case. “We hope they’ll be kept in jail because they were caught red-handed raping the poor child,” Noluthando. She said they meet every day with young girls from 5pm to 6.30pm. “We don’t keep them after dark because we don’t want them to be victims of the same crime.” Foundation founder Anathi Kana said it was their objective to keep the kids off the streets. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said three suspects, aged between 14,17 and 20, were arrested in Marikana squatter camp.
