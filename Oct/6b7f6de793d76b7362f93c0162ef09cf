MAMELODI Sundowns have a tough week ahead of them. Just two days after hammering AmaZulu 5-0 in the Telkom Knockout last-16, the Tshwane giants have to lace up and go again.

That is three matches in the space of one week. That, though, is something Downs have grown used in recent years due to their participation in numerous competitions.
