 NETBALL SA team captain Bongiwe Msomi has described 2019 as a “great year” for the sport. Msomi was named as KZN Sportswoman of the Year on Saturday This comes after the Spar Ladies team reached the semi-final of the 2019 Vitality World Cup in July that was held in England but narrowly lost 55-53 to the Australian Diamonds in the semis. Overall, the team coached by Australian-born coach Norma Plummer finished fourth. On the back of that achievement, the Proteas have been nominated in two categories in the SA Sport Awards. “I think it has been great year if you look at the World Cup performances,”said Msomi. “The girls have been amazing. We have played with top four countries a couple of times and it didn’t go well at times. At some point the results were close matches against really professional teams. “Then came the World Cup. So it was great year indeed.”
