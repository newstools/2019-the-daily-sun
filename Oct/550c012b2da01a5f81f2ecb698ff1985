AS HE was screaming for his roommate to open the door for him, Mucebisi Nene was gunned down. The 34-year-old from Nkandla was found dead on Sunday in front of the door to his room at KwaMashu Hostel, north of Durban. His brother Khulekane (35) said he received a call from Mucebisi’s roommate about the deadly shooting. “My brother was shot several times. There was blood splashed on the door,” he said. Khulekane said his brother’s cellphone and wallet were not taken, which left him confused as to why he was killed. “His roommate told me he left earlier to go and drink with friends. “When Mucebisi came back he called out his roommate’s name to open the door because he was being followed. “Maybe someone followed him home from where he had been drinking.” Khulekane and his brother started living at the hostel in 2017 to be closer to work. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was opened.
