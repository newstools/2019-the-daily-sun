KAIZER Chiefs have sent a statement to their rivals in the Absa Premiership. They comfortably dispatched defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns 2-0 at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Sunday. Samir Nurkovic was the star of the show – bagging both goals to hand Chiefs a crucial away victory. The top of the table clash lived up to all the expectations with both teams going at each other. Tensions were high on and off the pitch from the first whistle. On the pitch, tackles were flying, while of it, words were being exchanged between both coaches. Pitso Mosimane and Ernst Middendorp continued their war of words with the two mentors at each other’s throats at half-time. Meanwhile, Chiefs were having more joy on the pitch with Samir Nurkovic putting them in front in the sixth minute. Downs were forced to chase the game – Gaston Sirino and Jose Ali Meza their best players going forward. But Chiefs were solid at the back with Eric Mathoho, Yagan Sasman and Daniel Cardoso thwarting Downs’ attacks. Nurkovic then sealed all three points for Chiefs in the 78th minute. Chiefs solidified their place at the top of the log as they are now five points clear of Downs.
