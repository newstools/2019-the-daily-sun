CONCERNED parents believe the only way to stop violence in schools is to involve the Department of Education. Parents of pupils at Tholamandla Primary School in KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, fear the situation at the school could turn into a bloodbath if nothing was done to stop the lawlessness.  They told Daily Sun the school was teeming with bullies and unruly pupils. Last Thursday a pupil was stabbed with a bottle over sweets. The parents said their kids were now afraid to go to school. “We want the department to intervene by bringing in cops to search and speak to pupils causing chaos,” said a parent. “This matter should be dealt with before things get out of hand.” Another parent said the school management had called meetings at which it urged parents to talk to their kids about the situation – but in vain. “These children will end up becoming thugs if this is not dealt with as a matter of urgency,” said the parent. KZN Department of Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said parents must co-operate to address the matter. “The school can apply for police to come to the school and search pupils,” said Mahlambi.
