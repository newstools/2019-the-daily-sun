TANZANIAN authorities have allegedly forced more than 200 unregistered asylum seekers to return to Burundi despite the political crisis in that country. Human rights groups reported that Tanzania had done this by threatening to withhold the refugees’ legal status. The forced returns follow a 24 August agreement between Tanzania and Burundi that seeks to repatriate about 180 000 Burundian refugees by 31 December. Bill Frelick, refugee rights director at Human Rights Watch, said Tanzanian authorities had intensified pressure on unregistered Burundian refugees to the point of coercion, violating their rights under international law. – CAJ NEWS
