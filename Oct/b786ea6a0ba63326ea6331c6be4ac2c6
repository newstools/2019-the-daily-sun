NATIONAL lottery operator Ithuba launched a new competition, Raffle 5, on Wednesday. Ithuba invited previous winners, reporters and a few celebrities to the launch, held at its offices in Sandton, Joburg. The SunTeam got a chance to experience what the winner would win by driving the luxurious Mercedes-Benz convertible up for grabs to a party at Nirox Sculpture Park. This year’s raffle would see 10 people walk away with the brand new C200 Mercedes-Benz. Last year, houses worth R2 million went to six people. One of last year’s winners, who didn’t want to be named, said he was going to try his luck again. “I was given R2 million to buy a house. I bought a simple but nice house in Spruitview. “I also bought a car and invested some money,” he said. Gift Ngamume (21) from Tshwane, who won a Mini Cooper last year, said he’d also play again. Ithuba corporate relations executive, Khensani Mabuza, said cash prizes were also up for grabs. She said 500 000 tickets would be available for R50 each. “The tickets will be available from Sunday and the draw will be in January.”
