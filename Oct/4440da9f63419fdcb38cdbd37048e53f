She said the expo brings tasteful stimulation to premium venues.     “Sex is fun, and The Love Expo is the most fun you’ll have all year. It’s tasteful, it’s entertaining and it’s the sexiest shopping experience,” she said. One of the special guests showcasing his skills was the world-famous penile artist, Australia’s Pricasso.
