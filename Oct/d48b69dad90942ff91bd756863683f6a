Critically acclaimed South African duo, Mafikizolo are getting us ready for the festive season with their new single, NGEKE BALUNGE. They describe it as a heartfelt love song written and produced by the renowned Mondli Ngcobo who accurately captured the spirit of the group. It tells a tale of an African Romeo and Juliet, who no matter what happens around them - they will always find their way back to each other.“Ngeke balunge, Ngeke bas’qede” Based on a love story set to tug at the heartstrings of many, Theo and Nhlanhla remind us of the original sound that thrust Mafikizolo into stardomand opened them up to universal opportunities. Their strong African heritage has made them one of the continent’s most valued musical exports that has given us timeless music for over 20 years.
