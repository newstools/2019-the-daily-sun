MAMELODI Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene is itching to remind Mzansi of his qualities. The Zambian stopper, who has played second fiddle to Ugandan Dennis Onyango at Downs since joining in 2013, will get his opportunity to shine against Kaizer Chiefs. The two title rivals lock horns at Loftus Versfeld on Sunday (3.30 pm). Mweene will be in goal for Downs after regular keeper Onyango went back home to prepare for his father’s funeral. “It’s unfortunate that Denis lost his father,” Mweene told his club’s website. “But at the end of the day, the team has to continue to play. I think I have to put some minutes in my legs, but it is not about me but about Sundowns. ”Mweene, who also played and kept a clean sheet against Highlands Park in the Absa Premiership on Wednesday, will be looking to do the same against Amakhosi. “I didn’t do too much against Highlands, but when I was called on I did very little,” added Mweene. “As a goalkeeper, you always have to be ready because you never know when your time could come. A goalkeeper doesn’t really need match fitness,” the veteran goal minder said.”
