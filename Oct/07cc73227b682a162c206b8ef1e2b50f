 CAPE Town City boss, John Comitis, is on a mission to detect the type of virus that has attacked his club. The once mighty Citizens have gone an overall of nine matches without a win - seven in the Absa Premiership, and were knocked out of the MTN and Telkom Knockout. Their latest shocker was a 1-0 loss to Maritzburg United this weekend, which raised alarm bells and their fans started making noise on social media. Speaking to SunSport on Monday, the City boss has calmed the situation down by informing their fans that he is on top of it. Asked if coach Benni McCarthy could be the problem by failing to lead his charges to victory, and is his job safe, Comitis was non-committal but opted to say: "We want to do what is right for the club." "We are assessing the players' attitude and other risk factors that could be affecting the club," said Comitis. "It is very key to assess the risk profile of the club and those unwarranted risks in the club. You have be realistic that when you're two goals behind, there is a chance that you might lose the match. "But with our club, we are playing very good football, but we just can't win matches. And add to that, we have been unfortunate with injuries to key players. That is also in the equation. But guaranteed we will do what is right for the club." He said at times club chairmen would be tempted to fire all 26 players and their coach, but that would not solve the existing problem. "It is best to start by first finding out where is the actual problem. Why are we not producing. This week I have a little bit of breathing space and will spend time assessing all the challenges in the club, with the hope of finding the root of the problem." Cape Town City on Monday confirmed the signing of Greek defender Giannis Potouridis.
