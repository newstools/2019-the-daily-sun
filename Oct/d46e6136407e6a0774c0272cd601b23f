The Springboks have moved up to second place in the latest World Rugby rankings. This follows the completion of the past weekend's Rugby World Cup semi-finals. England's 19-7 win over New Zealand saw them surge to the top, while South Africa's 19-16 win over Wales saw them move up a spot into second, with the All Blacks dropping from first to third and Wales moving down a spot to fourth. Saturday's final between South Africa and England will determine which of the two nations finish the year as the world's top-ranked team. New Zealand will face Wales in Friday's third place playoff and this match will also have an impact on the rankings. The World Cup final is scheduled for Yokohama Stadium at 11:00 (SA time) on Saturday, while the Friday's bronze final will be played at Tokyo Stadium, also at 11:00 (SA time).
