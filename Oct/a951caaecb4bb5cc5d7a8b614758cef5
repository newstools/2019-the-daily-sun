COPS had a tough time getting a rape accused out of the Nebo Magistrates Court, near Groblersdal, Limpopo, yesterday. Angry residents were baying for his blood. Cops had to transport him to Hlogotlou Police Station in a police Nyala escorted by three bakkies. READ: FROM CASHIER TO OWNER! The 35-year-old faces charges of rape and murder after Boitumelo Matsekelong (7) died at Polokwane Provincial Hospital on Wednesday. The girl was found with a crushed skull in the bush earlier this month after she was raped. Her aunt, Kgolane Maleka (54), and mum Refilwe Matsekelong (32) were traumatised in court. Boitumelo’s uncle, Ntapane (50), said doctors told the family she died from internal bleeding. “After raping her, he crushed her head. It’s hard to believe as the suspect is a neighbour.”  Her bail application was postponed to 8 December. She was bust last Tuesday after allegedly confessing she put crushed glass in his porridge and buried him at an unfinished house in Hlalanikahle Village. Education MEC Polly Boshielo said the department was devastated.
