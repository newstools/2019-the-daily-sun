WHAT do GladAfrica Championship newbies JDR Stars and Nedbank Cup Champions TS Galaxy have in common? They both have the ability to punch well above their weight and the drive to silence doubters. Galaxy managed to do that last season, pulling off one of the greatest shocks in history by becoming the first team from Mzansi’s second division to win the Ke Yona Cup. No one had expected Galaxy, barely a year old at the time, to upset Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in the final. And JDR Stars find themselves in a similar situation, doing surprisingly well in the league, but very few believe they could go all the way. The small, unfashionable team based in Tshwane, is determined to take a leaf out of the Rockets’ book and have a fairy tale run of their own in the Championship. If that was not motivation enough, there is also the astonishing story of Leicester City who, in 2016, shocked the world to win their first top-flight league title in their 132-year history. The Hammer Boys’ owner and coach, Nditsheni Nemasisi, has told his players to believe they can achieve the improbable this season. Ironically, they face the same Rockets this afternoon at Kameelrivier Stadium (3.30pm) as they look to stay among the pacesetters in the Championship. “No one believes we can go all the way. People keep saying it’s early days. But we’ve played seven games and are still among the best teams this season. We’ve shown our quality against some strong teams.” But it doesn’t’ matter if they take seriously or not, in the end, they will be forced to sit up and take notice.
