 A Durban
woman arrested in connection with the death of orthopaedic surgeon Dr Melvin
Naidu acted in self-defence, her lawyer said on Monday. The woman,
31, who cannot be named because she has not appeared in court yet, did not face
any charges or stand before a magistrate after the State chose to investigate
the case further. Her lawyer,
Ravindra Maniklall, said she had claimed self-defence. "She
claims she was attacked, and she acted in self-defence. We made confidential
representations in terms of the actual incident that occurred between the
parties." He added:
"The State is not enrolling the case. They don't believe they have a
sufficient case to prosecute at this point in time." Maniklall
said the decision not to prosecute her could, however, be overturned. "The
State will investigate the case more fully and wait for the reports to come in
and make a final decision. It must be emphasised that this is an interim
decision." The
National Prosecuting Authority has not yet responded to a request for comment. The woman
is thought to have been the only other person in the plush Pearls Hotel room
with Naidu on October 17. Police
spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala previously told News24 that other guests
heard shouting before calling hotel security. She said
the woman had called for help, as did Naidu who lay on the floor outside his
hotel room. He had sustained a stab wound to the neck and was certified dead on
the scene. The woman
was then arrested. SOURCE:
