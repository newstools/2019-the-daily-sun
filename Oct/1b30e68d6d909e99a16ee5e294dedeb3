TWO cars were burnt to ashes by protesters near Nancefield Hostel, Soweto, on Wednesday night. The residents, furious about power cuts in the area, also stoned 10 cars at the nearby City Parks depot. Cops were able to save a third car and its owner from being torched.   When the SunTeam visited the hostel yesterday morning, residents said they didn’t want to be taken for granted. One of the residents said: “Who said just because we live in a hostel we have to be in the dark?” There were reports the protesters also stoned cars outside the City Power depot in Klipspruit and assaulted security guards. City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena appealed to residents with information about the incident to come forward. “People who are suspected to have been part of a community protest over electricity stormed the depot near Nancefield Train Station on Wednesday, held up and allegedly assaulted the three security officials on site,” he said. Mangena said during the chaos, computers and a Toyota Quantum minibus were stolen and the windows of at least 15 cars were smashed. Gauteng Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a case of public violence was opened but no one had been arrested yet.
