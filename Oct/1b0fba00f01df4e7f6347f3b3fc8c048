IN the Bible, many scriptures warn people against eating pork as it is considered tainted. But a pastor shocked his congregants when he served pork skop as Holy Communion. Instead of serving wine and biscuits as Holy Communion, Prophet Rufus Phala of Ark Centre Ministry served skop to his congregants in Mamone Village in Sekhukhune, Limpopo on Sunday. He said he wanted to serve it raw, but the Holy Spirit told him to cook it. Phala said he admitted a pig was declared dirty by the Lord, but everybody including animals, were forgiven when Jesus died on the cross. “With our faith and belief, the skop we served during the service was the body of Christ after I prayed for it. Some people used biscuits and wine, I chose to use the skop and Grapetiser for the service,” he said.  Daily Sun published a story about the same prophet last year after he made congregants drink Dettol and Jik during a church service. Pastor Vusi Mashabane of Church On The Hill in Polokwane criticised Phala for using pork as Holy Communion. He said it was insensitive and disrespectful to the word of God.  “We strictly use bread that has no yeast and a liquid that represents blood as Holy Communion,” said Mashabane.
