THERE are fears that a serial killer is making Motherwell
his private graveyard. This after at least three women were killed. Terrified residents wonder if a serial killer is to blame
for the murder of the three women, between the ages of 22 and 43 in different
locations within Motherwell in Nelson Mandela Bay. Cops spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said three bodies
have been found this year in the area of Ikamvelihle police station in
Motherwell. She said: "In February a 43-year-old woman was found
semi-naked and murdered in a field near in NU8. She had sustained several stab
wounds to her neck.” "The second case was recorded in May when a badly
bruised and semi-naked body of a 21-year-old woman was found in the bushes in
Addo Road in the Ramaphosa area,” Naidu said. Naidu said the third partially decomposed body of a woman
was found in a bushy area in the Ramaphosa area not far from where the second
body was found in May. "In all cases, police suspect that the women may have
been raped, but DNA results are still pending," Naidu said. Naidu urged women to be extra cautious and not to walk alone
at night or engage in conversation with strangers. “Anyone who can assist with any information relating to the
murders or a possible suspect is asked to contact dectective Sergeant Elton Tau
of Ikamvelihle on 082 303 0432.”
