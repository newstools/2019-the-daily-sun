Nale was born in Sebokeng in the Vaal and as a youngster he
played for local amateur clubs such as Burning Spear FC. He was later in the
books of Orlando Pirates development structures but he did not make an
impression. He then played for Manning Rangers and City Pillars but it
was at Golden Arrows where he made a big impression in 2007.  Two seasons later, Kaizer Chiefs pounced and signed him. He arrived
at Amakhosi with a big bang and was a darling to the Chiefs die-hard supporters
because of his dribbling tricks and stunning goals. He spent five good years at Naturena before he departed for
Ajax Cape Town. His career took a dip and he ended up Mpumalanga Black Aces without
much success. With a bit of hard work, determination and consistency, he
could have easily been one of Mzansi best midfielders of his generation. Whatâ€™s your most memorable Abia Nale moment?
