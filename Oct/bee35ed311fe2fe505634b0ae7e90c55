FOR the past year, Skhumbuzo Bhebhe has been a miserable man. His ex stabbed him in his balls last September, leaving his 4-5 useless. The 40-year-old from Olievenhoutbosch in Tshwane lost one of his balls in the attack. “She disappeared for two days, and when she returned home she found me sleeping. “She joined me in bed and we argued about her disappearance. The next minute she held me and stabbed me in the balls. “I went to hospital protecting my injured balls with a plastic bag because they were falling off.” Skhumbuzo said he was admitted to Kalafong Hospital, but a few months later he got a new girlfriend and realised he couldn’t have sex anymore. “I’ve always wanted to have children, and my ex knew that. “What she did to me is breaking me apart,” he said. Skhumbuzo’s friend, Cleo Sibanda (32), said he took care of him after he came back from hospital. “It was a very hard time for him. I don’t know what caused the fight,” Cleo said. The ex-girlfriend, Annikie Makgabo, said she was protecting herself. “That man was abusive. I was trying to protect myself from him,” she said. Annikie said she tried to get a protection order against him, which proved she was the victim in the situation. Police spokeswoman Constable Ulrika van Dyk said no case relating to the matter was found in the police system. A medical doctor told Daily Sun Skhumbuzo needed to see a urologist. “If he has testicular torsion or orchitis, then his testicles could be affected,” said the doctor.
