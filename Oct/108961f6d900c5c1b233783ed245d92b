STOCK theft in the Eastern Cape has become a massive threat to emerging farmers’ profits. On Friday, over 100 stolen animals were recovered from two suspects in Qumbu, outside Mthatha. Out of the 54 sheep and 48 goats recovered, 14 sheep were positively indentified by the owner. Police spokesman Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana told Daily Sun: “The Qumbu, Mbizana, Maluti and Mthatha stock theft units held an operation targeting hot spots, leading to the arrest of two suspects. “First to be recovered were 54 sheep, found in possession of two suspects from Sulenkama between the ages of 22 and 33. “Another 48 goats were recovered at Etwa and impounded in Qumbu. Anyone with missing goats is invited to come and identify them. The suspects will soon appear in the Qumbu Magistrates Court on a charge of stock theft.” Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said: “We must combine strategies, resources and co-ordinate efforts to stop stock theft activities at all costs.”
