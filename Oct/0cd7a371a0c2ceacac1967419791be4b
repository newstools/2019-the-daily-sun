Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has said his mini budget, will likely not be delivered on October 30 as
previously announced, but on October 29. The minister was speaking at a media briefing on the state of the South
African economy on Thursday in Pretoria. "I need to say that the medium term budget policy statement is
likely to be presented earlier than the 30th of October," he told
journalists.  Mboweni said President Cyril Ramaphosa may be outside the country on
October 30. The new proposed date of October 29 will have to be confirmed by
Parliament. The Cabinet secretary is expected to make an announcement on the
new date later today. If the date is moved, it will be the second time that the mini budget
has been moved to accommodate the movements of Ramaphosa.  SOURCE: FIN24
