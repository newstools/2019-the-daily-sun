RESIDENTS woke up to find themselves without a Post Office on Tuesday morning. The Post Office in Dealesville, Free State, went up in flames in the early hours of Tuesday. Resident Thabang Mongana (43) said this meant he’d no longer be able to enter Daily Sun competitions. “My favourite competition is the grocery voucher one. I posted five entries on Monday and I’m sad they weren’t sent away. I hope those responsible for this will be held accountable,” he said. Gogo Seamogeleng Pitso (70) said she was worried she wouldn’t get her grant. “I hope government makes a plan soon,” she said. A cop said everything was burnt to ashes. “This is a very small town. Most residents depend on the Post Office for doing things like transferring money. “Motorists will have to drive to Bloemfontein or Kimberley to renew their licence discs,” he said. “It’s not clear what caused the fire.” SA Post Office area manager Rosy Senyang confirmed the incident. “A forensic team is at the Post Office to establish the cause of the fire. Special arrangements will be made for the payment of Sassa grants later this week,” she said. “We’re also looking at ways to make postal services available, probably by means of a mobile Post Office.” Provincial Hawks spokeswoman Linda Steyn said a forensic probe would determine whether a case of arson or malicious damage to property would be opened.
