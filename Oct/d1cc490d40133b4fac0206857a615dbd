FREE State Transport MEC Sam Mashinini launched the province’s Transport Month in Senekal on Tuesday. He was accompanied by Premier Sisi Ntombela, Speaker of the Legislature Ntombizanele Sefuba, Rural Development MEC William Bulwana and Free State deputy director-general Kopung Radikontsane. Mashinini also officially opened the upgraded N5 traffic control centre in Senekal in partnership with Sanral. The centre has been upgraded to a more technologically advanced weighbridge. Mashinini said: “The purpose is to make sure our roads, particularly the N8, N1 and N5, are safe. “We’re going to ensure motorists drive carefully. If they continuously break the law, their points will be deducted and it will get to a point where their driver’s licences will be taken away from them.” He said there would be harsh punishment for motorists who drove under the influence of alcohol. “We’re going to take their cars and sentence them to five years’ imprisonment,” said Mashinini. Ntombela said her main focus was to create employment. “We officially opened the weighbridge to ensure the people of Senekal get employment. The rate of youth unemployment in the Free State is too high,” she said. “This weighbridge will ensure all vehicles passing through are carrying the required load. If not, the drivers will be prosecuted.”
