KAIZER Chiefs star Siyabonga Ngezana is aware that football is a short career that could come to an end at any time. That is why the 22-year-old has decided to prepare himself for life after football by furthering his studies. Ngezana, who is currently studying Sports Management, wants to give himself something to fall back on should things not go as planned. However, the Amakhosi Youth Academy graduate, who also represents the South Africa Under-23 national men’s team, insists it is not easy to balance academics and football. Nevertheless, Ngezana is determined to succeed in both. “I find my studies interesting,” Ngezana told the Kazier Chiefs website. “It is so far so good to be studying Sports Management. But it is challenging because of the balancing act that is involved in my life at the moment. “The balance is key because I have to focus on my studies while at the same getting regular call ups to the national team. I’m driven by passion and dedication to achieve my dreams. I have to focus on all fronts to reach my goals. “I want to give my studies all my best while at the same time not neglecting my football career. Education and football go hand in glove for me.” Ngezana also shared some words of advice to students who will be writing their exams. He also encouraged those who are battling to find a balance between books and their careers. “Have passion, be dedicated and work hard to achieve your dreams. It takes belief in yourself and putting more work in the studies. Mostly focus and know that there’s life after football. And I wish everyone sitting for exams during this period all of the best.”
