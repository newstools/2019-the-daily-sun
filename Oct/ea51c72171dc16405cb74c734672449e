RESIDENTS of Rietpan were furious when they found the driver of a truck that killed eight local children didn’t have a licence. North West police yesterday said the 26-year-old would appear in Lehurutshe Magistrates Court today. READ: DRIVER FACES CULPABLE HOMICIDE CHARGES Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said: “He failed to produce a licence. It came out during the investigation he was a learner driver.” The accident happened on Saturday while the kids were returning from a soccer match in Borakalalo. At a community meeting yesterday, residents demanded the soccer coach who organised the trip explain how he allowed someone without a licence to drive children. They were traumatised to hear Goitseone Setsome (13) had died in hospital. He was one of the 20 children admitted after the driver lost control and drove into a tree. Goitseone’s uncle Modise Setsome said the family’d hoped he would survive. “We’re speechless.” Resident Tshidi Mooki said: “To hear the driver didn’t have a licence makes us sick.” The North West Education Department said a memorial service will be held at Letlhakane Primary School in Rietpan today at 10am.
