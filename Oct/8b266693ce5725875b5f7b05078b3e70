RESIDENTS are battling to breathe because of sewage running through their kasi. They said the municipality’s failure to collect rubbish has made the situation worse.  Residents of Moses Mabhida zone 4 in Kirkwood, Eastern Cape, claim the situation has affected their pig business. They said the pigs drank the sewage water and ate food residents dumped in the streams. Xolani Langbooi (35) said they eat the pigs anyway.  He told Daily Sun: “Since 2010 we’ve been experiencing overflow drains ekasi. When drains in upper level areas such as Ntakazilali, Bhongweni and Ethembeni become blocked, all the raw sewage overflows into our area at the lower level.” They reported the matter to the municipality daily.
