EVERY day of the week Nonhlahla Sithole wakes up early to prepare food that she sells in the busy streets of Jozi. She only spends about R60 on transport and R30 on lunch daily, and R150 goes to her money box and the rest she uses to buy stock. She said: “When I was still at school my teacher once said although we come from poor families, most of us can make sure every day we save some of our lunch money. “I don’t use up all the money I have. I always have cash to buy new stock.” Nonhlanhla’s money tips: Buy consumables such as toilet paper, coffee and stationery in bulk and keep your eyes open for discounted offers when you need to stock up. Buying no-name goods rather than well-known brands when they’re functionally identical can be a real cost saver. Look out for gently used second-hand goods that are cheaper to buy or lease. Monitor activities on your bank account. Consider purchasing a cloud-based (online) accounting and payroll solution to automate. Look at what you’re paying for banking, mobile data and telephone, insurance and other essential services. Find out if your package suits your needs. If there are people on your team who could do their work from home, or spend most of their time on the road, offer them the option to work remotely.
