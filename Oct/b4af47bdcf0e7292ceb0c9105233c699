BAFANA Mncube (27) and Ntando Ndlovu (31) are heartbroken. A woman asked to use a toilet at the house where their baby was being looked after but took off with the child. Eight-month-old Nompumelelo Mncube was stolen by an unknown woman in Meadowlands, Soweto, on Friday. The couple said they left their daughter in the care of a nanny every morning. But on Friday an unknown woman asked to use the toilet at the nanny’s house and snatched their baby. According to the nanny, Jennifer Ncube (42), it was not the first time the unknown woman came to her house. She recognised her face but didn’t know where she lived. “I allowed her to use the toilet as she seemed pressed. The baby was sleeping in the bedroom when the woman went to the toilet,” she said. Jennifer said a few seconds later she went to another outside toilet. “When I came back my eyes went straight to the bedroom where the baby was sleeping, but she wasn’t there,” she said. “I went straight to the toilet to check the woman, but she wasn’t there. I called the mum and asked her to rush back home.” Ntando said: “The only thing I want is for my baby to be brought back home.” Sergeant Octavia Thebe said a case of child abduction was opened.
