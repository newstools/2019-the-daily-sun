SPORT is a universal language that connects people regardless of their origin, background, religious belief and economic position. To bare testimony to that, on Sunday, rugby and boxing enthusiasts will be under one roof rallying behind their sporting heroes at Time Square, Menlyn Tshwane. They will first watch Rugby World Cup quarter final between the Springboks and the host nation Japan on a big screen before having a five bout mouth-watering boxing feast. According to promoter Jani Hebler of 5TH Elements Boxing Promotions, the idea is to use sport as a vehicle to unite people across the board. “Sport has the ability to bring unity. With this idea, we want to inspire our communities to unite through sport. It does not matter which part of the country you come from or your background, sport bring us together and championship sport unite the country,” said Hebler. The budding boxing promoter is expecting about 400 rugby fans to join the boxing community on her “Battle of the Warriors 5” boxing showpiece. There will be a hive of activities, such as dance, to cheer up the audience throughout the day. Hebler is anticipating an action-packed boxing event with her evenly matched fight card. Topping the bill is a much-talked about middleweight championship showdown between two boxing friends, Walter “Black Mamba” Dlamini and Nkululeko “The Bulldog” Mhlongo. Dlamini’s titles, South African and World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African middleweight belts, will be the bone of contention between these two gladiators. On the main supporting bout, national cruiserweight title holder Thabiso Mchunu expected to face off with the Namibian Willbeforce Shihepo on an eight round non-title contest. On a first female bout to be featured at 5th Element show, Smangele Hadebe will lock horns with arch-rival Thema Zuma in a super flyweight division over eight rounds. Other bouts: junior middleweight Shevontaich v Wandile Ndlela, junior lightweight Anthony Grobler v Ramsy Hlungwana.
