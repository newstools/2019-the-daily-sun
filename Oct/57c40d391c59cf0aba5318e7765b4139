THERE was a lot happening this week. So, after a chilled rooftop vibes at Gallo for Lungisa Xhamela’s Launch, I was invited to the launch of the new Converse store in Fourways, north of Jozi. As the cultured girl I am, I put on my dope converse sneakers for the occasion. I anticipated an event with many influencers (because you find them everywhere these days), a few celebrities and media. Wait, is the media still relevant? Any-way, it was a nice intimate set up with a nice range of beautiful kicks. And yes, there was a boat load of influencers. Guess Fourways is too far for the real showbiz crowd. I think he lives nearby because he was dressed like he just came from a jog. Hayini! What’s she doing these days, except for hanging out with Big Zulu? Shame, the poor girl was swallowed by her clothes. I couldn’t help but wonder if she’d had enough to eat while she was heavy on the glass. I got my new sneakers but a free pair would be nice . . . looking atcha converse. But yeah, got them because there was a 30% discount on all the sneakers. They had Gent Sibiya, popular for custom-painting sneakers and I love the Ndebele pattern on my white shoes.
