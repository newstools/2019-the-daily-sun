THE DA plans to use technology in the fight against farm attacks and stock theft. Shadow police minister Andrew Whitfield, shadow agriculture minister Annette Steyn and Western Cape Agriculture MEC Ivan Meyer briefed the media on the party’s plans. Whitfield said: “By equipping a drone with thermal imaging, night vision and infrared imaging technology, it can be possible for suspects to be identified and pursued in any condition, and at any time of day.” Steyn said South Africa lost R3 million a day due to stock theft, but in most cases these crimes weren’t even reported to the cops as they weren’t taken seriously. “They won’t even open a case when you come to report one or three of your sheep were stolen. I think people don’t understand the economic value of livestock.” Steyn said according to recent crime stats, more than 29 000 cases of stock theft were reported. “They bring a truck and load 200 to 300 sheep a night,” she said. “A small farmer could lose his flock in one night and become bankrupt. Meyer said he’d make sure courts didn’t grant bail to farm attackers. “I’m opposing bail for anybody who attacks a farmer or farmworker,” he said. “I was in court last Monday in Franschhoek and I’ll be back in two weeks. “We’re taking this to the courts because we want justice for our people living in rural areas.”
