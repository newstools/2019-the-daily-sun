SUMMER will always be a season that plays havoc with body temperature levels. Evaporation of the sweat cools the skin, which in turn helps cool the entire body. Drinking water helps restore lost fluids through excessive sweating. Not drinking enough water results in dehydration. The combination of hot temperatures and dehydration can lead to serious heat-related illnesses. Children and older adults are especially at risk of becoming dehydrated. To prevent dehydration, drink water throughout the day. Fruits, vegetables and milk are also good for helping the body retain its water levels. Simon Letlhabi said: “I carry a bottle of water daily to work to ensure I don’t get dehydrated.” “Every morning before I go to work I run for a kilometre or two depending on what time did I wake up and water is important as a get dry while jogging. Agnes Monaheng from Tshwane said: “Lately, we’ve been experiencing a heat wave across the country. Hence I drink lots of water.” The South African Guidelines for Healthy Eating and Food Guide, recommends drinking six to eight glasses of water a day. “Eight glasses is around two litres, or three and a half pints. This is enough to replace the water your body loses every day through processes such as sweating, urinating and breathing.
