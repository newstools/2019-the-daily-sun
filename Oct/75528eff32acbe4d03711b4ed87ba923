BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki was pleased to see Percy Tau gain some invaluable experience at the highest level in club football. Tau made his much anticipated Uefa Champions League bow for Belgian outfit Club Brugge during their impressive 2-2 draw with Spanish giants Real Madrid on Tuesday. Ntseki believes the experience will serve Tau well in his career and is expecting him to be full of confidence when he reports for international duty. Tau will be linking up with his Bafana teammates during the international break as they prepare to face Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge. The match will take place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth next Sunday (3pm). “We are expecting a very confident Tau coming to represent his country,” said Ntseki. “And I know for a fact that whenever he is in the squad, he wants to play, he wants to give his best and wear the jersey with pride because he respects the badge and the colours of his country. We are hoping that his confidence will rub off on the rest of the squad.” Ntseki said he has not been surprised by how quickly Tau has settled to life in Europe. “I know him to be a very cool headed person, somebody who wants to achieve more in his career,” added Ntseki. “I was not surprised to see him doing well when he arrived in Belgium in his first season. He is doing well now with Club Brugge, he is our ambassador. If any of our players is excelling abroad it benefits the whole country and all the players of his generation.”
