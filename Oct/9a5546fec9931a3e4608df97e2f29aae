MAGOSHAS working along the Old Heidelberg Road in Joburg need a place to poke when they find customers. Now people who own back rooms are making a living from the magoshas by giving them a “sex stadium”.  One owner chose to bring prices down to survive. “Magoshas pay as little as R10. Half a loaf is better than nothing. If I don’t do this, I’ll be out of business,” said Tommy Bothas. “It’s hard and we’re not making much money. Magoshas control the price and we have to comply because they give us something.” Another backroom owner, Simon Sibanyoni, said he once tried to raise the price to R30 a bed, but had to bring it down to survive. Another owner Sarah Ngomane said: “There’s many of us in this area. Demanding more money kills your business.” Magoshas told Daily Sun their customers liked the area as it was isolated. They used to service their customers in the bushes, but cops insisted they use houses in plots after some of them got robbed. They charged customers R50 for service and R10 for the stadium. A magosha said: “They know they have to pay. Where else are we going to do the job? They don’t complain because they know they’re going to get a proper service.” Another magosha said: “Stadium owners make something as we bring customers to their places.”
