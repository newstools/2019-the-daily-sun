BAROKA FC coach Wedson Nyirenda has sent a stern warning to other PSL teams, stating that the Telkom Knockout trophy is off limits. The draw for this year’s TKO takes place midweek – with the Last-16 fixtures scheduled for the weekend of 19 and 22 October. And Nyirenda won’t let his big-club coaching career opportunity slip away. Last season, Bakgaga shocked the soccer fraternity when they upset Orlando Pirates and won the TKO. That victory was also recorded in history books as they became the first Limpopo club to win a knockout trophy in the PSL era. Said Nyirenda: “We’re going all out. This is our cup. “The best we can do is taking part in the final and see what happens.” Toward the final, Baroka floored heavyweights Mamelodi Sundowns. And Nyirenda insists nothing will stop them from repeating the same feat. “If we don’t defend our cup, we’ll go for the Nedbank Cup,” Nyirenda warned. As things stand, it’s not smooth sailing for Baroka this season in the league. They are smarting from a 1-0 loss to Maritzburg United, their third loss on the trot. The Fifa international break will give Nyirenda a chance for a mini pre-season – to allow him to iron out a few kinks. But the mentor is not so keen. “I don’t think we want the break. We’re now on handbrake and we need to restart the engine,” he said. “We need rhythm. You play two games and go three weeks out, this is too much. “We’ve had three Fifa calendars and are only seven or eight games into the season. “I think we can defend the Cup. If we don’t, we should go for the Nedbank Cup,” he said.
