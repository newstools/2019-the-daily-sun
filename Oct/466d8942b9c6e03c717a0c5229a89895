LEAVE me alone! Let me live my life! This is the call from Lehlogonolo “Hlogi Majaivane” Mashigo (20), the Basetsana and Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies soccer player. Lehlogonolo said she was tired of being humiliated for being a lesbian and sick of people trying to pull her down.  Lehlogonolo, from Mamelodi East in Tshwane, played against Cameroon in the All Africa Games in Morocco last month. Last weekend, she played for Sundowns when they beat Tsunami Queens 2-1 at Tsakane Stadium, scoring a goal during the game. She said she was fed up with people who gossiped about her life and career and who judged her. She said she hated that people talked about her, adding sadly that she avoided people by locking herself in her room. “I’m happy with the way I am. I’m a product of God. People should be supportive about my career, not be judgemental. “I’m the same Lehlogonolo who play for Sundowns and South Africa women Under-20. Nothing can change that. I’m still humble, friendly and loving.” She said she will continue living a clean life. “I want people to respect and support me,” she said. Lehlogonolo said she used football to inspire young people. Her ambition was to play for Banyana Banyana and an overseas team such as AC Milan. Her company, Legs on the Beat Entertainment, promotes dancing, music and the arts and she would like the youth to join. She’s also planning a talent search that will take place in all provinces.
