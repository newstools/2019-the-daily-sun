CARRIE Gracie’s Equal is a revolutionary book that strives for change in terms of gender inequality. In Mzansi, The Employment Equity Amendment Act, 47 of 2013 [EEA] and the Employment Equity Regulations, 2014 [EER] came into effect on 1 August 2014. But statistics covering 70 countries and 80% of wage employees worldwide show on average women continue to be paid 28% less than men. And Mzansi has the world’s highest wage inequality overall as South African women, who are permanently employed, earn 22,7% less than men. Mzansi women, who workpart-time, earn 39% less than men do. Mzansi came in as the second-worst country surveyed for part-time wage inequality. Pakistan was at 77,4%. Inequality in the workplace has been a big concern in the world. Carrie gets into the topic and gives some interesting and important insight on it. Equal is about her personal experiences with gender inequality in the workplace. And in this book, she tackles what she calls “pay discrimination over genders”. This is her attempt to help us understand that it’s okay for colleagues to discuss their salaries with each other and stand up against pay discrimination over genders. This doesn’t only advocate for equal pay for equal work. It’s, indeed, a gift for women and men in the workplace, as well as male and female employers.
