GOLDEN Arrows coach Steve Komphela is a very big fan of Polokwane City. The consistency and dedication by the players is something that he wants to copy at Arrows, where players are kept together for years. The former Maritzburg United coach says Rise and Shine, whose squad has been together for over four years, don’t need much coaching. The Limpopo-based outfit was originally assembled by Luc Eymael, who guided City to their first ever top eight finish in the 2016-17 season. Then last season, under Jozef Vukusic, they did ever better with the same squad by finishing fifth in the Absa Premiership. Rise and Shine are in fourth position at present after eight matches. The signs are positive that they can once again finish in the top eight under Serbian coach Zlatco Krmpotic. Komphela believes he could make players like Nduduzo Sibiya, Sibusiso Sibeko, Lindokuhle Mtshali, Michael Gumede, Seth Perusnath, Siphelele Magubane, Velemseni Ndwandwe, Sanele Mathenjwa and Siboniso Conco fly under his wing. Said Komphela:“I wish one day I can have a team of Magubane, Conco, Sibiya and Mathenjwa, and hit the same level.” Arrows host Polokwane in their Premiership clash at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). And Komphela is hoping for history to repeat itself. Last Saturday Arrows defeated City 1-0 in the Telkom Knockout last-16 at the same venue. Komphela is happy with his squad: “This Arrows side is a massively talented team. It is just a question of giving them confidence.” Komphela also dreams of an all KwaZulu Natal Knockout final against Maritzburg United. Arrows were drawn away against SuperSport United when the quarter-final draw was made on Tuesday night, while Maritzburg will play Highlands Park at home next weekend. “Can you imagine the final between Maritzburg and Arrows? It’ll be nice,” Komphela said. “Why can’t it be? Dreams do come true.”
