THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) acting CEO, Mato Madlala, has indicated that they are still very far from considering the usage of the controversial Video Assistant Referees (VAR) in the PSL. Madlala said this amid calls that referees in the PSL need help, especially coming from the week where Mamemlodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane was left furious, accusing Victory Hlungwani of having allowed a goal that was offside, in their 2-0 loss to Kaizer Chiefs. Mosimane was convinced that the first Chiefs goal, scored by Samir Nurkovic, was offside but it later emerged it was legit. Madlala said that to have VAR in the PSL, they will need to have a technical centre that will work with cameras at the stadiums, like in England. She also mentioned that clubs in Mzansi don’t have their own stadiums, and they move from one place to another, which is a challenge on its own. “It’s not about us being ready to have VAR, there are lot of logistical challenges that we are facing as the league,” charged Madlala. “There’s no single venue that is football owned in this country, which is crazy. We (football) are the biggest supported sport, but we don’t own a single venue. We do not have a Wembley (the stadium that belongs to English FA and only cater for football). If you look around the world countries that have installed VAR, venues are owned by clubs. Sadly in South Africa we don’t. We move from one venue to another. So where can you install VAR?” Yesterday, Safa Review Committee confirmed that the first goal scored by Nurkovic was legitimate. Madlala, who gave the thumbs up to Safa’s decision, added that referees are also “human” and are bound to make mistakes. “I heard in the media about it... ,” said Madlala referring to Mosimane, who warned teams to be wary of match officials while playing against Chiefs. “At times when you look at the games, you can see that it is human mistake. I hope that it is all human errors and this weekend there will be less of those.”
