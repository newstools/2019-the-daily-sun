THE FAMILY of late Senzo Meyiwa wants President Cyril Ramaphosa
to assist them in Senzo's murder case. The family said they want president Ramaphosa to intervene for
them to find out with National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) what is going on
with the case. The family said this in a media briefing they held at Senzo's
home in K section Umlazi south of Durban today. Senzo's brother Sifiso Meyiwa said they are calling on the
president to intervene or else AfriForum will intervene. He said there are many other organisations from African
countries and overseas that are willing to help in this matter if this case
still does not continue. He said those police should be arrested because they are the
ones who ruined the case from the beginning.  "This case has been dragging for several years now and we
want justice. I will fight it until the end. They killed my brother and my
father also died a worried man because of this so they will not kill me, I will
fight until the end," he said. He said he has been contacted by several organisations he wonâ€™t
mention that are willing to help in this case. "My brother was loved by many people. They are now willing
to come forward and assist them. "The only thing we want is justice for my brother," he
said. He further said the minister of police Bheki Cele has done
everything in assisting regarding this case but now the holdup is with the NPA. "People involved in the death of my brother will all be
arrested. Their families will cry like how my family cried," he said. Senzo was shot dead in his girlfriend's home Kelly Khulamo in
Vosloorus in 26 October 2014. His father Sam Meyiwa died in July this year.
