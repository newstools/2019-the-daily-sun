 THE case against Mamelodi taxi boss, Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela and his three co-accused, has been postponed to 13 January. Khekhe, Sipho Hudla, Matamela Mutapa and Bonginkosi Khumalo face charges of murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. They’re accused of killing North West businessman Wandile Bozwana. Yesterday, a nursing sister was questioned at a correctional facility to find out if Hudla and Mutapa were tortured into confessing to the murder, and whether Khumalo was tortured to make a warning statement.  Khekhe, Elias Skhosana and Stemmer Monageng also face separate charges of extortion, intimidation and assault. They are accused of threatening business people and taxi operators in Mamelodi, Tshwane to pay protection money. During Police Minister Bheki Cele’s visit to the kasi earlier this year, residents complained about the matter. As a result, the tactical response team was sent to Mamelodi to deal with crime. Cele and Gauteng Premier David Makhura welcomed Khekhe’s arrest in March. Gauteng cops have broadened their investigation to look into how Khekhe allegedly took all the money belonging to a taxi association in Mamelodi. He’ll appear in the Pretoria Magistrates Court on 21 October for two more cases of assault and intimidating a witness in the Bozwana murder case.
