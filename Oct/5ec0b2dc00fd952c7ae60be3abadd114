RADIO personality and businessman Tbo Touch is gearing himself up for the release of his movie Blessers, which stars some of Mzansi’s most prolific actors. Touch (real name Thabo Molefe) told Sunday Sun the movie aims to tell the narrative about blessers. “I wanted to tackle the issue of blessers that’s so prevalent in our society because we have a situation where men use their power to lure young girls,” said Touch. “I want people, including the old men who prey on young girls, to go out and watch the movie because it talks about them and the friends who sell others because they want to benefit.” He said he wanted to tell this story in a fun manner that resonates with South Africans. “We have slay queens who would do anything to lead a glamorous lifestyle and enablers who are rich men taking advantage of vulnerable young girls.” Touch, who was recently appointed as the CEO of Soweto TV, said: “I’m working on another movie, which is currently in production. “I’m also producing Robbie Malinga Junior’s reality show, which premieres soon.” Touch reckons black entertainers are not prioritised in the industry because “we have the likes of Mam’ Connie Chiume, who has been acting for 38 years, but lives from one script to another”. “We don’t even have black movie distributors. We get excited about our work being on Netflix but aren’t making money from it,” said Touch. Blessers is set for national release on 25 October.
