LAST year, Intsebenziswano Senior Secondary School in Philippi was put on the map after matric pupil Kamva Goso got seven distinctions. Now principal Moipone Sam believes top pupils Mthobeni Mhlabeni (17), Bhukho Ndziweni (18) and Sanele Manyela (18) will also make the school proud. “Bhukho is doing well so far. He balances all the subjects well and I really hope he’ll follow in Kamva’s footsteps.” Sam said a certain hardworking group had what it took to pass matric very well. “This group has been dedicated since grade 10. They respect time, their teachers and they work hard. They help with extra lessons and never miss class,” she said. Although there aren’t any girls in the group, Sam said she always challenged girl pupils to rise to the challenge. “I don’t know what distracts the girls from performing well. Maybe they’ll surprise us.” Mthobeni, who’s originally from Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape, told Daily Sun he was number 10 in the first term and second in term two. “I studied alone when I arrived in Cape Town this year. “I then became friends with Bukho and Sanele when I became number 10 as they were top pupils. We study at the library and also spoke about our challenges,” said Mhlabeni. Bhukho said: “I want to get seven distinctions. I want to be the first person in my family to go to university.” Sanele said he was happy to work with his two friends. “We push ourselves to our limits and I believe it will pay off,” he said.
