DON’T judge rape victims on how they’re dressed! This was Police Minister Bheki Cele’s advice to cops. Cele said yesterday they must stop being fashion police when dealing with victims of rape. “You aren’t a fashion designer. Don’t ask women if that’s how they should dress. “It’s not your business to ask a woman about her dress code.” Cele was briefing cops during a march against gender-based violence in Tshwane. The men in blue were joined by the Tshwane Metro police, Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority, Ipid, organisations against gender-based violence and taximen. They marched from the Tshwane CBD to the Sunnyside cop shop to see how victims of gender-based violence were treated at police stations. Cele, accompanied by his deputy Cassel Mathale, told cops police stations should be safe havens for every woman who reports a crime. “Never tell women who report rape to go back and negotiate with her abuser. “That’s not your job. Your job is protect and make sure those people are arrested. “If you think your job is to negotiate, you should come to me and I’ll send you to South Sudan or Syria to go negotiate there.” Well-known personality Mveleli “Dr Love” Gqwede also took part in the march. He pleaded with the police to stop victimising people when they open cases. He said even the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Intersex group deserved the same respect. “Just because we’re of a different sexual orientation doesn’t mean our abuses are different from others. “Please offer us the protection we need.” After the march, the police again pledged to continue their fight against gender-based violence.
