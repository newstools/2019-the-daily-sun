HE QUIT his job thinking he was going to work at Emfuleni Local Municipality in the Vaal, south of Joburg. But he was shattered when he realised there was no job waiting for him, despite having paid R50 000! Now the 32-year-old man from Soweto is unemployed and broke. He said a relative promised him a better job at the municipality. He was not the only one who was scammed. Another man (28) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he paid R40 000 but never got the job. “I was shocked to get an SMS saying I got the job at the municipality. That’s how the man got in touch with me,” he said. Following a tip-off, a private investigator from the municipality arrested the scammer on Saturday. The man confessed he worked with three officials from the municipality. Emfuleni spokesman Sonqoba Kunene warned: “Jobs at Emfuleni are free. If there ain’t any circulars, this means the municipality isn’t employing.” Vanderbijlpark police spokeswoman Sergeant Gertrude Makhale confirmed a case of fraud was opened. “A suspect was arrested and appeared in court yesterday,” she said.
