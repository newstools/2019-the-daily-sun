DURING his annual judiciary report yesterday, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng revealed he turned down an offer of R600 million to modernise courts. Speaking at the Constitutional Court in Joburg, Mogoeng said: “I rejected it with the necessary contempt it deserves, because that’s how capture happens.” Mogoeng said the judiciary had never been scared to hold its own to account. He said judges were also citizens who should be criticised when they’re wrong. He said he hoped the case of former judge Nkola Motata, bust for drunk driving 12 years ago, would be finalised next week. Speaking about allegations of corruption involving judges and the CR17 campaign, he said the court wrote to the police commissioner to follow up on the matter. “We say anybody with evidence must come forward so we can kick out the rotten apples.” Mogoeng said the justice system needed well-trained investigating officers to deal with violence against women. “These matters have given us a lot of stress. We also need specialised prosecutors,” he said.
