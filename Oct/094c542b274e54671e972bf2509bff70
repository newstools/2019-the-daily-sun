Furthermore, they said, as actors themselves, were aware of the of the industry dynamics. Read the statement: "We support 100% the need for the industry to be regulated and for the Performance Protection  Amendment Bill to be signed sooner rather than later. We attempted to negotiate with the actress and her agent and they made it clear that Miss Ndara wouldn’t accept anything less that R700 000 for the five-week shoot. "She absolutely had the right to decline the offer, which she did and we on the other hand, had the every right to move on amicably."
