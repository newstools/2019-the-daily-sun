He said people love his atchar because it’s tasty. Sometimes people don’t even buy his atchar but they pay him for looking good. “When clients see you, they see food. They must know the food is made with love and is clean,” said Thulani. He told Daily Sun not making sales doesn’t destroy his spirit. “Not everybody can afford my food. Some people even give me money to support me.” Thulani prepares his atchar in 20-litre buckets and sells about three buckets a day. He makes around R300 profit a bucket. “This motivates me to get up every day and do my job,” said Thulani. “I don’t need to look for a job. “Instead I wake up, clean up and get down to work. “I make more money than many people who work for bosses.”
