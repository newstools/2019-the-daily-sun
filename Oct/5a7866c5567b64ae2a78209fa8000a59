“CHURCH noise must fall.” These were the words of Yeoville, Joburg, residents who were celebrating as at least 20 churches in the area were being raided during a joint operation by JMPD and SAPS on Sunday. The residents said they just wanted to be bhabalazed in peace.  Resident Ntombifuthi Makhoba said: “We can’t enjoy our booze in peace. Please keep arresting them. These so-called churches are also illegal businesses used for money laundering. Close them all.” Another resident, Muzikayifani Malinga, said he couldn’t even poke in peace. “We hear them preaching about sinners while we’re busy poking before marriage. This turns us off,” he said. Bishop Thulani Matebane from Daveyton said pastors should stop establishing churches in areas not zoned for worshipping purposes. But a church member, Nombeko Deda, ridiculed the cops’ work. “Confiscating pulpits and keyboards when there are guns and drugs out there is not fair,” said Nombeko. JMPD spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnar said about R500 000 worth of equipment was confiscated during the raids. He said the raids came about after numerous complaints of loud music and overcrowding of pavements were received from the community. Daily Sun couldn’t reach the leaders of the raided churches, which are unregistered.
