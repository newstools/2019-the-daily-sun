AUDITOR-GENERAL Kimi Makwetu is concerned that irregular and wasteful expenditure by government departments has increased by more than R10 billion. MAIMANE AND TROLLIP QUIT THE DA! Speaking to Parliament’s standing committee on public accounts yesterday, he said in the last year, irregular expenditure had increased from R50,1 billion to R61 billion. Makwetu said the biggest culprits were KZN and Gauteng, with irregular expenditure of R12 billion and R11 billion. “If we look at the total contributors, you’ll see that quite a large concentration of this is in KZN, followed by a number of national government departments and Gauteng.” EASTERN CAPE DECLARED A DISASTER PROVINCE! He said the provincial departments with the most irregular expenditure were both KZN and Gauteng’s health and transport departments. Nationally, the water and sanitation department was a huge contributor. Makwetu said in the last financial year alone, government guaranteed a whopping R446 billion to state-owned companies, with the lion’s share going to Eskom.
