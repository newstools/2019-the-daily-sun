SPORTS minister Nathi Mthethwa says South Africa Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) will be implementing the recommendations of the Zulman Commission. The commission was tasked by the previous minister to investigate among others, allegations of maladministration and financial irregularities at the Olympics body. The inquiry found that there was no compliance with the basic principles of ethics, transparency, accountability and good governance, or with policies and procedures of managing the affairs of Sascoc. Addressing the media after the meeting with athletics officials in Joburg on Monday, Mthethwa explained that Sascoc annual general meeting (AGM), initially pencilled in for November next year, would be brought forward to March. This would be done to “respond to the current challenges” afflicting the organisation. “This is to accelerate the process of cleansing the negativity around Sascoc,” Mthethwa explained. “We are in agreement that something has to happen and happen quickly, as the Zulman report recommends. We want to see change and see Sascoc moving based on the commission recommendations.” Sascoc deputy president Barry Hendricks, who sat alongside Mthethwa, echoed the minister’s sentiment. “We walk away from this meeting unified,” he said. “The sooner we have change, the better it will be for us as a brand and regain the confidence people had in us. We are with the minister and we will ensure change is effected at Sascoc.”
