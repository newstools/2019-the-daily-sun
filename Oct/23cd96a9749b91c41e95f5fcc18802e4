UlangaBar, the mobile bar brand popular for giving unconventional titles to its signature cocktails and tending to thirst at corporate and private functions, has planned a big all-inclusive shindig for its 4th annual beer festival.“In the true spirit of an authentic beer festival, we have enlisted four top black-owned craft brewers to delight our beer lovers,” says Lesiba Langa, founder of UlangaBar Beer Festival. “The brewers are Imbombi, Stimela, Mamelodi Lager and Mbokodo, a product of a female-owned brewing company. Being a cocktail bar as well, we have prepared a special treat for cocktail enthusiasts.”UlangaBar’s popularity is partially credited to the unusual naming of its original cocktails. Last year, the mobile bar brand set tongues wagging for its signature cocktails that were named ‘Ko Mkokotlong,’ ‘Hlaudi,’ ‘Mavuso’ and ‘Rosalia – Ha Monate Jwang’ to name a few. “As per tradition, we will launch our brand new range of summer cocktails at the event and are excited to unveil yet another brand of names that will get the public talking,” adds Langa.UlangaBar Beer Festival will also feature a mixology class where attendees will learn on how to make home-made cocktails as good as UlangaBar does.  Gin consumers will be spoilt or choice of various Gin craft on the day.As per norm, UlangaBar BeerFestival will feature live entertainment, top grade food stalls including SA’s with delectable gourmet food and snacks. “In aligning ourselves to the concept of family time, we have made provision for a safe and secure Kids Zone where children can play and socialise under tight supervision.”The 4th annual UlangaBar BeerFest is set to take place on the 26th of October 2019 at the River Cabin in the outskirts of Fourways. Tickets are available for sale via Webtickets outlets for R150. For more infomation, follow @ulangabar on Facebook, Instagram & Twitter and join the conversation using #UlangaBeerFest.
