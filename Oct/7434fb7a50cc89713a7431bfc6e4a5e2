PALO Rabodinyane didn’t know whether he should feel happy or sad. He escaped being killed along with his sister and her boyfriend when he was sent to buy a razor blade at a nearby shop on Saturday night. The 25-year-old told Daily Sun soon after he left, armed men entered the family home in Serwalo in Thaba Nchu, Free State, and killed his sister, Anna (30) and her boyfriend, Moferefere Lebakeng (32). “Moferefere wanted a razor to shave his hair and sent me to the shop to buy it. I didn’t want to go and told him I’d go in the morning, but he insisted,” he said. Palo told the SunTeam he was shocked when he returned to find a crowd outside his house. “I heard the men came knocking after I left and when Moferefere opened the door, he was gunned down. My sister and her boyfriend were found dead in the sitting room,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said cops were looking for the suspects. “Two murder cases have been opened, but no one has been arrested. At this stage, police are asking anyone with information to contact Detective Constable Kebogile Diseko on 082 553 8208,” he said. Makhele said the shooting was the second in the area in three days. “On Wednesday, two women were shot. “A 54-year-old was declared dead on the scene and a 55-year-old was in hospital in a stable condition,” he said.
