NOTHING beats the feeling of scoring the winning goal in a major cup final! Just ask SuperSport United’s goal poacher Bradley Grobler and he will tell you. The former Platinum Stars star was the hero for Matsatsantsa a Pitori on Saturday as they defeated Highlands Park 1-0 in the MTN8 Cup final at the Orlando Stadium. Grobler headed in Teboho Mokoena’s cross to score the winner in added time in the first half. He pocketed a cool R25 000 cheque from the sponsors, who pledged to pay that amount for every goal scored in the final. An excited Grobler, is on top of the world with the way things are going for him. The modest striker dedicated the cup triumph to coach Kaitano Tembo, who bagged his first major trophy since he took over the reins at start of last season. Grobler declared that Tembo should be widely celebrated by Matsatsantsa a Pitori faithful fans. “ I’m happy for Tembo, he is our loyal servant and he deserves to be celebrated,” stressed Grobler. When asked what he would have done if he were in Thamsanqa Gabuza’s shoes, Grobler said he would not have played in the final. Gabuza lost his son on Monday and the burial took place on Thursday. But Gabuza only told his technical team and players after the game. “Everyone was shocked in the dressing room when he broke the news,” revealed Grobler. “I don’t know many people that can do what he did. I don’t think that I could do that. Massive credit should go to him. He has been through a tough time.”
