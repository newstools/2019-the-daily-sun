NOT a day has gone by when she hasn’t cried for her husband. Ntombi Masinga, late soccer player Phil “Chippa” Masinga’s widow. She cried uncontrollably again on Friday when North West Sport MEC Virginia Tlhapi handed her an award of recognition for Chippa.  Ntombi received the award at an awards ceremony in Klerksdorp, where different sporting codes were being acknowledged. CHIPPA WAS ALONE IN THE LAST DAYS OF HIS LIFE! Ntombi said: “It brings me joy to see the province still recognises him.” She said Chippa was her “safe place”. “With him around I could face anything,” she said. They had four children from previous relationships and shared a son. FAREWELL TO FOOTBALL WARRIOR CHIPPA She said: “I feel like a carpet has been pulled from under me and am still trying to find my feet. “I miss his sense of humour. I called him my encyclopedia because we talked about anything under the sun. He was well-informed about many issues.” Ntombi said the tears that guests saw during the ceremony were tears of joy. “Every time I hear his name mentioned, his image appears before me and I must cry. To have people appreciate him is very emotional,” she said. Chippa died in January. He had cancer.
