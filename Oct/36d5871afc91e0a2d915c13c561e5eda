In a Rugby World Cup semi-final the sooner forgotten the better, the Springboks booked their place in the final after edging Wales in Yokohama on Sunday. The Springboks won 19-16 after leading 9-6 at half-time. In a match blighted by aimless kicking and schoolboy errors, South Africa finally strung together enough passes to see centre Damian de Allende crash over for their only try of the match. Flyhalf Handre Pollard was on target with the conversion as well as four penalties.Wales replied with a try by wing Josh Adams as a result of a well-worked scrum move, while flyhalf Dan Biggar added three penalties. Fullback Leigh Halfpenny was on target with a conversion. The Springboks will play England in the final next Saturday in Yokohama (11:00 SA time), while Wales face the All Blacks in the battle for third place next Friday in Tokyo (11:00 SA time).Teams:Wales15 Leigh Halfpenny, 14 George North, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Hadleigh Parkes, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Dan Biggar, 9 Gareth Davies, 8 Ross Moriarty, 7 Justin Tipuric, 6 Aaron Wainwright, 5 Alun Wyn Jones, 4 Jake Ball, 3 Tomas Francis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Wyn JonesSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Dillon Lewis, 19 Adam Beard, 20 Aaron Shingler, 21 Tomos Williams, 22 Rhys Patchell, 23 Owen WatkinSouth Africa15 Willie le Roux, 14 S'bu Nkosi, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai MtawariraSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn SOURCE:Â SPORT24
