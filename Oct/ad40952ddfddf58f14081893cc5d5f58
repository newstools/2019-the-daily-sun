LITTLE Lihle is back home! The nine-month-old baby boy was kidnapped last Friday and was reunited with his mum Nancy Mmusi (29) on Wednesday. The mum of four from Protea South, Soweto said her baby’s kidnapping taught her not to trust anyone, even family members. Lihle was taken by a woman who apparently claimed to be a relative. Nancy said the woman took Lihle and his brother Masego (10). She said Lihle and Masego have different fathers and the woman said she was related to Masego’s father.  Nancy said she was not sure at first as she didn’t know the woman, but Masego said he knew her. “After a while, Masego came back alone with bread and cold drink. He said the woman sent him to give them to me. Masego went back but returned saying there was no one at the house. I started to panic,” said Nancy.  It turned out the woman was not a relative but lived in the same street as Masego’s father. Nancy said: “I immediately alerted the police because her phone was off.” Police launched a hunt for the woman. “It was a week of hell not knowing where my son was. I wondered what he was eating and if he had clothes. I could not eat, sleep or pay attention to anything or anyone. I was a dead woman walking,” she said. On Wednesday, Nancy received a call from the woman, who said she was in Brits, North West and would bring back her child. “She didn’t explain why she took him,’ said Nancy. Police spokesman Sergeant Khalipha Mvula confirmed that a 32-year-old woman was arrested and will appear in the Protea Magistrates Court on Friday. “The mother was contacted by the suspect and police tracked down the suspect in Brits. She was apprehended and faces charges of child stealing,” said Mvula.
