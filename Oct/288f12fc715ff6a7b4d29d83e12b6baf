THE ANC in KZN believes it will benefit from the problems facing the DA. While welcoming five disgruntled DA members to the party in Durban yesterday, provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said he believed people leaving the DA would choose the ANC over other parties. JUJU REACHES OUT TO MAIMANE! He said although the five didn’t join the ANC as a result of DA leader Mmusi Maimane’s resignation, he argued the ANC stood to benefit from the fallout.  The five former DA members include councillors Malika Singh and Rookshana Vally and former DA youth leader of KZN, Fikani Khubisa. Speaking on behalf of the five, Singh said they realised the ANC represented their political views more than any other party. DA leader in KZN Zwakele Mncwango, however, accused the ANC of being opportunistic. He said the ANC wanted the public to believe the five left the DA because of its current problems, which was not true.
