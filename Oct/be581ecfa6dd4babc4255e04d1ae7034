ATHLETICS SA has praised Precious Mashele and Glenrose Xaba for expanding on their impressive 2019 campaigns after they secured national titles on Saturday at the ASA 10km Championships in Middelburg, Mpumalanga. “Their performances have been consistent this year,” said ASA boss Aleck Skhosana. “Precious first pulled a surprise when he won the title last year. Glenrose is back with a bang after a bad start to the season.” Mashele successfully defended his crown, storming to victory for the Central Gauteng Athletics (CGA) team in 29:20. “It’s a wonderful feeling winning it two times in a row. It means a lot because of this, it can make a name for me overseas for invitations. From this, I’m praying that I’m selected for next year’s World 10km Championships in Holland. “My plan for the rest of the year is to run a fast 10km on 13 October in Durban, and 21km on 17 November in France,” said Mashele. In the women’s race, Xaba dominated the contest, taking the win for the Athletics Gauteng North (AGN) team in 33:33. “I’m very I won this crown because it was the only one I hadn’t won. I can now call myself a true champion after winning the national title in addition to all others in one year,”she said.
