HIS body was found by neighbours hanging from an electric cord. Taximan Lindile Xhalabile (35) from Bergman in Mangaung, Free State, killed himself after he was apparently dumped by his lover of several years. Neighbours said Lindile couldn’t live without the woman, who allegedly abused and cheated on him.  “He complained about his lover’s affairs. We always advised him to leave her,” said a colleague. Lindile’s cousin Seun said: “My cousin had a good heart and loved his baby mama with all his heart. “He seemed happy over the weekend and was with her on Sunday. “I learnt they broke up on Sunday night after he discovered an SMS on his baby mama’s phone. He took his own life after he was dumped.” A neighbour said: “He was with his baby mama on Sunday. I overheard them arguing about a man sending messages to her. “He and his girlfriend used to hang out together and Lindile loved her. He’d leave his friends to spend time with her.” Daily Sun tried to get hold of Lindile’s baby mama, who lives in Bultfontein, with no luck. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said an inquest dockets was opened. Investigations continue.
