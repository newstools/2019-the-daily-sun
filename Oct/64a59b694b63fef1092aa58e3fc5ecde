SPORT has a power to unite people in a way that little else does. Any Springbok event will be incomplete without these famous words by the late President Nelson Mandela. And it hasn’t been any different in recent weeks as the nation saw the Boks forge unity among South Africans with wonderful performances at the Rugby World Cup in Japan. Throngs of Boks supporters have been flooding to the “Boktown” in Montecasino in Fourways as seen when they watched the Boks edge Wales and advance to the final on a giant screen on Sunday. The electric atmosphere, created by the casino and Boks sponsors Castle Larger, virtually mirrored that in Japan and other Bok towns as fans rallied behind the team from thousands of kilometres away. Another massive turnout will most certainly be expected when Rassie Erasmus’s men take on England in repeat of the 2007 final on Saturday. “It was nerve-wrecking, but in the end it was an amazing,” said Castle Larger Brand Campaign manager Renier Olivier. “We are looking forward to the final next week. I definitely love the atmosphere. Sport definitely has the power to bring people together. To quote the late father of the nation, former President Nelson Mandela, sport has a power to unite a nation. Every time I come here I see the togetherness, people from all age groups celebrating being South Africans. “Before the final we want those registered for a free beer to go pick up their free beers and celebrate with the Springboks. “We are in a unique position as Castle to sponsor three national teams, including Bafana Bafana and the Proteas. It is no only about supporting the sports. But it’s also about unifying the nation, to grow and be better. We will keep doing more of this for all our national teams going forward, keep creating occasions for people to come watch sport like they’ve never done before. I’m already excited thinking about next year.”
