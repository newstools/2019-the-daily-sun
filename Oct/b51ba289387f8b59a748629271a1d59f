While the Fergusons might be at the top of Twitter's trend list following numerous allegations that their company Ferguson Films ills treats employees, Connie appears unbothered. Marah Louw, yesterday during Power FM 's Power talk at which she was invited to speak, said she had allegedly been blacklisted by the Fergusons following their public spat. She said: "I have been told by a few producers that they would love to work with me but they have been told that I am impossible to work with and complain about money." Connie, on the other posted a video on her Instagram account, in which she is practicing her 'victory' walk. Cava my victory walk!?? Every time I nail something, that’s my walk!????????‍?? . #happywackywednesday #strongerthanyesterday #evenstrongertomorrow #joyunderangelguard ???? . @sediimatsunyane ??
