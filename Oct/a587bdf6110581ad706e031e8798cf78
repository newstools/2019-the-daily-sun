JOMO COSMOS captain Ange Lebahi has warned his teammates to pull up their socks. Cosmos have not won a single match in the GladAfrica Championship this season. And that’s a serious concern if they are to challenge for promotion. They are in their fourth season in the GladAfrica Championship and it was only in the 2017/18 campaign when they came close to making a return to the Premier Soccer League, as they reached the promotion/relegation play-offs. Last season, Ezenkosi had the scare of their lives when they survived relegation to the ABC Motsepe League on the last day of the season. But it seems they have not learnt their lesson. They showed no signs of improvement. “Jobs are on the line,” said Lebahi. “As players, we need to fight and get results. If we continue this way, it’ll end up looking like we lack the drive and the club boss (Jomo Sono) will get other players to do the job.” Last season, Cosmos released most of the players, who were part of the team in the play-offs and started with new blood that struggled for the rest of the season. Currently, Ezenkosi are in 14th position with two defeats and three draws. Even at this early stage, you’d expect seasoned campaigners like Comos, Swallows FC and Free State Stars to be consistent performers and make their intentions well-known. But that has not been the case as they are all struggling with consistency. Lebahi vows things will change. “We’ve had a slow, disappointing start to the season. But it’s not about how we start. We will bounce back.” Today, Cosmos host Cape Umoya at their new home Giyani Stadium, where they are hoping for a turnaround. Today’s other fixtures (3.30pm): , Real Kings vs Swallows FC (Mpumalanga Stadium)., Jomo Cosmos vs Cape Umoya United (Giyani Stadium)., Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila vs Richards Bay (Thohoyandou Stadium).
