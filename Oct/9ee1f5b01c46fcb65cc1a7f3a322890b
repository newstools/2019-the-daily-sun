Mamelodi Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane has reignited his war-of-words with counterpart Ernst Middendorp while playing down the significance of their Absa Premiership clash against Kaizer Chiefs this Sunday. Speaking after a dramatic 1-0 win over Highlands Park - that sent Mosimane's men to second in the standings - Mosimane played down the match as a potential title decider. "We don't need to beat Kaizer Chiefs," Mosimane told SuperSport TV. "We don't need to beat Kaizer Chiefs to win the league, we have so many points to play for. Even if you lose against Chiefs or Pirates and you win the rest, you win the league. "We're not going to be emotional about the situation. Yes, we don't want to lose to them, yes our supporters don't want that, we want to win. But I'm not emotional about it, we have to be smart. "We know how to win the championship. We've won nine championships, we know how to win the league. This is about winning the league, it's not about fighting the guy who's on form. Mosimane went on to push a narrative that Chiefs are currently benefiting from refereeing errors before adding that he is eager to see Middendorp's reaction when Chiefs suffer a dip in form. "They are on form, they are doing well, they are strong, they are physical. Benni (McCarthy) was complaining after, you know the issues, the stories we speak about them. "It's a story with them, hopefully, things will turn around. I'm waiting for Middendorp to talk when things don't go well for him. I'm just waiting because I know his story, when he was at Maritzburg and everywhere else, he was facing the DC (Disciplinary Committee) every day, why? Because of fighting the referee, he forgets now. Now he's on a gravy train, his time is coming." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
