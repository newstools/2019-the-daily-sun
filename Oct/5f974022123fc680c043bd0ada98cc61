MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has paid tribute to his late “friend and brother” Thomas Madigage on the seventh anniversary of his death. Madigage, simply known as Tommy, died in a car crash in Limpopo in 2012. To this day, the former Bafana assistant coach is still remembered not only for his excellent football brain, but for having been a true gentleman of the game. Mosimane, who was very close with Madigage having met him when he was just 16-years-old and went on to work with him at SuperSport United, has nothing but fond memories with his late friend. Said Mosimane on Twitter: “Today marks 7 years since the tragic passing of my dear friend & brother, Thomas Madigage. Not only a good player, but a good person, something that is very scarce to find in football. He initiated my Coaching Career by bringing me to SuperSport FC"
