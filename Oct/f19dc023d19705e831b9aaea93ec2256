She said the man later asked if she could sleep with him for R20. “The landlady tried to convince me to agree because the man had promised her R100 in exchange for pimping me. “She said the man loved me and asked why I was acting as if I didn’t want it. I was angry and couldn’t believe a woman I trusted was pimping me to her tenant.” She told her mum and they opened a case. The shop owner was arrested on Saturday.
