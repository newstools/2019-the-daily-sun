Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy was not happy with some of the decisions that were made by the officials in their match against Kaizer Chiefs. The Citizens were dumped out of the Telkom Knockout by Amakhosi following a 4-2 defeat on penalties. Although he took the defeat on the chin, McCarthy could not help but express his disappointment with some of the referee’s decisions. McCarthy did not mince his words when he gave his opinion on the officiating, saying the referee was “diabolical.” “They say coaches when you lose you complain about the referee, but it was plain to see the referees today was diabolical, you know and players could’ve been injured long term with some challenges, there were certain instances where players could’ve been injured,” McCarthy told SuperSport TV. McCarthy, though, was pleased with the courage shown by his charges. However, he bemoaned their lack of killer instinct after they missed a number of chances and allowed Chiefs back into the game. “We played football. We opened their defence apart, one-on-one with the goalkeeper and we didn’t put the ball in the net. Kermit (chance) 2-0 up, I think Chiefs don’t come back," he added. “Overall, it was a great game of football. Today we showed what a great team we are, what a team we can be if we learn to bloody score more than one. You score one and then you’re happy instead of getting a second, a third or a fourth, and we come to shoot ourselves in the end."
