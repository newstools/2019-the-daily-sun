KAIZER Chiefs new signing Kearyn Baccus, the Australian midfielder
is already being compared to the Amakhosi icon Doctor “16V” Khumalo, just few
weeks into the new Absa Premiership season. The talented 28-year-old midfielder is currently wearing
jersey No6 but has indicated that he would like to wear the most famous jersey
No 15, which was made famous by “16 V” Khumalo. After Khumalo hung-up his boots, Chiefs’ chairman Kaizer
Motaung took the decision to retire the jersey. Khumalo broke his silence about the possibility of his famous jersey number
being given to another player. Although he admits that he is yet to meet the new kid on the
block in Naturena, Khumalo offered a free piece of advice regarding the magic
number. “Kearyn who? I’ve heard about the stories of him being
compared to me, but I have not seen the player playing. Believe it or not I
don’t know him, but I have a message for him about my No15 jersey.” “I saw the story about my jersey and that the player plays
like me. Bobby Motaung (Chiefs team manager), also told me what kind of a
player Kearyn is. He must ask relevant individual and ask them who is Doctor
Khumalo?” Khumalo insists that he did the same when he requested to
use No15 from Chiefs legend Jan “Malombo” Lechaba – the man who made the
jersey No15 famous. Khumalo said that if the player is as good as he was during
his heydays, he doesn’t see the reason why he shouldn’t be given his jersey. He said he will be in a much better position to judge Baccus
if he sees him play. Khumalo stressed the responsibility that comes with wearing
such jersey in the team. Khumalo said: “Yoh. He must know that what he is going to be
wearing is not a child’s play. That jersey is something that the Amakhosi
faithful loved to cherish. “He must know that he will be wearing a gold mine, that
jersey doesn’t come cheap. He is more than welcome to speak to me.”
