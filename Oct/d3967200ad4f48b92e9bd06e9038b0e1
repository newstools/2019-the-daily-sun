PETER Thabethe should have done his homework! This is the opinion that former Free State finance MEC Elzabe Rockman expressed during her testimony at the Zondo Commission yesterday. Rockman agreed with commission chairman, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, that any head of department should not appoint a company without knowing its finances. She said Thabethe, the former Free State agriculture head, should have conducted an investigation before appointing Gupta company Estina as a partner in the Vrede Diary Farm. The commission earlier heard Thabethe signed the multimillion-rand deal with Estina, despite it having a R16 balance in its bank account.  The project was aimed at benefiting emerging farmers in the Free State. “The provincial treasury did not play an oversight role on the project,” Rockman told the commission. She said financial risks would have been avoided had the project gone through proper tender processes and not through implementing agents. Rockman said the auditor-General had raised concerns about the use of implementing agents. READ: FROM CASHIER TO OWNER! Zondo said the impression he got was that implementing agents were used to avoid procurement procedures. Rockman said she thought the dairy farm project was still viable but needed to be run by people with the right skills and knowledge. New dates would be determined.
