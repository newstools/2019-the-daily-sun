KWESTA’S number one mlungu fan has been found! Josh Demaine (24) was recently captured on video singing along to Kwesta’s song Spirit. He told Daily Sun he’s s from Durban in KZN, but was currently in Sandton for training. He said he loved Kwesta and his music, and could sing along to his songs. But he didn’t expect the video of him singing along to Kwesta to be shared on social media or go viral when his colleagues recorded it. Asked if he’d like to meet the rapper, Josh said definitely yes.  “I always listen to his music, but I’ve never met him in person. Meeting him would be lovely,” he said. Daily Sun contacted Kwesta, whose real name is Senzo Vilakazi, to see if he was available for a meeting and he showed the same excitement as Josh.  But he said the meeting couldn’t happen yesterday or today as he was busy with a gig that was taking most of his time. He said he was available next week. “I’d love to meet Josh. We have to show the world that music brings happiness,” he said. The date for the meeting hasn’t been confirmed. But watch this space!
