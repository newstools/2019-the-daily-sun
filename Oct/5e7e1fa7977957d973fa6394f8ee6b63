ENTREPRENEUR Moshe Semenya is fluent in the language of business. The 34-year-old from Moshate, in Limpopo, said his experience came from having been hands-on at his dad’s business. The founder of Suits 2 Suit said doing business was his first love. Said Moshe: “My dad owned a clothing line called Skipper Bar.“This helped me a lot as far as learning about business at a young age. ”Moshe said he’d already learned about the ins and outs of the fashion industry by the time he was 10 years old.In 2014, he founded his business. Moshe said he saw a gap in the market.He said his company imports suits from overseas and sells them throughout Mzansi. The vibrant businessman said he was grateful for the support his venture has enjoyed. According to the businessman, he sells suits, socks, jeans, shirts, shoes and accessories. The businessman said he was so committed to his craft that he was just a phone call away and delivered his clothes nationwide. Said Moshe: “I make sure I create a good working relationship with my customers.“They’re great people who understand my hustle, which boosts my business confidence.”He told the People’s Paper he planned to turn his business into a franchise.
