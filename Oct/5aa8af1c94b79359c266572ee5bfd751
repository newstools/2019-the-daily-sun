SHE may be 82 years old but she’s still hoping for love – except her husband who died in 2011 keeps standing in her way! Gogo Bessie Mzibeli from Delft, Cape Town, lost her husband Aaron, when he was 82 and she’s beginning to think she will never find love again. “My love for him was irreplaceable,” she said. The gogo has tried to have boyfriends but whenever she thought about Aaron, she ended those relationships. “Aaron comes to me in my dreams,” she said. “I think I was meant to have only him in my life.” She said when she tries to have a relationship it feels as if he’s looking over her shoulder watching her. “I want companionship but I might not even get that.” The mum of three said her husband of over 50 years died without getting sick. They had visited family in Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape when he collapsed. He was rushed to hospital and died the next day. Gogo said young couples should learn to be as close as she was with her husband. “Then your marriage will last. “Nowadays people divorce easily because they’re after money and forget about love,” gogo said. Sangoma Ncumisa Mtunjwa from Kayamandi, Stellenbosch, said the gogo and her husband were soulmates. “Even in death their souls are still tied together. Gogo should be happy she is alive,” she said.
