CAPE Town City winger Surprise Ralani has admitted that he is yet to hit his best form in the Absa Premiership. The 32-year-old, who spent eight years in Europe playing in Sweden and Denmark for Helsingborg, IFK Hassleholm, Landskrona and LynLyngby Boldklubkby BK, is still trying to announce himself in Mzansi football. He has scored four goals and provided 10 assists in his 49 games for the Citizens since joining in January last year.Ralani is aware that he could have done much better and is determined to make a bigger impact going forward. He has targeted their next opponents, Maritzburg United, as he tries to show what he can do.The match will be played at the Cape Town Stadium on Friday (8 pm). “I haven’t been entirely happy with my contribution, there is definitely a lot of room for improvement,” admitted Ralani. “I have done my best, but I need to work harder to improve on certain things. I feel I haven’t shown exactly what I am capable of. “But it will come, I just need to continue working hard and doing the best that I can do every time I step on the field of play.” Ralani also believes the team as a whole needs to improve after a disappointing couple of weeks. Benni Mcarthy’s charges are yet to win a match since their opening day 1-0 victory over Stellenbosch FC. That is despite them being the highest-scoring team in the league with 13 goals. “That is the frustrating part. We are playing really well but we let ourselves down with small lapses in concentration as well as a couple of individual errors,” added Ralani. “If you watch our games, you will know that we work very hard for our goals but we fail to kill games off. We gift the opposition easy goals.”
