HIGHLANDS Park midfielder Mothobi Mvala has revealed that winning the MTN8 would be a bigger highlight for him than playing in the Olympic Games. Mvala was part of the SA Under-23 national team that played in the Rio Olympic Games in Brazil in 2016. His tournament was cut short though after he received a red card in the opening match against hosts Brazil at the Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brasilia. Mvala insists that although that was a big achievement for him, playing and winning Saturday’s Wafa Wafa final against SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium (6.pm) will eclipse it. “It’s a dream come true to play in the final,” said Mvala. “I have been here since 2013 and this is the first time being in the final. This is a special moment me and for us as a club. I’m happy that there is a possibility for me to play, I hope I will start. If we win, it’s going into the history book. It will also be the best moment in my life, even bigger than the Olympics for me.” Having broken his goal drought against Polokwane City over the weekend, Mvala will be hoping to be on the score sheet in the final. He scored eight goals in the league last season to lead Highlands to a top eight finish. And in their first crack at the Wafa Wafa competition, the Lions of the North have gone all the way to the final – their first ever in the PSL era. They are widely considered underdogs against Matsatsantsa, who will be looking to win the tournament for the second time in three years. “I was happy to finally break the ice, but I was not under pressure to score. Our strikers are doing the job, Peter Shalulile is on fire at the moment. It’s not about me," added Mvala. “With regards to us being underdogs, that doesn’t really bother us. We are not under pressure, we are going there as a united team determined to win the match. They will feel us.”
