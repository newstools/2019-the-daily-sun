Economic Development Agriculture and Environment MEC Dr. Kgosientso Ramokgopa has been replaced. The ANC's national executive committee, the highest decision making body between conferences, resolved that Gauteng premier David Makhura must remove a male MEC in line with a resolution taken at the end of May after he had appointed his cabinet. The ANC NEC made a decision that in provinces with male premiers, 60% of the executive had to be female. Makhura, however, had 50/50 representation.African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Ace Magashule last Wednesday said that the replacement will happen within a few days. Makhura had a choice between cutting Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku, Economic Development Agriculture and Environment MEC Kgosientso Ramokgopa, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Human Settlements, Urban Planning and Cogta MEC Lebogang Maile and Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo has been difficult for Gauteng. The axe fell on Ramokgopha. He was replaced by Morakane Mosupyoe as the new MEC for Economic Development Agriculture and Environment.Mosupyoe served as a counsillor in the City Of Tshwane from 2006 to 2016. During this period, she also served as the MMC for Health and Social Development. In 2011, she became the first female speaker of the City Of Tshwane.She is currently a member of the Gauteng ANC provincial executive Committee and serves on the provincial working committee. Makhura said: "I wish to thank Ramokhopa for the sterling work he has done over the past 4 months. I wish him well in his new role to be announced soon.Iâ€™m confident Masupyoe will build on the solid foundation laid by Ramokgopa towards the realization of our vision of growing the economy of our province. She will continue with the process of creating an integrated multi-tier special Economic Zones."
