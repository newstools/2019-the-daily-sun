IT SEEMS senior ANC leaders have distanced themselves from former president Jacob Zuma. When Zuma appeared for trial in the Pietermaritzburg High Court yesterday, very few ANC members came to support him. About 200 people were outside court, while KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu and former deputy speaker Meshack Radebe were the only top ANC members in court. Zuma was due to start his corruption trial, but his defence team said he was appealing the decision which dismissed his application to have his case struck off the roll. His 16 charges include fraud, money laundering and racketeering. His legal team included Daniel Mantsha, Thobani Masuku and Mpilo Sikhakhane, the son of Zuma’s old lawyer Muzi Sikhakhane. Judge Charmaine Bolton postponed the matter to 4 February. She said Zuma’s team will next month hear whether his appeal is granted or not. Bishop Vusi Dube said Zuma was sabotaged as his supporters’ transport was cancelled. He said 30 buses were supposed to come from Durban and Pietermaritzburg, but the owners told them they were told not to transport the people. ANC spokesman Ricardo Mthembu said the party would help find out who cancelled the buses but the party didn’t hire them.
