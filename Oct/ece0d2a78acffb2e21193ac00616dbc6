People couldn’t believe their eyes when a man pulled to a taxi rank and used a Mercedes Benz G63 as a taxi. In a video that’s gone viral on social media, the man can be seen opening doors for a couple of gogos at a taxi rank. One of the gogos can be heard in the background saying: “Hawu yiphupho leli” loosely translated as “This is a dream”. The gogo further says: “Now that I have been driven in this car, I will own it one day.” It is not clear when and where the video was taken.
