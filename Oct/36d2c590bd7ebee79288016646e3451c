ANGRY villagers have once again faced off with the police when they tried to attack a 35-years-old alleged killer and rapist as he was leaving the court. Chaos erupted outside the Nebo Magistrate Court near Jane Furse in Limpopo when a large number of police holding ballistic shields clashed with scores of villagers. The pushing began when the suspect who was being escorted by the police got at the court gate where a police Nyala was parked for transportation. The suspect was appearing for the alleged murder, rape and kidnapping of a 12-year-old schoolgirl Thandi Mampane who was found in a shallow grave last month. The Grade 5 pupil at Marishane Primary School was attacked on her way from school. Her body was found the following day after she was reported missing on the 6th September 2019.  The suspect abandoned his bail application to rather stay in custody. He will be appearing in the same Court again on the 9th December 2019 for further police investigations, also for the DNA results. The State has also added two more charges of another rape and robbery against him. Dickson Masemola MEC for Limpopo Transport and Community Safety Department who joined masses said he will continues to support and stand by the family and people as they seek justice. “I have seen that people are very angry. They have demonstrated their desperation for just to prevail. We are dealing with a very serious matter, as the state has added two more charges against the perpetrator.” Masemola said.
