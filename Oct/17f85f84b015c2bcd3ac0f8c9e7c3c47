We know that social media is filled with fake designer items either being sold or people flexing with them. Recently Social Media Influencer Mihlali Ndamase and Actress Buhle Samuels were accused of carrying fakes. Both the ladies posted pictures of themselves carrying their Chanel handbags and their followers suggested that they looked fake. Mihlali didn't take it lying down. The internet breaker then replied with receipts of herÂ R68 000 Chanel Bag and tagged the 'fan' that said her bag was fake.  Mihlali and Buhle are being called out for carrying fake designer bags??
