LADIES can now meet the man of their dreams thanks to the Boyfriend Stokvel. But don’t worry, if the description of the man of your dreams fits another woman’s ex, it’s OK to share. The stokvel’s administrator, Mamikie Mahlangu (36), told Daily Sun the group started two weeks ago. Two members have already met their potential boyfriends. She said she started the group as a result of past experiences.  “We’re trying to make sure this is not like any other dating site,” she said. “It will be safe. If anything happens to any of our members, we will involve cops,” she said.  Mamikie said all one needed to do was to tell them the kind of a man one wanted and the stokvel would do the rest. “If he fits the description, we make sure you meet. What happens after that is up to you,” she said.  One of the members, Angela Mokone (28), from Tshwane said: “I joined the stokvel last week and I’ve already had a date. We’re meeting again this weekend.” Another member, Thembi Ngobeni (30), from Benoni said she was now dating an ex-boyfriend of one of the members. Relationship expert Dr Eve said this sounded like a great idea, as long as it was safe.
