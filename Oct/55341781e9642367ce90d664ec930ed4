Today
is world mental health day. While
most people are suffering in silence, some take mental issues lightly. Dr
Ntokokozo Nkabide, who holds a diploma in medical technology and B tech in
pharmaceutical science and practises,  is living testimony that you can
overcome any obstacle in life. After
being diagnosed with Bipolar and mood disorder at the age of 19, Ntokozo made a
decision that this won’t be the end of her. Today she is a mother, motivational
speaker, doctor and wife just like any other normal person. Ntokozo, who
published her biography titled Bipolar&Me, is a living example that
mental illness can be managed if you opt for a healthier lifestyle. Ntokozo
attributed her success and normal lifestyle to her two children Lwazi and
Naala, her music executive hubby  and their family dog. Her
book, which is in stores, can help a lot of people who are dying in silence how
to redefine their lives. Ntokozo said she believes that you only have one life
to live. “Whatever
has happened to you does not define you,” she said.
