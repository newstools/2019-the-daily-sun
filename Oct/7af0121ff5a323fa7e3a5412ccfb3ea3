THE tickets sales for the annual Shell Ultra Helix Cup are going at a snail pace. With just four days to go before Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs and rivals Mamelodi Sundowns battle it out at FNB Stadium on Saturday (4pm), a mere 19 000 tickets were sold on Monday for the eagerly awaited match. SA Stadium management director Bertie Grobbelaar says the MTN8 Cup final between Highlands Park and SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium this past weekend could have contributed to the slow ticket sales of the annual competition. Said Grobbelaar: “Everything is in place planning wise. What we now need to do is have a look at the ticket sales to adapt our plan accordingly. We have planned on an attendance of 36 000 spectators and we hope to go to 50 000 as we did last year. Remember it was the MTN8 final this past weekend, so I believe the ticket sales will shoot through the roof this week. Traditionally there is a huge amount of uptake in the last week, for last year’s Helix Cup in the last week we sold 20 000 tickets, so I believe there will be a huge increase on sales." Meanwhile, JMPD spokesman Wayne Minaar says security will be tight in and around the stadium. “I think we have done good preparation from the safety point of view. The event will be policed thoroughly by the SAPS and JMPD. The traffic management plan is a well worked through plan that we have been using consistently for very big games such as this game. We will the Soweto highway closed from 11am until after the game just to make it safe for fans. We want to encourage fans to come early and park their cars because we will have ample free parking inside Nasrec Expo centre and Shareworld."
