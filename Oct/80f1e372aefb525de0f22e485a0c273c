THREE years ago, a woman came to see gobela Ngomamakhosi Mabaso and left her baby with her. And since then, the 56-year-old from Nquthu, KZN, has been searching for the boy’s mum. “I’ve been looking after him ever since his mum left him in my indumba. I hoped she would come back one day, but she never returned,” she said. “I even used my bones to try and search for her, but couldn’t find her.”  She said she loved the boy like her own but she wanted him to be reunited with his mum. “I don’t mind staying with the child, but I want him to know who his mum is. I can’t find peace not knowing what happened to her.” She said the woman told her she needed help with her ancestors. “I was going to cleanse her. She came with the baby, who was asleep, and I told her to put him on a grass mat. “She asked to go to the toilet and that was the last time I saw her,” she said.

Ngomamakhosi’s brother, Lindani (49), said some in the family didn’t like the idea of taking in a stranger’s child but his sister took good care of him. “The boy has grown now and we see him as part of our family. The mother should at least come and visit, just to see her son’s progress,” he said. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya said rituals needed to be performed for the child. “If it isn’t done, he might experience problems at a later stage. The mum needs to contact the gogo so they can fix things for the child before things get ugly.”
