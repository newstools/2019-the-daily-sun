Mzansi's most favorite DJ has opened up about having battled with low self esteem and many people can relate. The world renowned DJ whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo told Fresh onÂ 94.7 that his low self esteem was self sabotage. "I asked myself 'Why me? Why am I here?' It used to hit me and I would find myself not wanting to wake up, missing flights. It was self-sabotaging. (You feel like) it is such an unreal dream, it is going to end. Let me end it. I will feel better if I end it myself. Let me have something to blame, and it is me." he said. "My dream is to create a family out of this. Where we can call each other... I would like for us to become like, for example, me and Oskido, where when I have real problems, I call him. I would like to see that where we don't really know each other but can reach out to each other, to be a family." he said at a press conference of his 2019 Music is King concert launch.
