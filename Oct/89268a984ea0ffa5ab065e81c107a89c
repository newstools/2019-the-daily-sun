A video of a motorists being robbed in traffic has surfaced on social
media. In video number one shared by South African anti-crime activist Yusuf
Abramjee, a Nissan Qashqai can be seen stuck in traffic with the driver’s side
open. Out of the blue, a man wearing blue trousers and a t-shirt grabs what might be the motorists’ phone and disappears into a shopping complex. Following that, the motorist tries to chase him but is unable to catch
him.  In video number two, moments later the same man who grabbed the phone and ran – reappears and runs towards a Toyota quantum that was parked in front of the Qashqai. It appears the people in the Quantum, the tsotsi who stole the phone and another man were working together.
