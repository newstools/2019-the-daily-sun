BIDVEST Wits left-back Sifiso Hlanti is out of distress having overcome an injury that has kept him on the sidelines for months. Hlanti suffered a bad knee injury during Bafana Bafana’s 2-1 loss to Nigeria in the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) quater-finals in Egypt in June. However, that was not before he won the hearts of many South Africans superb performance. The Newcastle-born defender kept Mo Salah under constant watch, which frustrated the Liverpool star when Bafana shocked Egypt 1-0 in the round of 16. His knee injury led to the 29-year-old missing Wits’ first six matches in all competitions. His return match was an exciting 4-3 victory over Orlando Pirates at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on 29 September. “I’m excited to be back after such a long time,” Hlanti told SunSport. “It was bad two months for me nursing the injury, but I appreciate the team’s full support on my recovery.” The former AmaZulu defender missed two Fifa international breaks last month and one in October. But it didn’t matter much as the matches, against Zambia and Madagascar, were cancelled due to violent attacks on foreign nationals. He said he does not want to put himself under extreme pressure to reclaim his Bafana position. “In football you need to tell yourself that, ‘whatever comes, let it come’,” said Hlanti.
