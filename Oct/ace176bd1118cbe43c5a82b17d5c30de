NEWLY promoted Absa Premiership side Stellenbosch are here to stay. And those who think they will be relegated back to the GladAfrica Championship after one season in top flight will have eggs on their face at the end of season. The PSL newcomers finally registered their first win of the season when they beat Polokwane City 2-0 at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium midweek. “I told my players to take the criticism and build on it,” said Barker. “We know that come end of season, we’ll be the last to laugh. We have to believe in ourselves and pull ourselves out of this position. “It’s a massive feeling and relief to finally win a league game. We deserve this victory. We’ve been showing signs since the beginning of the season as we are improving after each week. “We knew that a win was not far. I’m proud of the team’s effort and our plan worked well.” The Stellies are currently third from bottom of the PSL, with seven points from eight league games. Barker admitted it has been a tough season as they battled to adapt to the PSL schedule. “This has been the hardest seven points in my coaching career,” said the former Pretoria University coach. “We’ve played six out of eight games away. We’ve been to Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, Joburg and Polokwane. “This week, we’ve been away from home for six days. But it’s good as we’re going back home smiling from ear to ear. We have to fight on. Hopefully, this break will help us to rest and recharge.” The Stellies’ goals against Rise and Shine were scored by Waseen Isaacs and Iqraam Rayners, who are expected to shine once more when they face Orlando Pirates at home in Cape Town on 26 October.
