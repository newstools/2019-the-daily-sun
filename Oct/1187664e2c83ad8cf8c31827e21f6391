AS the festive season is slowly approaching, the Minister of police Bheki Cele appealed to residents to work with cops. The minister made the appeal during the Safer festive season operations and MySAPS App launches which were held at King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi south of Durban today. Minister had started the day where he did walk abouts around Durban where met with residents and also introduced to them the MySAPS App. Speaking at the stadium Cele said residents must work together with cops during this festive season. He said residents are the ones who know who criminals are and where they stay. "These thugs are your boyfriends and husbands when they do wrong report them," he said. Cele also revealed that cops will be closing down illegal shebeens in all kasis around Durban. He said even the shebeens they have linceses should also close down if they keep children under the age of 18 years. "All those shebeens that are operating illegally will be closed down," said Cele. However Cele also appealed to residents to use the MySAPS App because it will be easy for them to report crime. A resident Ntombenhle Mchunu (24) said she will download the App as she believes it will assist in reporting crime.  "We were told that its safe and it has an option to remain unknown or if you dont mind revealing yourself its ok," she said. She said they were told that they can also report cops when they see them doing wrong things. Another resident Nhlanhla Mkhize (34) said he is pleased about the new App from police. "Now this is a good thing. Most people use technology and this is relevant," he said. He said he will also dowload the App.
