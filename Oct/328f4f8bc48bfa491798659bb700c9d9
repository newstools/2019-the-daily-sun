THE ANC in KZN has dismissed rumours that eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda will be removed before the end of the year. Zandile Gumede allegedly announced during one of her campaigns that she’d make changes in councils if she retained her position as regional chairwoman. READ: 'THE FERGUSONS ARE EXPLOITING ME' Speaking at a media briefing in Durban yesterday, the party’s KZN secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said mayors are appointed by provincial leaders. Ntuli said Kaunda and his new executive committee will run the city until the 2021 local government elections. Said Ntuli: “I can assure the leadership of eThekwini Municipality they’ll finish their term as agreed when they were appointed. “The ANC will support them to deliver services to people until 2021.” READ: NO MARRIAGE FOR BUTHELEZI! Gumede was removed as mayor in August and replaced with Kaunda, who was MEC for transport, community safety and liaison. She has been campaigning to retain her position as regional chairwoman when the conference sits in December. The party was expected to make a decision on the future of embattled Umvoti mayor Thami Ngubane but postponed it to today.  The mayor came under pressure from opposition parties recently after Daily Sun reported that he hired private bodyguards, which cost R11,8 million, without a risk assessment report. Meanwhile, NFP supporters marched to the municipality yesterday to demand the immediate withdrawal of the mayor’s bodyguards and other officials.
