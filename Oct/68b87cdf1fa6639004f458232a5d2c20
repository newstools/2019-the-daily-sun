Ncobo, a former no-nonsense referee is standing his ground that
Kaizer Chiefs’ opening goal against Mamelodi Sundowns last Sunday was
off-sides and says that SAFA are misinterpreting the off-sides law. Said Ncobo: “At all given times, those of us in the business
of making educated comments about referees decisions must always use language and
terminology that is consistent with the Laws of the Game. The Safa Review
Committee says that Leonardo Castro neither
played nor touched the ball from his team-mate, Reeve Frosler and this is
evidenced by the fact that the ball never changed direction nor the trajectory.” Added Ncobo: “This is inconsistent with the Laws of the Game
as there is no requirement for the ball to change direction, speed or spin. All
the Law says is whether or not the ball touched the player. If you look at the
incident in extra slow motion, Castro did touch the ball and it slid through
his hair. I am not creating my own rules. All I do is to present facts, not
opinions. If it was an opinion, I’d state very clear,” added Ncobo. After the tension-filled match, Safa review committee moved swiftly to release a statement explaining their stance and supporting their referee Victor Hlungwani. In many instances, the review committee has been accused by the soccer fraternity of stalling and taking too long to deliberate on cases. All eyes will now be on the committee whether they will react with such impressive speed when it comes to cases involving smaller category matches.
