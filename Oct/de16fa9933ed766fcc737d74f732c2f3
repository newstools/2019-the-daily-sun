Reality TV show Village Girls is back on our screens! This time around, it promises to be hotter and more entertaining. The Moja Love show, which is about Limpopo’s Phasha sisters, left people talking when they served Mzansi with the first season in April. It featured Arefa (34), Zozo (32), Dineo (30) and Honey (26), who effortlessly switched from drinking Black Label beer in the village to popping champagne and living the glamorous life in the city. The sisters said the new season will focus more on their business lives. They didn’t want to confirm the date for the new season. Arefa said people should look forward to lots of laughter, more tears and mixed emotions. “Viewers tend to think that we live glamourous lives every day, but there’s more to life than just that,” she told SunBuzz. “We want to bring them closer to our day-to-day business world. “When we fail we want to talk about the failures the same way that we talk about our victory. “We promise to bring out the best in the new season. “However, we don’t care about misconceptions other people have about us. “We just want to tell our story the way it is.” Zozo urged fans to be on lookout for her online channel Zonk TV, which will be launched soon.
