 Even if Halloween is not your thing, who doesn't love
a good scare? And according to science, evolution favours screamers. The theory goes that the genes of pre-historic humans
with a lesser ability to differentiate between screams relating to an
emergency, have all but died out, and we are "the descendants of
individuals who were good screamers." But, as this mom-to-be found, not all frights are made
equal. Curious about her baby's gender, Iyanna Carrington
from Virginia, US got much more than she bargained when her 24 week 3D scan
went from pleasant to spooky. One minute she was told everything was normal and the
next, a weird glitch turned her fetus into, well, a devil baby. "They showed her face and she looked normal. Then
the nurse confirmed she was girl, but I knew that deep down already. Then they
put it back on her face and she was just looking right at me like that,"
she told the Daily Mail. Although Halloween is often associated with
frightening costumes and scary pranks it can also be a fun time to do other
not-so-scary activities. Reassured by her doctors that the freaky image was
nothing out of the ordinary, Carrington said that both herself and the father
of her baby had a good laugh over everything. "We were just laughing at the scan. You can see
her little nose on [the other image]. You can tell she's beautiful
really." At least the mom now has a cool story to tell her baby
girl when she's all grown up. SOURCE: PARENT24
