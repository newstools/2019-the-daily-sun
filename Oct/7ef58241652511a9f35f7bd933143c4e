It was a bad day at the office for Mzansi star Percy Tau and his Belgian outfit, Club Brugge. They were walloped 5-0 by rampant Paris Saint-Germain in a Uefa Champions League clash at the Jan Breydel Stadium in Sint-Andries, Bruges on Tuesday. Kylian Mbappe scored a second half hat trick while Mauro Icardi also chipped in with a brace to down Brugge. In the process, Mbappe (20) became the youngest player to reach 15 or more goals in the Champions League, breaking Lionel Messi's record. Tau, though, was kept rather quiet for most of the match as he could not repeat is exploits against Real Madrid. The former Mamelodi Sundowns star, however, did play the whole game with Brugge looking to him and Senegalese star, Krepin Diatta, to create something for them. Brugge will turn their attention back to the Belgian Pro League on Sunday against second-placed Standard Liege. Their next Champions League match is against PSG at the Parc des Princes next month.
