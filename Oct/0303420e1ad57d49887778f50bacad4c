SANGOMA Mamohau Mohloki wants her relative to rot in jail. The relative (29) and her boyfriend (36) allegedly killed one of her patients!  The victim, Siphiwe Mtshali (32), was staying with Mamohau (57) and the relative in Botshabelo, Mangaung, when she died last Saturday. Siphiwe was featured in Daily Sun in 2017 after refusing to make vutha for her girlfriend to kill family members. The girlfriend then kicked her out. Mamohau said Siphiwe protected her relative from her evil man, but her relative ended up helping him to kill Siphiwe. “Siphiwe came to me to get help with spiritual troubles. My relative’s boyfriend was abusive and Siphiwe started to protect her from him. “It seems my relative was made to hate Siphiwe by her boyfriend and they drugged and killed her. “I want them to rot in jail. I went to the holding cells and cut my relative’s sangoma beads off her wrists and ankles and threw them where no one would find them. “What hurt me was that I heard my relative shouting from the back of the police van that she killed Siphiwe. She killed someone who really loved and protected her.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed the case. “On 19 October police arrived at C1 section in Botshabelo. The victim was found strangled with a rope inside the house. “Suspects aged 29 and 36 were arrested. They appeared in court and their case was postponed.”
