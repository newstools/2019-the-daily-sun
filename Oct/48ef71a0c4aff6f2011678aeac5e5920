Jordaan, together with the South Africa Football Association, have wished the SA national rugby team good luck ahead of their 2019 Rugby World Cup final against favourites England at the Yokohama International Stadium on Saturday. Jordaan, was speaking at the Safa national executive extraordinary meeting on at SAFA House on Thursday. “Best of luck to the Springboks. This is the replica of 2007 in Paris when South Africa lifted the trophy. I was there in Paris and I remember that last minute try from England on the corner. The try was disallowed and the Springboks went on to win the cup,” said Jordaan. “We are keeping our fingers crossed that captain Siya Kolisi, Rassie Erasmus and the rest of the players will win the World Cup in Japan," Jordaan added.
