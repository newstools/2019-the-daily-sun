“LET’S pray that teams don’t benefit from poor officiating. ”This is a call for divine intervention from Pitso Mosimane as he calls on the referees to stop “benefiting” teams through questionable and favourable decisions. PSL match officials have come under fire from local coaches this season due to poor officiating. The Mamelodi Sundowns coach, though, has been the most vocal, and on Sunday took his criticism a notch up, following their 2-0 league loss to Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus. Mosimane argued that Chiefs’ opening goal shouldn’t have stood as Samir Nukorvic was offside. Asked if it was time the PSL introduced visual assistant referee (VAR), Mosimane said: “First, we need the spray (vanishing spray to provide a temporary visual marker). Second, goal-line technology. Third is communication. There was no communication when we played against AmaZulu. “Then we can go to VAR. Let’s crawl first before we can walk. The fourth one is prayer. We need lots of praying when we play these teams that they don’t benefit again. There are many factors. ”Mosimane, however, gave credit where it was due, particularly with the bookings for foul play. “In terms of the fouls, Victor (Hlungwani) was good. Kekana deserved a card, Willard Katsande and Khama (Billiat), too. We have to note the positive also.”
