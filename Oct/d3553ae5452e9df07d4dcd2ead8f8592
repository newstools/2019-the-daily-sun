THUGS who broke into the school must be taught a lesson they’ll never forget! This is what Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi wants. He urged residents to come forward and tell him who broke into Esithebeni Primary School in Zola, Soweto, on Friday night. Education spokesman Steve Mabona said tablets, laptops, computers, smart boards and sound equipment were taken. The stolen equipment is worth more than R3 million! Lesufi called this an attack on education. “Criminals must not be allowed to postpone the future of our children! The community must tell us who stole our equipment!” he tweeted. On Saturday Lesufi, along with the police and Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, went to the school to inspect the damage. “We’re devastated and emotionally drained,” he said. Police spokesman Sergeant Khalipha Mvula said no arrests have been made and a case of theft was being investigated. Angry residents said thugs were crippling schools.
