In the 22-second clip, which Daily Sun has heard, a person is heard calling on people to attack non-residents going to work.  a voice is heard saying. In a media briefing, mayor Vincent Chili said police had been asked to arrest Ngcobo for inciting violence.  Chili said the municipality was fed up with Ngcobo for organising protests for political gain. Ngcobo is the leader of the African Freedom Revolution. Ngcobo told Daily Sun he was aware of moves to arrest him. He urged people to continue with the protest, even if he was arrested. He denied he encouraged violence against those going to work, adding the shutdown would be peaceful. “We don’t want war, but water. They want to arrest us instead of addressing our problems,” said Ngcobo. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said police were aware of clips circulating on social media.
