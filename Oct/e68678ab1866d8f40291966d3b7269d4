 IT’S one thing
having all the money in the world to buy fast cars, but skill can’t be bought. The Mercedes-AMG
C63 S is a beast, and as an unskilled driver you shouldn’t fool around with it. It’s twin-turbo
4.0-liter engine provides well over 503 horsepower, now pairing it with an unskilled driver
is a recipe for disaster. A video of
a man crashing the Merc beast has surfaced on social media. In the
video by CarSpotterQVS, the man can be seen behind the wheel of a Mercedes-AMG
C63 S Sedan attempting to excite the crowds while leaving a car show held at
the Rotterdam Ahoy. As the
driver was trying to do donuts, while the exhaust made crackles and pops – he lost
control and hit a pavement. As though
that wasn’t enough, it went through and crashed into a tree.
