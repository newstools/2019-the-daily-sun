AFTER his four-goal haul, Serge Gnabry says Bayern Munich's 7-2 gala romp at Tottenham Hotspur sent a "big message" to their Champions League rivals. Gnabry dazzled at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday as Bayern handed their hosts the highest-ever home defeat suffered by an English team in European competition. The former Arsenal winger netted his four goals in a devastating second-half spell while Poland striker Robert Lewandowski also scored twice as Spurs' defence capitulated. "I think (the other teams know) we are not stopping," Gnabry told reporters after his first Champions League goals in his 12th appearance at this level. "After going 3-1 or 4-2 up we could have stopped but we wanted more. "I think it's a big message for everyone else." Germany legend and Sky pundit Lothar Matthaeus agreed that Bayern "set an example to their international competition as far as the Champions League title is concerned. "I don't want to say that they are title candidates, but this result will give them self-confidence," he added. Gnabry is no stranger to claiming goals in high-score wins after a hat-trick on his Germany debut three years ago in an 8-0 romp at minnows San Marino in a 2018 World Cup qualifier. However, the 24-year-old admits his four goals is something special. 'Hard to put into words'"It's hard to put it in words. I think the last time I scored four goals was when I was a child," he laughed. "I'm very happy with my performance of course and glad I could help the team to such a big win," he said.
