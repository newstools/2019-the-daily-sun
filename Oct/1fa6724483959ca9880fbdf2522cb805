Kaizer Chiefs legend Doctor “16 V” Khumalo has tipped his former team to win the Absa Premiership title ahead of back-to-back champions Mamelodi Sundowns. The former Bafana Bafana star believes this is Amakhosi’s year to finally get their hands on the championship trophy. The famous ex-footballer is convinced that the glory days are coming back to Naturena. Amakhosi visit the defending league champions at Loftus Versfeld in Tshwane on Sunday (3.30pm). Two weeks ago, the Glamour Boys defeated Downs 4-2 in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup match played at the FNB Stadium. But this match will be seen as Amakhosi’s biggest test in their quest to win the league title. A confident Khumalo said: “The glory days are coming back. This is the year to win trophies for Chiefs. The players are hungry and there is stability in the team. Chiefs will go on to win the league.” Khumalo is impressed with the way Amakhosi are playing and says it’s not by coincident that they’re leading the pack in the Premiership with 19 points from eight games. Things are also looking good for the Soweto giants as they progressed to the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal after they defeated Cape Town City on penalties on Saturday. Khumalo is not scared of any team this season and he believes that Amakhosi are well on their way to reclaim their glory days. Added Khumalo: “They are not conceding too many goals and they score as well. They are playing as a team and there is discipline in the team.”
