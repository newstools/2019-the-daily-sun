ONE moment Max Nhlapo (31) was sewing clothes in front of his clients. The next the tailor was writhing in pain after cops allegedly stormed his mum’s house in Orlando East, Soweto, on Friday 26 September and started beating him. Max died three days later. His distraught mum, Mabel (35), said her son was repeatedly beaten with the back of a gun in the head and chest. She said Max was in the backroom of her property with clients while his brother Nhlakanipho and his friends were smoking. She said a group of cops then burst into her yard and started beating her two sons. “I was in the house when I heard one of the boys call my name. I saw cops had invaded my property,” she said. Mabel said the cops told her to go back in the house and continued beating her sons. Nhlakanipho told the People’s Paper: “I asked the cops to at least search Max if they thought he had anything illegal on him, but they just kept on beating him.” Mabel said Max vomited blood on Sunday morning. Mabel told Daily Sun all she wanted was for the cops to stay away from her home as this was not the first time such beatings happened. Captain Nomvula Mbense said an inquest docket was opened. He said a 31-year-old male died on Monday after vomiting blood and complaining of chest pains.
