HE’S only five but Pipi Liyasha Nsibande is making waves in the maskandi world. The grade R pupil from KwaHlabisa, northern KZN, had his big break in March when he performed at the Gcwalisa iMabhida Maskandi Festival at Moses Mabhida Stadium, Durban. In July, he performed at the Impucuzeko Maskandi Festival. But his stage name is a cause of concern for his parents. His dad Mkhathazi, who’s also a maskandi artist, said: “It was given to him by his peers but over the years, it has stuck.  “They called him Pipi Liyasha, which means hot 4-5, because he wanted to walk around naked and refused to wear trousers.  The boy told the SunTeam: “My name is Pipi Liyasha, King Wabantwana. I also have two other names, Enhle and Bayanda, but I like Pipi Liyasha more. Even on stage, I perform naked because I don’t like wearing ibheshu or clothes. Sometimes I wear nappies but they’re uncomfortable.” He said he wanted to become a cop. His mum Thulebona said she’s worried her son’s stage name might lead to inappropriate behaviour later in life. “I wouldn’t want him to grow up thinking he’s hot and I hope he changes this name later.”  The boy has already worked with famous producers.
