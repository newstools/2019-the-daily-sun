YOUNG people should learn to be strong. Maskandi legend Ihhashi Elimhlophe, whose real name is Bheki Ngcobo, said his generation grew up the hard way. “But we never gave up. Today’s young people give up easily, even committing suicide if things don’t go their way. They get to 25 and describe life as a failure.” Ihhashi told Daily Sun had he been a quitter, he wouldn’t have survived in the industry. “I started music in 1975 and my first album didn’t do well but I kept going.” In 1976 he released his second album and it did very well. “I never looked back. I’m still going strong,” he said. He’s just released his 29th album, Ama Waza Waza. Ihhashi has four kids and has been married to musician Linah Ngcobo for more than 40 years. They’ve helped their kids to also build careers in music. He said he never thought of getting more wives. “My father had eight wives. My mother had 10 children. We got limited attention from our dad.” He said he loved his small family and would do anything for them. He said maskandi was in his veins. “I keep it simple so young people like it. I collaborate with people from other genres. I want to make maskandi fun. It should move with the times.” He revealed that he did not finish school. At a very young age he looked for a job on a farm and was paid R2,50 a month. “My mother was struggling so I sent R2 for them to buy food and kept 50 cents for myself,” he said. He got a job in construction which paid R5 and grew to R7,50. “I bought my first guitar.” He said nothing would separate him from music.
