POLICE in Kagiso in Mogale City have joined forces with the Department of Community Safety and other partners to create awareness about gender-based violence. They visited Madala Hostel on Saturday following the recent spate of killings, including the murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana. According to a Stats SA report on crime against women, the killing of women in Mzansi is five times higher than the global average. Cops spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya told Daily Sun women don’t report abuse or withdraw charges. “Women don’t report abuse,” said Sibiya. “We took it upon ourselves to engage and educate them about their human rights and responsibilities. “In most instances, we focus on township residents and forget about hostel inmates.” A hostel resident said she almost got out of her marriage in a coffin. “I made excuses for him for seven years. He’d beat me up and drag me outside and apologise afterwards. “I decided to report him when he started abusing me sexually. “I just couldn’t take it. I’m just glad he’s now behind bars and not bothering anyone.” Another woman said she was even forced to move to another place. “He abused me physically and emotionally,” she said. “Whenever I reported him to my elders, they’d tell me to pray about it. “I knew there and then I needed to take charge.”
