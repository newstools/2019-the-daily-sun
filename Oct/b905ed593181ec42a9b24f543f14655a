It will take a mere two minutes for Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt to know what his club’s Caf Confederation Cup opponents, are all about. The temperamental Clever Boys coach admitted that UD Songo are a closed chapter ahead of their preliminary first-leg meeting in Mozambique on Sunday afternoon (3pm). The hard-to-please Cape Town born mentor does not stop complaining, if he is not complaining about this, he is complaining about that. The Clever Boys will not be involved in the Absa Premiership this week due to their involvement in Africa and by the time they return to the domestic scene, Hunt and his boys will have three games in hand. Hunt is already worried about January as games will be coming in thick and fast for his boys. Said Hunt: “We have to play nine games in January. That’s a crazy schedule I don’t think that we can handle that.” Hunt says that he will beef up his squad in the January transfer window. “I have to reinforce the squad. We will bring in a couple of new players so that we can cope with the workload.” Hunt said that he is taking only 18 players to Mozambique for the Confed Cup match. The Clever Boys leave the country on Saturday morning. Added Hunt: “We are not like Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates or Mamelodi Sundowns. We don’t have a big budget to travel a couple of days before kick-off. I also don’t know much about the opponents but need just two minutes to figure them out. “ On falling back behind in the league due to African commitment, Hunt said there is nothing much he can do about it. “What can I do. I just have to play the catch-up games when the times comes.”
