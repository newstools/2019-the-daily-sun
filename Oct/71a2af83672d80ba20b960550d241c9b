NELSON Mandela Bay has been ranked the worst-performing metro in terms of collecting rates and taxes and spending. Leander Kruger of the DA, the metro’s main opposition party, said according to statistics released by national Treasury earlier this month, the metro only collected 85% of budgeted revenue and only spent 83,2%. “The sad state of affairs is compounded by repeated warnings from national Treasury that no roll-over of grant funding to the metro will be approved unless there is a permanently appointed chief financial officer. “As a result, the metro stands to lose about R500 million in roll-over grant funding. Instead of calling a council meeting to appoint a chief financial officer, the Speaker of council placed the council in recess for a five-week period,” said Kruger. He said the current coalition government, made up of the UDM, ANC, African Independent Congress, United Democratic Fund and EFF, was unable to collect money or properly spend it. He said while the DA-led coalition was governing the metro, the financial situation looked better. “The city is dirty. Illegal dumping is on the rise. Refuse collection is not regular. Our parks are not being cleaned,” he said. Mayoral spokesman George Galeba said the DA was working day and night to prevent the coalition from doing its job. “They are at the centre of all they accuse us of doing, as they do not play their critical part in attending council,” he said. Galeba said a chief financial officer couldn’t be appointed because members of the DA refused to attend meetings. – CITY PRESS
