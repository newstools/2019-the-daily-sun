Cheating has become so popular that some women see it necessary to get their husbands or boyfriends chastity cages. This drastic measure is making a major comeback as some of the women want their men to keep their junks in their pants. Originally, chastity cages were designed for kinky purposes in BDSM to avoid theÂ wearer of the belt from physically touching their genitals and to usually prevent masturbation.  These cages come with locks and key holders for safe keeping. Elitereaders reports that one of the wearers of the cage actually loved it because he had no control of the key so it helped him with his sexual urges. The cages also prevent husbands and boyfriends from wasting their sexual pleasures and libido in masturbation.
