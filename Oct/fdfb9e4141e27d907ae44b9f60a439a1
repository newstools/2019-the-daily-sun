GROWING up, gospel music legend Dr Rebecca Malope’s family was hit hard by poverty. The gospel star shared shocking details of what they went through as a family. “We were so poor that we had to eat rats in order to survive,” said the music star. Talking exclusively to Daily Sun, Malope said living in poverty was an understatement because her upbringing was 10 times as bad. She told Daily Sun that all the details about her upbringing will be outlined in her new book which she is busy writing and yet to be named. “What people can expect from the book will tear their hearts into pieces. “This is the story of my life. “Yes, I was hungry and we ate rats and at that time I was around 8-years-old. “A lot happened in my upbringing and the book will sort to motivate those who are going through similar challenges.  "The book will help other people heal from their past and their current life challenges which I have gone through," she said.  Malope said the upcoming book will be accompanied by a musical stage play performance named Angingedwa, which will be visualising the book itself.  Malope said the book will also reflects on her family life while growing up in KaNyamazane outside Nelspruit.  She expects people to be shocked but mostly some to be motivated after learning about the details of her upbringing.  Malope added that concentrating on the book and the play does not mean she is now neglecting her music career.  According to the legendary singer, she will continue releasing singles digitally. The gospel star says CDs are slowly fading away because technology is taking over.  She also said that she will continue doing live performances. "I love gospel, I love worshiping God and I love telling the good news of God," she said
