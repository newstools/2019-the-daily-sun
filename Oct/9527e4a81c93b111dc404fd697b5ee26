SUNSPORT has reliably learnt that former Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba is back. According to insiders, the 69-year-old has been appointed coach of Gauteng ABC Motsepe League side Blue Lions. “Shakes Mashaba has joined a Motsepe League side called Blue Lions,” claimed SunSport’s source. When SunSport called Mashaba for a comment, the legendary coach was evasive. “Let me finish what I’m busy with and then I’ll let you know where I stand,” said Mashaba. He added: “But I’m yet to be appointed as the club’s coach. But where did you hear it? I’m in the meeting. Can you call me maybe tomorrow morning (today), because I can’t talk about something I’m not sure of.” Mashaba’s last coaching job was with Witbank Spurs in the GladAfrica Championship (National First Division) last season but he was sacked in April due to the string of poor results just four months into the job. Despite his sacking, the club was relegated to the Motsepe League in Mpumalanga. Mashaba led Bafana to the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea but the national team failed to get out of the group stages.
