The star took to social media to share the exciting news, "You have made one of my bucket list dreams a reality. Not only am I a Graduate but I’m also a Golden Keys Member *two snaps* hey" she wrote in part. What a beautiful miracle and joyride this little life of mine is. When I was asked who I would like to have in attendance to receive my award on my behalf. I said my mother, who’s womb was my first home. I said my baby brother, because my deepest desire is for life to be kind to him and grant him his wildest dreams. And my niece, because she’s my heart and I want her to see herself on that (or any other) stage one day. . Thank you so much to the University of KwaZulu Natal and the Golden Keys International Society for this incredible honour. You have made one of my bucket list dreams a reality. Not only am I a Graduate but I’m also a Golden Keys Member *two snaps* hey ???? . When I arrived at university all I ever wanted was to make it into the Golden Keys Society (and Deans list) for excellent academic achievement, but as you know my life has been unconventional in the way that God has chosen to orchestrate it. Fast forward to 2019 and I am made an Honorary Member alongside other incredible pioneers and extraordinary South Africans. What a true blessing. Ngiyabonga. A post shared by  Nomzamo Mbatha ????
