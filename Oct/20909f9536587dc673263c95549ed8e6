Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Oupa Manyisa revealed that he underwent surgery on his Achilles tendon and hopes to make a speedy recovery. He said on Twitter: "Thanks for all the well wishes. I'm doing well after surgery & looking forward to being back on my feet. We must keep our Faith even in the tough times so that we can grow stronger ..." The 31-year-old picked up the knock against Kaizer Chiefs in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup and is expected to be sidelined for the rest of the season. Meanwhile, the Brazilians are yet again taking on rivals Amakhosi on Sunday, October 27 in an Absa Premiership at Loftus Versfeld. A victory for the Tshwane giants would put them in pole position while boasting a match in hand as well. Amakhosi have started the league campaign in sterling fashion heading the Absa Premiership table with 19-points after eight matches. The Brazilians are looking to regain the title despite having so much on their season itinerary with the CAF Champions League. Pitso Mosimane will hope to keep up with Chiefs while also chasing a second star in four seasons. Sunday's match starts at 15:30.  SOURCE:Â SPORT24
