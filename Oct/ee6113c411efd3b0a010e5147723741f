TEACHING and learning were disrupted at Bechet High School yesterday. This came after several grade 8 and 9 pupils started screaming and fainting at a health and care programme in the hall at the school in Sydenham, Durban. PICS: PASTOR SERVES PIG SKOP AS HOLY COMMUNION! A pupil (14) said a pupil who had visions stood up and said something bad was about to happen. “The programme continued. That was when pupils started screaming and fainting,” said the pupil. A grade 11 pupil (17) said they were not happy with how teachers handled the matter. “Teachers should have listened to the pupil and called everything off. The sad part is that the teachers who ignored the spiritual vision are black people who should know this thing is real.” PUNANI DRUG SMUGGLER'S SON RETURNED TO MZANSI A parent (44), who was at the school to deal with another issue, said the school needed prayers. “Maybe it will help. I don’t know what I saw earlier but it was very scary and something must be done to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” said the parent. The principal, who refused to give his name, wouldn’t comment. “You know I am not allowed to talk to the media. I’ve forwarded a report to the district office. Contact the department for comment,” said the principal. BUST FOR BURYING SON IN SHALLOW GRAVE! Department spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said incidents like this were a social issue. “Because teachers are only trained to teach, we rely on organisations like churches to intervene.”
