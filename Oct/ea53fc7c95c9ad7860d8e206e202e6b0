“CHIEFS is not our big game, but Highlands Park is our big game.” So says Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane as he cranks up the mind games ahead of their blockbuster match with Kaizer Chiefs at Loftus on Sunday. Mosimane has chosen to downplay the anticipated weekend clash and focus on the home fixture against Highlands at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (7.30pm). But those who have followed the “Helix Ultra Cup” war of words between Mosimane and his Chiefs counterpart, Ernst Middendorp, would concur tension is bubbling under. “We must win the Highlands Park game because that’s our big game and we don’t have to beat Chiefs to win the league,” said Mosimane. “The Highlands game is a big game for us. Both games have three points if you win them. But if you start focusing on the Chiefs game, you are being emotional. “Chiefs is not our big game, but the Highlands is. After the Highlands game‚ my talk will probably change. But at the moment, it is Highlands Park.” Mosimane has often shown the utmost respect for Highlands, explaining they are a formidable side. Even though they routed AmaZulu 5-0 in the cup, Sundowns return to league action cautious not to drop further below Amakhosi on the log. “We played them at home last season and never won. So we need to get the three points from Highlands and you are not going to get it easy,” Mosimane explained. “You know ODG (Owen Da Gama) has his team tight. Nobody scores easy against them. They are hard runners and they have a few players who played for us and they want to do well against us.” Despite the excitement that is building up towards the big showdown at Loftus, Mosimane has re-emphasised his priorities. He said: “I have told the boys after the match that I hope nobody talks about Chiefs. I told you last year that we don’t have to beat Chiefs to win the league. “Beating Chiefs is about bragging rights and it is a game that everybody is waiting for.”
