A FACELESS body was found at South Park Cemetery in Mangaung, Free State. The dead man is believed to be aged between 25 and 30 years old. A passerby on his way to visit his mum’s grave on Sunday noticed the body lying in a pool of blood next to a grave.  He couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw the body. The witness said: “I saw there was only a skull left. It looks as if the person’s face had been skinned. “I think he was killed there. People are so cruel. How can you skin a person like that?” He then called the police. “I didn’t even go to my mother’s grave. I just went straight home because I was in shock.” Mampho Ramakala (46) said: “I was visiting my husband’s grave when I saw the police. I’m afraid to come to the graveyard alone. “Thugs don’t respect the dead. Maybe he was killed while visiting a grave.” Sergeant Fikiswa Matoti said: “The whole face of the deceased was removed, including the skull. Police are investigating if the person was murdered at the cemetery or killed elsewhere and dumped there. “He wore black jeans, a black T-shirt, black Vans takkies and a red cap.” Kagisanong police are investigating a murder case. “No one has been bust,” Matoti said. “Police are calling on people to help.” Matoti asked anyone with information to call Warrant Officer Tefo Lefalatsa at 082 465 5945.
