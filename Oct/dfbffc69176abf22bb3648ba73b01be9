BY the end of this weekend, Kaizer Chiefs could be double champions! The Shell Helix Ultra Cup and the Macufe Cup are up for grabs for the Naturena side who have been at the peak of their form this season, under head coach Ernst Middendorp. On their back-to-back fixtures on Saturday and Sunday, Amakhosi will face Mamelodi Sundowns at FNB Stadium (4pm) in the Shell Cup and complete their weekend of fun in Bloemfontein against Bloem Celtic in the annual Macufe Cup on Sunday at 3pm. It is another opportunity for Middendorp to test his dressing room whether it has quality or quantity. They started the 2020 PSL season on a sprint like Usain Bolt on track, winning six of their Absa Premiership matches lifting them top of the table. Through the club’s website, midfielder Willard Katsande said this weekend’s matches will help them maintain their shape. He added they are not going to take Macufe and Shell Cup for granted. “We don’t want to lose our momentum,” the 33-year-old is quoted.“ "We going to approach it in a competitive way and give the fans something to shout about. Consistency will be key for us to achieve what we want. ”The player also insisted that this will give fringe players an opportunity to get minutes: “The season is very long and we need everyone."
