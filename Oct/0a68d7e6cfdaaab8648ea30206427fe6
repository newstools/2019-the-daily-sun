SOCIAL media was on fire with news of Lerato Makgatho’s alleged affairs involving government ministers. She allegedly was romantically involved with both Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe, as reported in Sunday World. She described Mantashe as a tiger in bed and said Mboweni switched off the lights when it was poking time. The 26-year-old from Winterveld, Tshwane, was a SunBabe of the week in 2017. In 2012, she became Miss Winterveld, Miss Mabopane and Miss Lovely Legs. She appeared in small roles in popular soapies like Extra, Generations, Rhythm City and Isidingo. She also appeared in Mokapelo,Shift, Big Ups and Mzansi Magic reality show, Please Step In (she had taken her mum to the show with the hopes of mending their broken relationship). Last year, she confronted her friend on Rea Tsotella after allegedly catching her in bed with her man. On Uyang’thanda Na, she famously told a man he couldn’t afford her lifestyle. Daily Sun tried to get hold of Lerato several times with no success. Meanwhile, the South African National Editors’ Forum was shocked to hear of Mantashe’s brazen alleged admission that he paid two Sunday World journalists to bury the story about his relationship with Lerato. Mantashe claimed he paid the journalists R70 000 to destroy evidence backing the story. Sunday World editor Makhudu Sefara said the paper took Mantashe's claims very seriously and that it was a pity that he had not disclosed the names of the journalists. It encouraged him to approach Sanef, as it was holding an Inquiry into Media Credibility and Ethics. Sanef said it would support the newspaper's investigation into the matter and its commitment to ensure all its journalists signed pledges to ensure ethical journalism. It would also add a specific clause to its "draft rules of engagement" with political parties to call for politicians to support an outright ban on any form of brown envelope journalism.
