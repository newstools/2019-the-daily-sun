MATRIC exams in KZN kicked off with tight security. This after the controversial business forum Delangokubona threatened to disrupt the first paper yesterday. During his visit to Adams College in the south of Durban yesterday, Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said he and Transport and Safety MEC Bheki Ntuli had to put extra security measures to ensure the start of the exams ran smoothly after the threats. He said the forum sent messages to department head Enock Nzama, demanding an urgent meeting with him to know who’d deliver exam papers to schools as they weren’t consulted or asked to do the job. Mshengu said after they were ignored, the forum sent him a message telling him they’d burn the trucks delivering papers to schools. “We told them we wouldn’t be stopped by anyone in our work to ensure pupils write their exams freely. We’re ready for anyone who’ll dare disrupt exams in the province,” said Mshengu. He said although those who were sending messages didn’t give their names, they just wrote they were Delangokubona. Mshengu said he was happy to hear the forum’s leadership distanced themselves from these threats. The forum’s president, Bhamuza Mnyandu, said they never wanted the tender to deliver exam papers, so he didn’t know who made the threats. Mshengu said all law enforcement agencies were activated in all 12 districts in the province.
