SOUTH African Post Office acting CEO Lindiwe Kwele told Parliament yesterday her organisation was working on distributing grant money from spaza shops. Briefing MPs on the post office’s financial report for the last financial year, she said she believed spaza shops could be empowered by allowing them to pay grant beneficiaries. Kwele said one of the biggest challenges the post office faced was paying for security when transporting money to rural areas. “The cause of our increasing expenditure is the issue of cash-in-transit and security at pay points in rural areas,” she said. Kwele said the post office’s agreement with Sassa was that 900 000 people in rural areas needed payment services, but only 200 000 were being paid. She said in some areas, there were no beneficiaries when grants were supposed to be distributed. “One of the critical impediments to sustainability is that our wage bill is ridiculously high. We are sitting at 69% which is unsustainable,” said Kwele. She said the post office reduced staff by 4%, but had to hire 3 000 again on a temporary basis after taking over grant distribution. IFP MP Zandile Majozi said: “You spoke about spaza shops. I want to know what risks you have considered. How will it work?” Kwele said spaza shops would not be given cash, but point-of-service machines where recipients could withdraw the money.
