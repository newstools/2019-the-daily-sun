THAPELO Legobate has been in a state of shock since Saturday. While digging a hole for a pit toilet, he found a human skull in the yard of the house he had been living in his whole life! The 30-year-old from Number One Village in Taung, North West, told Daily Sun the house belonged to his grandparents. Thapelo had no idea why there were bones buried in the yard. “At first I thought the bones belonged to a dead animal, but after digging further I discovered it was a human skull,” he said. He said before he found the bones, he dreamt of a woman telling him to dig a hole next to his old pit latrine. “I believe whoever was buried there wanted us to know we were not alone,” he said. “I didn’t believe in spirits speaking to the living before, but now I do. “I called the police after the discovery and the remains were put back in the grave. “We’re going to consult a sangoma to determine whether our yard needs to be cleansed.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh confirmed the discovery. “The yard is right next to a graveyard, so we believe the bones were from there,” said Myburgh. “We’ve put the bones back and closed the grave. There’s no case being investigated.” Sangoma Kingsley Maboa said the family needed to slaughter a goat and sprinkle its blood in the yard. Said Maboa: “This is to let whoever is buried there know they’re not fighting with them. “They should tell the dead they want peace.”
