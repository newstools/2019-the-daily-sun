NOTHING would please Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama more than helping his side end their four-year trophy drought. But in order to play a key role in The Glamour Boys’ quest to reclaiming their glory days, Manyama is aware that he will have to double his efforts. The 29-year-old has gotten off to a bright start, scoring three goals and providing an assist in his seven matches so far. His contribution has helped Amakhosi climb to the summit of the Absa Premiership standings after seven matches – a position they will be desperate to cling on to until the end of the season. Having recovered fully from injuries that hampered his progress in his debut season at Naturena, Manyama now wants to make his mark. And judging by his early season form, the Tembisa-born star looks in the mood to improve on his best ever goal return in the league which came just over two years ago in the colours of Cape Town City. Manyama scored 13 goals in 29 appearances to clinch the golden boot in the 2016-17 season. “Coming from an injury ravaged season like I had last season, it’s important that I play as much as possible,” said Manyama. “And the position that I play, I’m guaranteed to get a lot of scoring chances. I get a chance each and every game it’s just a matter of finishing those chances when they come my way.” Despite impressing in the early stages of the season, Manyama was not included in Molefi Ntseki’s latest Bafana Bafana squad to face Mali in October. Although he would relish a return to the national team set-up, Manyama said he was happy to focus on achieving success with his club at the moment. He will be hoping to help his side to yet another three points tomorrow when they face Golden Arrows at the FNB Stadium (7.30pm).
