A few weeks ago we saw the Princes of Cool, Pamela, trending on our social media platforms and little did we know that she will end up on our TV screens. The 10 year old who went viral after her school teacher posted a video of her acting cool with shades on in class was poached for a GAME stores advert. A twitter user who works in commercials got the word out that they were looking for the little girl to feature her in a campaign and luckily, someone on twitter knew who she was. Mr Mahlangu shared a thread on twitter detailing the long process that it took them to finally get to her as the young girl is also not from around Johannesburg. In the thread, Mahlangu details that  they faced challenges that included them dealing with the department of Labour. "Our government says we can’t shoot with her, so she can’t travel to joburg. Now, for those that don’t know, children from 14yrs and under can’t shoot TV shows and adverts without being permitted by Dept of Labour. For that to happen the child needs a birth certificate. Our Princess is 10yrs old and she doesn’t have a birth certificate." he wrote. "We beg Dept of Labour, we write letters, we explain and over explain the benefits she stands to get and basically they say, if she doesn’t have an ID number it means she doesn’t exist. I asked, how come DoE says she exists, she’s a scholar right? What had become an exciting adventure had sadly ended. Needless to express the disappointment. We shoot the Ad. Then the Director says let’s get the teacher to send us the original video. The teacher grants us permission to use it in post. All this has lead us to this beautiful tag line “YOU’VE GOT GAME” cause Pamela certainly does have game And this is the commercial." he tweeted. "Burning question: did she get paid? YEAH YEP YES. Adverts pay all talent on screen after 30 days." Mahlangu concluded his thread.
