THE family of Sindiso Magaqa are still hoping the people accused of his murder will finally reveal who hired them to kill him. The murder trial will begin in the Ramsgate High Court in Port Edward, KZN, on Monday and is expected to run until 8 November. Sindiso’s brother, Lwazi, told Daily Sun yesterday the family had no doubt the people who killed his brother were hired. Lwazi said the reason they believed the men were hired was because accused Sibonelo Myeza said in court he didn’t know Sindiso before his death. “We’re happy that the trial will finally begin. We’ve been waiting for it,” said Lwazi. Sindiso, an ANC councillor and former ANC Youth League secretary, was sprayed with bullets while sitting in his car at Ibisi Village in 2017. He was rushed to hospital and died three months later. His two fellow Umzimkhulu councillors, Jabu Mzizi and Nontsikelelo Mafu, who were with him, were injured. The first suspect, Sibusiso Ncengwa, was bust in Westville Prison while awaiting trial for an armed robbery case. Former cop Sibonelo Myeza and businessman Mbulelo Mpofana were arrested in March this year. Former Harry Gwala mayor Mluleki Ndobe and Umzimkhulu municipal manager Zweliphansi Sikhosana were released due to a lack of evidence.
