THE main contributing factor to South Africa’s defeat at the hands of Japan in the 2015 Rugby World Cup opener in Brighton was touched on by the colossal Springbok lock, Lood de Jager, at a press conference this week. “We’re well-prepared for this game, whereas we weren’t well-prepared for the game in Brighton,” said De Jager with a little chortle that may have emphasised just how badly prepared the Boks were in the first-ever meeting between the two nations that will clash in today’s World Cup quarter-final at Tokyo Stadium. “That’s not to say that Japan didn’t play well that day. They played very well and deserved to win the game.” They did indeed, but Boks’ complacency contributed in no small part to one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history, if not the biggest. The current coach, Rassie Erasmus, who was involved in the 2011 campaign as Peter de Villiers’ technical adviser, said this week that he encountered the same problem in the World Cup before that. “Being in a situation as I am now, where we just every now and then have a maximum of maybe one or two guys not being able to train, is new for me at a World Cup. “And one of the things we’ve worked toward this year was to get the right balance between experience and guys who may not be as experienced but are fit and in good form,” said Erasmus. And that really, in a nutshell, is why the Boks should be expected to bury the ghost of Brighton once and for all by scoring an emphatic victory they should have had four years ago. They know what to expect this time. Japan are no longer an unknown factor. Most importantly, the Boks are showing them respect. “It definitely helps that we played against Japan five weeks ago. We now know what they’re all about and we’ve been able to prepare accordingly,” said De Jager. – Supersport.com
