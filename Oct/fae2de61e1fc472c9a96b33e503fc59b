Hey MizzB MY girlfriend and I used to party a lot before we had kids. Now she’s doing it alone and I’m not happy about it. I think she has a drinking problem and this bothers me because we plan to have a future together. I’m worried that her behaviour might ruin our plans. I’m 25 years old and she’s 21. Please help. Hi Guy It takes two people for a relationship to succeed. When both partners are determined to make a partnership work, it becomes easy. They work together towards achieving the same goal. Change can’t be enforced on people. A person should be willing and prepared to change. Send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za
