FORMER spy boss Lieutenant-General Richard Mdluli employed seven relatives who cost crime intelligence R5 million in less than two years. This was according to the evidence of whistle-blower Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo at the Zondo Commission yesterday. Naidoo, who’s under witness protection, said Mdluli, Colonel Hein Barnard and Major-General Solomon Lazarus created a parallel structure to employ their relatives as agents of crime intelligence. He said about 250 people were hired during the recruitment drive that started in 2010. “I really didn’t know what they did, sir. This was a parallel structure that was created for their employment. But they did nothing at the office.” Naidoo said he was instructed to pay their salaries, medical bills and petrol claims. He said Mdluli’s relatives would have cost a minimum of R200 000 in salaries. “Over R5 million was exceeded taking care of these agents. I believe it was this amount. This was from March 2010, from their inception, to October 2011, when I went into witness protection.” Naidoo identified FM 24, FM 29, FM 26, FM 28, FM 27, FM 25 and FM 30, as Mdluli’s relatives. Their real identities could not be revealed as they are, or were working within crime intelligence. Naidoo said FM 27 and FM 28 rarely reported for work as whenever he called them, they’d be either at home or shopping. He said one day Lazarus told him when they heard Hawks investigator, Godfrey Lebea, was probing the 250 appointments, they considered to place his wife’s name on the list to blackmail him. He said four of the relatives were employed in the cyber crime unit and were running an undercover internet cafe. He said he was responsible for setting up a front company and it cost about R75 000.
