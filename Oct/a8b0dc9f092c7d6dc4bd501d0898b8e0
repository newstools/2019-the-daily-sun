CLUB Brugge forward Emmanuel Bonaventure was ecstatic after scoring twice in his side’s surprise 2-2 draw at Real Madrid in the Champions League but now faces a painful double session in a tattoo parlour after coming good on a pre-match pledge. The Nigerian striker was caught on camera looking awestruck as he walked around the Santiago Bernabeu before Tuesday’s clash and said if he was able to score at Real’s temple he would honour the occasion by getting himself inked up. “Santiago Bernabeu, this is a dream. A lot of people didn’t even think they would come here to play. If I score then I will get a tattoo on my skin,” he said in a video posted on the club’s Youtube channel. The 21-year-old did not take long to fulfil his promise, giving the Belgian side a shock lead in the ninth minute by beating Real keeper Thibaut Courtois with an unorthodox finish. He struck again later in the first half to make his side believe in an unlikely victory at the home of the 13-times European champions. . “I guess I will now have to get two tattoos,” he said – REUTERS
