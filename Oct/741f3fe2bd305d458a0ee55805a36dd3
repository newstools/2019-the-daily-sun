They revealed that for the first time and only for this years final there would be a price money of R25 000 per goal scored by each player, with the player that would bbe voted Man of the Match getting the same amount of R25 000. SuperSport striker, Thamsanqa Gabuza is currently leading the charts as he has three goals in the MTN8 Cup on his name. Highlands Park coach Owen Da Gama, revealed that club boss Brad Kaftel has told him to notify the players that they will pocket half of the prize money should they win the tournament. “I think they deserve it, they really deserve it. They have worked so hard to get to this point. I don’t know how much I’ll be getting,” revealed Da Gama. “This has been a fairy-tale story for us.” On the other hand SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo who has been given the mandate to win the tournament, insists that his main concern is building a squad that will be able to compete. “I focus on the steady progression of the team because you can win one trophy and still get fired," he said. "It’s key that our players do understand that we win together and we lose together. I think each individual achieves more if we win as a team as well, team work would be key."
