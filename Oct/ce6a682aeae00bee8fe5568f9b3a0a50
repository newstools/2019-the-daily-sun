Police in the Northern Cape are on the hunt for four men who
robbed the Windsorton police station on Wednesday night. Windsorton is about 60km north of Kimberley. It is alleged that four men – who were armed – entered the
station, attacked and tied up two officers who were on duty, before robbing
them of their service pistols. The men then stole two other 9mm pistols and two R5 rifles
from the station's safe, before escaping in a white Audi A4 with a Botswana
registration plate, Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo Mnisi said. A customer involved in a business robbery at a supermarket
in Johannesburg is being praised on social media for how calm he remained
throughout the ordeal Mnisi said the men also fled with 66 rounds of ammunition. "On their way, the suspects proceeded to a nearby
petrol station where they filled fuel for about R1 000. They told a petrol
attendant they would pay using speed point, but fled the scene as the attendant
fetched the machine," Mnisi said. Mnisi said the Hawks were investigating. NEWS24
