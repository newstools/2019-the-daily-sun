KAIZER Chiefs striker Leonardo Castro has finally broken his silence about Samir Nurkovic’s goal that broke the heart of Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane. Mosimane argued that Nurkovic's opening goal in their 2-0 defeat to Amakhosi at Loftus Versveld was offside as he claims that Castro touched the ball from an offside position. But the Safa’s Review Committee came out in defence of the decision by referee Victor Hlongwane and his assistants to allow the goal to stand. However, Castro insist that he never touched the ball after Nurkovic connected a cross from Reeve Frosler to give his side the lead in the first half. “If I had touched the ball that means it was my goal, but I didn’t touch it. Nurkovic was onside, so it’s a clear goal,” said Castro during a media briefing in Naturena on Wednesday ahead of  their Telkom Knockout quarter-final Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (3pm). Castro said he will take a bit longer to get used to playing alongside Nurkovic while it’s easier to play with Khama Billiat. “It will take a bit longer to know each other on the pitch. In training session we do the right things to prepare ourselves for the game. I have known Khama for a long time, so we know each other well, we can close our eyes and play together.” Castro said they are ready to execute coach Ernst Middendorp’s instructions on Saturday. “The instruction is clear, to move into spaces, us strikers we need to be calm (in front of goal) and take the right decision.”
