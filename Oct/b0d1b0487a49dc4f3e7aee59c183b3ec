WHEN Ntakadzeni Mathiki’s sister Adivhaho (8) fell into an open trench, he tried to save her from drowning. But the 10-year-old boy also fell into the 6m-deep trench and drowned. The unfortunate incident happened in Muledane kasi, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, on Saturday. The family said they wanted justice for their little ones’ deaths. The trench was allegedly left open by a contractor who was working on a bridge. The family said they will sue the contractor. The children’s uncle, Nkangwiseni Masithi (41), said the contractor must take full responsibility. “There were no tapes showing it’s a danger zone. The contractor didn’t consider safety measures. We want him to take full responsibility,” said Masithi. The kids’ aunt, Farisani Masinge (53), said the siblings would be buried separately as they shared a father but had different mothers. Ntakadzeni would be buried in Muledane on Saturday, and Adivhaho in Madombidzha on Sunday. Limpopo Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale urged parents to always track their children’s whereabouts. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said police opened two inquest dockets. Efforts to get a comment from Mkhacani Construction were unsuccessful as the person who answered the phone kept hanging up.
