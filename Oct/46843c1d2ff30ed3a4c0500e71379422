She was told he died, and she had no reason not to believe
it. Two years later, she bumped into her former lover at a local
restaurant. Rachel was 18 years-old when she started dating the chef who
worked at the local pub. The Mirror reports that things took a bit of a turn
when her boyfriend reportedly lost his job and asked to borrow hundreds of
pounds from her. He reportedly paid some of the money back, but when they
broke up a few months later. She claims he refused to pay the rest and stopped
replying to her messages. Following that furniture was gone, bed was gone, everything was
gone, where the boyfriend lived. "The initial story was he'd gone to rehab in
Queensland." According to the publication, she wasn't completely
convinced by this, but before she had time to investigate, her ex's mum
messaged her to say her son had died. Rachel grieved the loss "in her own way" and
eventually moved on. While back in her hometown with a friend, she stopped by a
restaurant where she was shocked to discover her ex-boyfriend, very much alive
and working there. "I just went into shock," she recalls. But before she could confront him about it all, Rachel was
asked to leave the restaurant.
