THE former minister of transport, Sibusiso Ndebele, once made a memorable statement about bad drivers. Said Ndebele: “Thank you to those Mzansi drivers who want to keep donating money to the state by continuously committing faults on the road and getting fined.” But now bad drivers face more than a mere fine and losing a bit of change. Thanks to AARTO, they’ll have points added against their licence until it’s suspended. AARTO also means considerable changes are on the way for both drivers of company cars and fleet operators. MasterDrive managing director, Eugene Herbert, told SunWheels AARTO would also affect businesses. Said Eugene: “A proxy needs to be appointed to keep track of drivers and subsequent fines. That proxy can’t be held personally responsible for the fines, but it’s an infringement to not keep track of drivers and reassign the fines to the correct driver.” Eugene said future and past employment contracts need to contain a clause that allows businesses to get information on employees’ infringements. “If an employee’s license is suspended as a result of fines obtained in their work and personal capacity, yet they continue to drive for your company, the company can also be held responsible for this. These are just some of the considerations one needs to make with the introduction of AARTO.” Eugene said fleet drivers would need to pay attention to their driving behaviour. “When you face infringements, drivers need to know what process follows this. AARTO allows drivers to have points removed from their record. If you depend on your driving license to earn an income, clearing your record following infringements is important.”
