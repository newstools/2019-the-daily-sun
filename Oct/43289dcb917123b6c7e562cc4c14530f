THEY say one is never too old to dream. And mkhulu John Zililo (74) refuses to give up on his dream to open a restaurant in his kasi. The dream was inspired by late former president Nelson Mandela in the late 1990s. The energetic mkhulu said he worked as a waiter at a restaurant Madiba visited years ago. He served Madiba mashed potatoes and cream of mushroom soup.  John said he left to go continue his duties in the kitchen and he was told Madiba wanted to see him. “I was surprised and he told me how pleased he was with my food and he called a photographer to take a photo of me with him.” He said he was working at the then President Hotel in Joburg. Among those who were present were presidents Hastings Banda from Malawi and Kenneth Kaunda from Zambia. “It was a big event. I was honoured to have served these great men.” READ: DAD REVEALS WHY HE DECIDED TO PULL OTHER DAUGHTER OUT The photo of him and Mandela is so special to him that he’s even framed it. He showed the photo to the SunTeam. And this has now inspired him to open his own restaurant. John from Boiketlong in Sebokeng, Vaal, has built a shack structure at his home to start his restaurant. He said he’ll grow from there. “I want to specialise in African cuisine and other light menus. I want to put this place on the map,” he said. Resident Sammy Monareng said he was excited and proud of John. “That old man is energetic and passionate about his restaurant dream as he always talks about it.”
