The newlywed couples Somizi and Mohale are over a hundred
hours as husbands. To celebrate this cute milestone Mohale received a hundred
roses from his lover and he shared with his followers. A hundred roses
symbolise a gesture of devotion and this is the sign that the two are so into
each other. He posted a picture on social media a picture of him holding
the roses with the caption: “Bae came by my office to give me a hundred roses
for a hundred hours of being his husband.” Mohale and Somizi celebrated their second anniversary on
heritage day and the same weekend they tie the knot. They celebrated their
wedding with friends and family at Kibler Park, South of Joburg. While celebrating his flowers, Mohale had to also reprimand
some of his followers who made funny comments on his post. One of his followers said they would love to see him do the
same for Somizi and pray that their marriage works. His respond was: “Who said
I haven’t? Y’all like attention. Tsek”
