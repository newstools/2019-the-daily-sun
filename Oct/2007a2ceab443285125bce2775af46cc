MTHATHA Airport will now have flights to Cape Town and East London. The airport only had flights to Joburg, but SA Express added another route. This after the Civil Aviation Authority downgraded it due to non-compliance with Civil Aviation Regulations of 2011. The routes will start operating on 15 November. Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe welcomed the addition of the routes. “This move will greatly benefit the community of Mthatha and surrounding areas who have been calling for the introduction of new routes,” said Tikana-Gxothiwe. “We also believe it will go a long way in reducing congestion on the R61 from the Western Cape border to the eastern side of the province as it’s one of the busiest corridors during the festive season and accounts for many fatal crashes.” SA Express started operating in Mthatha in December and promised to expand routes. Spokeswoman Mpho Majatladi said: “Offering our customers added convenience on our enhanced route network is a priority, especially during the upcoming festive period.” Ncedo Kolanisi, who normally flies to Cape Town, said: “We really need more routes to other provinces.”
