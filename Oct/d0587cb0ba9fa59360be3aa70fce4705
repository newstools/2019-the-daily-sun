WHITEY Hlophe needs help to marry the love of his life! The 35-year-old from Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun he couldn’t afford a white wedding because he had to bury three family members. Whitey said he was supposed to marry Delisile Mathibela (29), whom he had been dating for many years, next month. “Even though I don’t have enough money to cover all the wedding costs, there’s no way I’ll postpone the wedding,” he said. The father of three said he used all the money he had saved for his wedding to bury his mum who died of natural causes in 2010. He said he started saving again but then his dad died in 2015, followed by his younger brother. All died of natural causes. “I had to sacrifice my happiness to take care of these situations.” Whitey, who worked as an organiser for the South African Commercial Catering Union, said he spent almost R60 000 on the three funerals. He said he had bought wedding rings, hired a catering company and designers were making the wedding clothes. “If I don’t get money it will be a disaster. I don’t even qualify for a loan as I have only had my current job for six months. “People are talking about my wedding day in the community,” he said. Whitey said he was the breadwinner at home as his siblings were unemployed. He appealed to Good Samaritans to help him have a beautiful wedding. His young brother, Zweli (24), confirmed that Whitey’s the breadwinner, and that he buried his parents and brother.
