THESE two friends, who’re both living with disabilities, are worried. Carmen Randall (40) and Hilda Motaung (82) from Eersterust, Tshwane, have been waiting for their RDP for many years. Hilda is blind and Carmen is deaf. They said the government wasn’t concerned about their well-being. Carmen said every time she visited the municipal offices in Mamelodi, she was told the system was offline. “I suspect they’re taking advantage of me because of my disability.” Carmen said she also looks after her diabetic and deaf mum (68). Hilda first applied for an RDP in 1996, but she’s still waiting for the house. The mum of eight said she became blind in 1972. “I can’t see anything and I have to believe whatever the officials tell me,” she said. Community leader Maggie Snyders (56) said it was disappointing to see people living with disabilities still waiting for RDPs. Gauteng human settlements spokesman Tahir Sema said Carmen applied for a house in 2015, but it was declined because she didn’t get a doctor to complete a form confirming she’s living with a disability. “The department contacted Carmen, but her phone was on voicemail. We urge her to approach the nearest department office to fill in the form correctly,” he said. Sema said Hilda’s application was approved in August and she’d be allocated a house in Danville soon.
