ARTS and culture director general, Vusumuzi Mkhize, has denied that R100 million went missing from a fund aimed at empowering artists. Giving MPs a breakdown of money distributed by the Mzansi Golden Economy programme yesterday, Mkhize said Ladysmith Black Mambazo will get R36 million over the next three yeas. He said the group received R12 million of the allocated funding this year. “When they came with the idea, they wanted to start a mobile academy with a view to building a proper academy,” he said. “Their concept was to go around the country and use the languages of provinces they visited. “We must get rid of the myth that this is about indoctrinating people with Zulu songs. This is incorrect and misleading.” Mkhize said allegations that money was released to the group to record a CD with former president Jacob Zuma were malicious. “There was at first an allegation that the eThekwini metro funded the project. This is untrue.” Mkhize said the department was funding Indoni Youth Empowerment and had pumped R18 million into the project in the last two financial years and would contribute R20 million in the next two years. He said the department was holding events such as the Usiba Awards to empower artists. All the organisations that received money had to give a breakdown of how it was spent. Ladysmith Black Mambazo manager Xolani Majozi couldn’t be reached at the time of going to print.
