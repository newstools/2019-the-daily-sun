THERE is no doubting the enormity of work facing Jozef Vukusic in his quest to lift AmaZulu from the doldrums. Eight games into the season and Usuthu are still languishing bottom of the log with five points, one ahead of basement dwellers Chippa United. And it seems they will spend some time there before they can move to a safer place mid-table, judging by their performance in their embarrassing 5-0 cup defeat against Mamelodi Sundowns. But is Vukusic the man equal to the tough task? What is evident is that the Slovakian is finding the PSL rather difficult than he did in his first spell with Polokwane City. He has only won once in four league matches and has failed in his first hurdle in the knockout cup. “There are many areas that we have to work on, but are learning,” Vukusic said. “We are now focusing on the league to make sure that we get maximum points in the next game, and focus on how to move from where we are in the league. “When you play against the best team you can see everything. The cup is over and we can focus on the league, which is important because the situation is not easy there for us. “It’s now four games and we are still struggling with the mentality of the team. That is very important because we are not in a good situation and we need the mentality.” Vukusic received rave reviews for his incredible work at Polokwane City last season, before quitting over disagreement with management. But he appears to be facing a formidable task of turning around Usuthu’s flagging fortunes. Vukusic returns to familiar territory when AmaZulu visit Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm), undoubtedly looking to prove a point or two. “We have now three tough games coming against direct opponents. We will use the information gathered in the coming games.”
