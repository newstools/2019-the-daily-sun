SHE gave her two kids poison and even drank some herself! But the two boys, aged between two and four, survived while the mum died. According to a resident, the 21-year-old from Clocolan, Free State, was a single parent who struggled to make ends meet as she was unemployed. She allegedly forced her two boys to drink the poison on Friday. But the eldest refused to drink it and is now in his grandparents’ care, while the younger one’s in hospital. The woman’s friend said she always complained about how she struggled to feed her kids. “She seemed okay on Friday afternoon. Her last words to me were that she was going home to prepare pap and milk for her children,” said the friend. She said she learnt about her friend’s death after her neighbour found her lying in front of her gate. “When I arrived at the scene I thought she had been killed, but I learnt she drunk poison together with her younger child. “Black liquid came out her mouth and ears. Her four-year-old told me his mum wanted them to eat at night, but he didn’t because he was tired and wanted to sleep.” The woman’s aunt said: “We don’t want to talk about what happened, but my niece was stressed about being unemployed. “The father of her two children was the only breadwinner, but he left her a year ago.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “An inquest docket was opened after a 21-year-old woman was found lying in the street next to her gate. “She was certified dead by Emergency Medical Services. “No foul play is suspected and no one was arrested.”
