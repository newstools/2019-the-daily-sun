While playing for African Wanderers in the mid-1990s,
Sibusiso Zuma formed a deadly partnership with Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe and
Phumlani “BMX” Mkhize. Together with Mkhize, they were snapped up by Orlando Pirates
while Nomvethe went to Kaizer Chiefs. At Pirates, he created magic and it did not take long for
him to be affectionately loved by the Buccaneers faithfuls. He was soon selected for Bafana Bafana where he continued to
make a name for himself.  He then earned himself a move abroad in Denmark where had
the supporters of FC Copenhagen eating from the palm of his hands. In Denmark, he was given the nickname of "Zuma the
Puma" after some amazing goals he scored and also for his jaw-dropping
dribbling skills. He is mostly remembered for that bicycle kick goal which was
voted Danish Goal of the Year and also The Superliga Goal of the Decade. After five magical years in Denmark, he went across to
Germany and joined Arminia Bielefeld where he remained for four years. Zuma went to represent Bafana Bafana 66 times and scored
some important goals for the SA Senior National Team. He later came back to South Africa and finished off his
career at Mamelodi Sundowns, Vasco da Gama and SuperSport United. What is your fondest memory of "Rhee" Zuma...
