MAMELODI Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango has lost his father, Gabriel Onyango, the club has confirmed. As a result, the 34-year-old stopper will not be available for Downs’ match against Highlands Park as well as Saturday’s clash against Kaizer Chiefs. He will be traveling back home to Kampala, Uganda to prepare for his father’s funeral. “It is with great sadness that we learned of the passing on of the father of Denis Onyango. The Club has released Denis to mourn this great loss and he will immediately leave for Uganda with his family,” Downs said in a statement. “He has the full support of all his teammates, technical team, management, Board and the Club President. We all wish him and his family all the strength during these trying times.” Onyango’s father, who was born in November 1952, was a retired member of the Departed Asian’s Property Custodian Board (DAPCB) in Uganda. He and Onyango’s mother, Nakato Musoke Olive Onyango, were blessed with four children, Dennis being the third-born.
