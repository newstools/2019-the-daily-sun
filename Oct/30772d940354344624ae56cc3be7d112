RESIDENTS of Hostel One live in fear that their kids will drown in kak. People from the area in Mangaung told Daily Sun the problem started three weeks ago when a water pipe burst and construction workers who came to fix it dug a hole and left it open. Residents said their yards looked like ponds and there were frogs all over. READ: QWABE TWINS DUMP IDOLS SA! Avela Phangumso (29) said: “I can’t get out of my house as a private contractor left a deep trench in front of it. The workers promised they’d come back to close it, but we never saw them again. “My kids are not safe. When they come back from school, I have to lock them inside. We can’t sleep at night as the frogs make a lot of noise.” He suspected it was caused by burst underground pipes. Ntsikelelo Nguse said a pipe was leaking for over a week and was reported to the municipality, but nothing was done.

After some time, someone rescued me,” he said. “I lost my phone and money, and had to throw my clothes away when I got home. I hope the municipality fixes this problem urgently before we lose lives.” Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said the matter would be attended to soon.
