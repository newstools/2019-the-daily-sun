Convicted child rapist Nicholas Ninow has been sentenced to life in the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Judge Mokhine Mosopa sentenced Ninow to five years in prison for the possession of drugs, and five years for defeating the administration of justice. Mosopa ordered that the sentence in count three will run concurrently with the sentence in count one which is life imprisonment. Ninow's full sentence is life imprisonment and five years. Mosopa said that Ninow's particulars be included in the sexual offenders list.  The effect of this order is that in future Ninow may not be employed in the environment that involves children. He admitted to using drugs while in prison and having suicidal thoughts but said he would be a good person if given a second chance. Psychologist Marina Genis, arguing for a lighter sentence, said Ninow grew up in an environment where his mother and grandfather were drug addicts. She said if he didnâ€™t undergo rehabilitation treatment, he was likely to offend again. Probation officer, Dete Kelder recommended that Ninow be handed down a life sentence for rape. His grandmother, Pauline Gereck said when Ninow was high, he was a bad person but he was good when he was sober. SOURCE: NEWS24
