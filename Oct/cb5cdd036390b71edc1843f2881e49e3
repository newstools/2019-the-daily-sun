IT IS a gift from the ancestors! That’s how gobela Grace Ndlovu described a mysterious springbok horn she apparently found in her toilet yesterday morning. She told Daily Sun she’d just returned from the river after helping a sick woman when she found it. Grace from Lawley, south of Joburg, became a trainee sangoma in 1983 and later a sangoma.  She’s now a gobela and said she’s trained more than 15 sangomas and healed many. She said she had never received a gift from her ancestors in her years practising as a sangoma. “We came back home way before midday. Everything was normal except in the bathroom. “A horn was hanging from my toilet seat. At first I was shocked and puzzled, because all doors and windows were locked. No one could have gained entry.” Grace said the horn looked very beautiful, clean and new. “My spirit was immediately at peace and filled with joy. It was my ancestors who brought me a gift. “It symbolises their happiness with how I’ve been using the spiritual gift they’ve granted me.” Grace said a mysterious gift was normal among sangomas and she was over the moon. OUR GOAT IS A GIFT FROM THE ANCESTORS! “They left the gift where they knew I’d easily find it. I’ll do a small ritual to show gratitude,” she said. The woman who was with her said Grace was happy. Said the woman: “She went into a trance after the discovery. I became scared, not knowing what was happening. “Happily, she said it was a gift from the ancestors. I hadn’t been well for a long time but I feel better.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi agreed with the gobela. “This is a gift, either from her ancestors or patients she helped. The horn represent happiness. It means rituals she performed on the woman were a success.”
