KWAITO icon Lebo Mathosa’s long-term lover Sibongile Ngubane is unfazed by the hype around the late star’s upcoming biopic. According to Sibongile, she instead remembers the person she fell in love with. Said Sibongile of the legend who died 13 years ago in a car accident: “I’d just returned from America when I first met Lebo, and that was in 1994. She was one of a kind. What drew me to her was her personality that she was alwaysfree-spirited and unapologetically herself.” Sibongile was also one of the late star’s choreographers and dancers. She was roped into the Dream: The Lebo Mathosa Story biopic as a consultant. She recalled her emotional roller-coaster while working on the doccie. Explained Sibongile: “There were many emotional moments for me while working on the series. That’s because it reminded me of the beautiful soul Lebo was and the amazing time we had together.” She said although Lebo appeared as a carefree person, the star was quite coy. “Because of showbiz she had to become the Lebo people wanted to see. She was quite a reserved person but obviously had to be outlandish because she was a public personality. “You know, Lebo was a very compassionate and loving person, who was extremely dedicated to her work.”
