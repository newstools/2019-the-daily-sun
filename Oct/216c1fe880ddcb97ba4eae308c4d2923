FORMER  Mamelodi Sundowns & AmaGlug-Glug player Lovers Mohlala has slammed PSL clubs for treating legends like dirt. The retired former Brazilians star is lamenting the kind of treatment that former stars get from the clubs and football bodies. Speaking with SunSport, Mohlala said that retired players contributed so much to SA football and that they deserve a better treatment. Said Mohlala: “Retired SA players have to beg for match tickets. We are being treated like we did not contribute and play a role. Look at my FaceBook profile, I am not happy. If you look overseas, players like Didier Drogba, are still getting important seats in the VIP section. They’re still recognized and respected. But here in South Africa you find Soapie stars and Slay Queens in the VIP section. Those people did not play football.” “I am going to be honest, Sundowns are still giving me nice tickets when I ask, but what about other players? What about Bafana Bafana matches? I played for the SA Under-23s and the senior national team. But you find TV stars and actors in the VIP suits. Why can’t we be like England and honour former players because we always see former players being treated nicely. The other day a club owner walked into the VIP suit and he did not even greet me. I felt very bad like I did not belong there.” Mohlala added: “During Soccer Awards, you find TV and Soapie stars giving out soccer awards. Why can’t we have soccer legends giving out awards. You don’t see soccer players dishing out Entertainment awards. This is disappointing. “Players who have retired do not get tickets. Only politicians and Slay Queens get tickets. Why are soccer bosses treating former players in this way? I have seen many former players being treated like they did not contribute. Something must be done and we must learn from European who respect former players," Mohlala added.
