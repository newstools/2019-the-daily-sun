MAMELODI Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana says they will be able to juggle the tight schedule they have to defend the league title, challenge for the Caf Champions League and wrestle the Telkom Knockout away from champions Baroka FC. Downs will battle it out against AmaZulu in the Telkom Knockout last 16 round on the weekend of 18 to 19 October, before they resume their league schedule with a date against Highlands Park four days later. The Tshwane giants will then switch their focus to the continental competition towards the end of next month, where they will meet Angolan side Petro de Luanda in their first group stage match. Said Kekana: “We know there is a lot of football that has to be played. “It’s for us to ensure we win our matches. “We have had this tight schedule for so many years now. We know the logistics in it, and we should try do the basics right and win our matches. “If we do that we stand a chance of winning trophies.” However, Kekana said it would be suicidal to undermine AmaZulu, who are still trying to get their footing under new coach Jozef Vukusic. Usuthu won just one match in eight Absa Premiership matches so far. “I have watched three of AmaZulu matches. “They’ve got a new coach now and those boys are playing well. They could have won easily against Kaizer Chiefs. It was just unfortunate because of the decision of the referee and his linesman,” he said. “When I look at their team, it’s solid and they are dangerous. We can’t take them for granted. We want to ensure we do our homework right. When I look at their team, they have Bongi Ntuli, who is still a good striker. If you manage (Bongi) and their two midfielders, you stand a chance of winning the match. “They are a difficult team to play against, but we will plan accordingly to overcome them.”
