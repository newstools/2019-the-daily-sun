THERE were more theft and robbery victims last year, but the number of other crimes committed remained the same. The Victims of Crime report was released by Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke in Tshwane yesterday. He said it showed an increase in sexual offences. “Western Cape had the highest percentage of street robbery.” Maluleke said in that province, 62% of these cases involved the use of knives and 37% of guns. “The survey shows that in 2018-2019, there were almost 260 000 incidences of home robberies, affecting about 1% of all households in South Africa. The most common weapons used were guns at 54% and knives at 47%.” There were 32 000 hijackings of vehicles, including trucks. At least 85% were reported. There were 500 000 incidents of assault, with most victims being men and young adults. The percentage of people who felt safe walking at night increased from 32% in 2017-2018 to 35%. “More men felt safer during the day and night.” Maluleke said 45% of people living in metros felt unsafe at night, compared to 42% in urban areas and 39% in rural areas. There were almost 1,3 million incidents of housebreaking. He said 12 000 murders were committed and there were 1,2 million incidents of theft of personal property.
