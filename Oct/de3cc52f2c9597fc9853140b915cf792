WHEN Uzalo actor Simphiwe Majozi arrived at the Community Benefit Fair on Saturday, kids went crazy. Although other celebrities attended the event at Inanda Dam, north of Durban, no one else got kids as excited. Simphiwe said he was very happy to see kids having such a good time. Kids stood outside the tent where Imbewu actors Nkanyiso Mchunu and Nathi Kheswa were sitting, and tried to get his attention. When Simphiwe left the tent, pupils ran to grab him, give him hugs and take photos with him. Simphiwe told Daily Sun: “I didn’t know they enjoy my character this much. I’m just doing my work, which is something I’m enjoying.” Lungelo Ndlela (13) from Langalibalele Primary said he was a big fan of Simphiwe. “He makes me laugh on Uzalo. I also think he’s a good person because he didn’t chase us away when we went to take photos with him.”
