SHE’S a sangoma and she’s supposed to fight evil. But sangoma Mendi Moleya said is powerless against the tokoloshe tormenting her. The 61-year-old from Diepsloot, North of Joburg, said she believes jealous rivals sent it. “People hear me screaming at the tokoloshe to leave. People who don’t understand what I’m going through think I’m mad.” She said the creature told her it would never rest until she surrendered to it. She said she qualified as a sangoma five years ago but was unable to help people as the tokoloshe took all her powers. The gogo said the tokoloshe also took her belongings and sometimes slept with her at night. “My groceries don’t last. When I buy groceries everything disappears,” she said. Her cousin, Magdeline Moleya (57) said: “She doesn’t sleep as this tokoloshe haunts her.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said Mendi’s spirit needed to be urgently cleansed.
