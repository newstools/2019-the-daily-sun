THE trial  of controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday. The trial was postponed because the defence team wanted to approach Supreme Court of Appeal to challenge Judge Irma Schoeman's decision to allow the trial to go ahead in the Port Elizabeth High Court. In August, Schoeman turned down the defence’s application for leave to appeal her decision challenging the court's jurisdiction and centralisation of charges against the trio. She said she was dismissing the application because the charge sheet has sufficient information for the defence’s preparations. She further stated that the accused knew about the charges in the previous case, presided by Judge Mandela Makaula and had proceeded without any appeal. Judge Schoeman presided over the trial that started afresh in July after the previous judge in the matter, Makaula, recused himself from the case. Omotoso, Sulani and Sitho face a total of 97 sex related charges.
