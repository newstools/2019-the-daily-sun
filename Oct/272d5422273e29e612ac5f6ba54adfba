A GRADE 9 pupil was arrested at his school for housebreaking and theft yesterday. The 17-year-old was bust at Adam Masebe High School in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, during the Gauteng Community Safety Department’s Take Charge campaign. According to the department, the suspect is a repeat offender. This time he was taken in after breaking into the Tshwaranang Children’s Lives Home in May and stole valuable items. Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko led members of the Tshwane Metro cops and the police in the operation. At the Hammanskraal Train Station, dagga and Bluetooth nyaope were found abandoned when addicts fled the precinct after spotting the cops. Cellphones, dagga, knives, glue and potato chips suspected to have been laced with illegal substances were also found. After the search, the MEC and police called a meeting to educate residents about gender-based violence. Mazibuko told residents it was important to create a safe environment for women and children. She said it had been found that alcohol and substance abuse contributed to most crimes. “We encourage men and women to join safety structures such as safety committees. All illegal shebeens must be closed down. That can only be done when we’re organised,” she said. The MEC also urged residents to get to know each other. “It’s critical we know the people who live in our areas. Let’s also instil discipline, especially among kids,” she said.
