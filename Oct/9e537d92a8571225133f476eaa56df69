AFRO-POP singer Vusi Nova missed his gig at Macufe (Mangaung African Cultural Festival). He was booked to perform alongside local diva Thandiswa Mazwai and international star Deborah Cox just to mention a few in Bloemfontein on Saturday. Vusi posted a video on social media explaining why he was forced to disappoint his loyal fans. He said:  "apologies for not being able to perform last night at macufe, Bloemfontein. Have a bacterial infection that I’m fighting and my voice is not 100% at the moment. I feel terrible about last night, but it was something beyond my control." Will make it up to u guys somehow, I promise. Apologies once again.???? shoutout to @ntando_official @047_za and @ntsikamusic for standing in for me and having my back last night.
