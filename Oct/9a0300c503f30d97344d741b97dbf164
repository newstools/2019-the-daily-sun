A VIOLENT taxi war left commuters in the Vaal, south of Joburg, stranded and one man injured. The clash between rivals Internal Taxi Association and Evaton West Taxi Association also left several patrol vehicles damaged after they were stoned. A fight over the Eastern Road route, which is used by the two associations, broke out on Friday. Witness Zandile Khoza (31) said: “Guns were suddenly drawn and people started shooting at each other. After that some men stoned patrol cars and broke doors.” ITA spokesman Joseph Modupi said they couldn’t sit by while their cars were being stopped and shot at on a route they had a right to use. “We used to drive small cars and the government suggested we found an association because ours was not registered at the time,” he said. “We joined ITA and started using routes including Eastern Road.We’ve been using the road for over three years.” Stranded commuters shared their frustrations with Daily Sun. Sibongile Maseko (38) said: “A local taxi costs R10. Now we have to catch taxis to town that cost more. “We want them to sort out their problems as soon as possible.” Sibusiso Zwane (28) said commuters suffer when taxi associations fight. Warrant Officer Aubrey Moopeloa said Evaton police were investigating a case of attempted murder and hijacking. “No one has been arrested,” he said. The rival association couldn’t be reached for comment at the time of going to print yesterday.
