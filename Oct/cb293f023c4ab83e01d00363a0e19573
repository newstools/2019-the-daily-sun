Despite taking a huge pay cut, Thuso Phala is still the highest paid player at Black Leopards.The former SuperSport United, Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns winger, was reportedly earning R250 000 at the Tshwane giants.But he took a pay cut of more than half of his salary. He is believed to be earning more than R100 000 at Lidoda Duvha.Phala admitted that he had to adjust his lifestyle to accommodate his new salary.But he made it clear that he does not regret joining the Venda-based outfit. How many players would cope if their salaries were slashed in half, few would survive.Phala insists that he is not in Limpopo for the money, he just wants to play.Phala said he didn’t expect Lidada Duvha chairman David Thidiela to break the bank for him.Phala explains: “Obliviously I took a big cut there is no secrete about it. I’m not earning the same as I did at SuperSport, the cut is more than half of my salary. I won’t hide it it’s a huge cut, but I expected it from the beginning when my relationship with SuperSport ended. I came here knowing that the offer is far less. Leopards is a smaller team and I have to live with it.”Knowing that football is a short career, how is the adjustment to his pay-check affecting his life?  Phala boasted that he has invested his money having been playing the beautiful game for close to 15 years.He claims that he is well off and he has no money concerns.“It has only affected the pay-slip. My life is still the same. It’s also a lesson to other players not to get comfortable and chow their money without thinking. I have invested a lot during my 14 years of playing football. But the lifestyle slightly changes which was going to happen anyway.”According to Phala, Thidiela gave him a lucrative contract and he is grateful for that.  Added Phala: “He put the best possible offer on the table. I’m happy with the contract that Mr Thidiela gave me. I will do my best to repay the faith that he has shown in me.”
