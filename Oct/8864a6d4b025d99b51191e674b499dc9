SUPERSPORT United coach Kaitano Tembo says his players have put behind their MTN8 triumph, and they are raring for the Telkom Knockout success. Matsatsansta a Pitori host reigning cup champions Baroka FC in the last-16 clash at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday night (8.15pm). Three weeks ago, Tembo led his charges to the MTN8 title after defeating Highlands Park 1-0 in the final. He believes that his players can pull another surprise in this year’s Knockout cup, which they last won in 2014. “If I look at the type of players I have, the spine of the team is very experienced,” Tembo said. “I have players who have been in this situation (playing a cup competition after winning another title) before. What is key for any footballer is consistency because you are only good as your last game.” Tembo said they had disruptions in their preparations as they did not have all their players in the past two weeks. He stated: “... We did not have five of our key players. Three (Ronwen Williams, Dean Furman and Bradley Grobler) were with Bafana Bafana and two (Sipho Mbule and Jamie Webber) were with the Under-23s. “Those are our important players in the team. They had their first training session this morning. We are playing a good team in Baroka, a team that won the title last season.”
