JOSEPH Mhlongo’s future with Black Leopards looks bleak. SunSport has reliably learnt that negotiations to renew the striker’s contract, which expires in June next year, have stalled between Mhlongo and management. An insider at the club told Sunsport that the deadlock seems to be frustrating Mhlongo who has been struggling to make it into Luc Eymael’s starting line-up. The 29-year-old player could sign a pre-contract agreement with a team of his choice during the January transfer window if he fails to extend his contract with Lidoda Duvha. Said the source: “Mhlongo’s agent didn’t agree the offer that Leopards management are giving his client and this issue has now affected his performance.” However, Eymael revealed that the competition for a place in his starting line-up is very stiff and Mhlongo must double his effort to get the nod. The lanky player has made only six appearances as substitute this season. “I cannot put more than 11 players on the pitch at the same time, I have to make a choice," said Eymael "Mhlongo is a good player and one on one situation he can get better.”
