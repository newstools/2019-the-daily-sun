IT’S almost time for the matric final exams. Pupils will officially start writing their first paper, English paper 1, on 23 October. But the Mpumalanga Department of Education is concerned the number of candidates who’ve registered to write maths and physical science has dropped. MEC Bonakele Majuba said this at the state of readiness for the exams at Lowveld High School in Mbombela last Thursday. Majuba said last year, 34 643 candidates registered to write maths and only 28 177 had registered this year. He said the number of pupils registered to write physical science has dropped from 28 131 last year to 24 044. “Our desire is that we ensure more candidates register and pass mathematics and physical science since they are subjects that are very key towards the attainment of critical skills the province requires for economic emancipation,” he said. “We urge parents to encourage their children to take up mathematics and physical science subjects. “As the department, we’re training teachers now and again to ensure they can better teach the pupils.” At least 555 exam centres have been registered in the province and of these, 37 are independent schools. Majuba said all exam centres have been classified in terms of risk profiles, and all high-risk centres will have resident monitors. “Every effort has been made by the department to enhance security in all areas where assessment material is handled. “This is to ensure we once again administer an incident-free examination as it has happened in the past nine years,” he said.
