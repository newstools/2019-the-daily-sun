 A
hateful message from a stranger nearly spoiled actress, Linda Mtoba's weekend
but she quickly bounced back after her fans cheered her up. Mrs Husband, as she's popularly
known said she received a hateful message on Saturday, and it made her cry. She
said she just did not understand how evil someone can be especially who did not
even know her. She revealed it was her fans on Instagram that cheered her
up. She thanked them saying "I'm so appreciative of the love & support that's so freely given to me. Ppls words have healed me & lifted my spirit so much & so many times."
