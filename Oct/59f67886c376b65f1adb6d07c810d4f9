FOR former Kaizer Chiefs defender Tsepo Masilela to end his 16-month match-drought, he needs to get back in shape pretty quickly. Masilela has been training with AmaZulu for close to three weeks now in a bid to revive his football career. The 34-year-old former Bafana Bafana’s powerful full-back still looks far from getting fit. During training with the club midweek, under coach Jozef Vukusic, he was always on the back foot. This is understandable though, for Masilela to be heavy. He was released by Kaizer Chiefs at the end of the 2017/18 season and it’s been almost two seasons without kicking a ball. His last appearance in the Premier Soccer League was with Amakhosi when they lost 3-1 to then Clinton Larsen’s Golden Arrows side at the Princess Magogo Stadium on 24 April last year. “With Tsepo, we need more time because he didn’t play for a very long time,” said Usuthu coach Vukusic. “But he’s training well and that makes me happy. But he needs two or three weeks and we’ll see. Hopefully, by then he’ll be fine.” The aim from AmaZulu is to sign Masilela as they are short at the left-back position as rising star Sibusiso Mabiliso is out with foot injury. He won’t play any matches this year. That leaves Usuthu stretched in that department and may rush to sign Masilela. Masilela, who has won two league titles, one Nedbank Cup and MTN8 trophies, should take courage in the fact that he may get a contract. Defender Mario Booysen, another player who was assessed by the Durban-based club, has been signed on a two-year deal. He too was released by Chiefs at the end last season.
