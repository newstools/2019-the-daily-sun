Former
president Jacob Zuma's trial has been postponed to 4 February 2020. This after
his defense team announced that Zuma is appealing Friday's court decision to
dismiss his application to have his case struck off the roll. His lawyer
Thabani Masuku said his client is appealing the decision. State
prosecutor Billy Downer was ready for trial but will now have to wait due Zuma filing
the appeal. Judge
Charmaine Bulton said Zuma's team will have to file by 1 November then come
back for arguments on his appeal. She said
the trial will begin on 4 February next year. The scene in and outside court was set with senior and ordinary ANC members slowly arriving. Former deputy legislature speaker Meshack Radebe, Radical Economic Transformation leader Nkosentsha Shezi, inkosi Mandla Matu from Eastern Cape were the first to arrive in court to support Zuma. On Friday, Judges Thoba Poyo-Dlwati, Bhekisisa Mnguni and Esther Steyn delivered their ruling in the matter.  In the criminal case against him, Zuma faces charges of fraud, money laundering, racketeering and corruption which relate to alleged bribes paid to him by French arms company Thales â€“ one of the successful contractors in the multibillion-rand arms deal.  But, he wanted the court to grant him a stay of prosecution, effectively making him immune to the charges. Thales, his co-accused in the matter which faces charges of money laundering, corruption and racketeering, has asked for a similar relief.
