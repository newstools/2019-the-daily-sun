Millions of poor children around the world don't have shoes and Kenton Lee has found a solution to reduce these numbers. After his stay in Kenya seeing that so many children walked barefoot or were wearing shoes that don't fit, Kenton decided to invent the shoe that grows.  These sandals were created to grow with the child as you are able to adjust their size, allowing underprivileged children to grow up never having to be without footwear. According to BuzzFeed, The Shoe That Grows started when Kenton Lee was on his way to church and he noticed a little girl in a white dress next to him who had shoes that were way too small for her feet. That led to many questions with Kenton asking why and shortly after, The Shoe That Grows was born.  You can visit Keaton Lee's website here.
