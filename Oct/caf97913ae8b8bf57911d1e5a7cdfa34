The elegant doo will be held at Steyn City, north of Jozi on 16 November. Standard Bank is the main sponsor. Director and founder of the Standard Bank Polo in the Park, Anina Malherbe-Lan, said the theme is “Polo through the Ages”. “The theme aims to showcase the countries that polo first became famous in,” she said. “These include Persia, where it all started 2 000 years ago, Shanghai, Jaipur, Barcelona and Buenos Aires. “Park Polo is usually played in Los Angeles, Miami, London and Dubai, among other places.” According to Anina, the event will be the most spectacular in Mzansi this year. “The polo event is not only about the sport but will be a place for fashionistas and music lovers to have fun in the sun,” she said. “There’ll be an Art Pop-Up Gallery, Bulgari Jewellery Lounge, luxury fashion emporium which includes sunglasses by Freckle Eyewear and a showcase by Sandton City’s Diamond Walk, a luxury car showcase, jazz and hip hop performances,” she said. A special polo field has been built for the event. Anina said the game would be slightly different this time around. “It’s a very fast form of action polo. “Therefore, it’s incredibly exciting, action-packed and fun to watch. “The rules have been tweaked here and there to make it faster and bring spectators closer to the action by way of an arena-style polo playing field.” According to Anina, Steyn City was tasked with building the arena and playing field for this event from scratch.
