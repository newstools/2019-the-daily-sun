BAFANA BAFANA players took time out of their busy schedule to pay a visit to the Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital in Parktown, Johannesburg yesterday. The visit was part of the 25 anniversary celebration of the partnership between SAFA and the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund. The players were taken on a tour of the state of the art, specialised pediatric facility for children. They signed autographs and posed for pictures with the children, who were excited to finally meet some of their heroes in person. The players were equally in awe of the children, whose positivity and beaming smiles despite fighting life-threatening illnesses, was a source of inspiration to most of the players. Bafana striker, Kermit Erasmus, who is a father of two little girls himself, said the visit to the hospital was “a bit of an emotional experience.” “Seeing terminally ill children is sad, but I guess it’s part of life,” said Erasmus. “We try to be positive for them and give them a bit of hope, try to put a smile on their faces.” Midfielder Lebohang Phiri said it was an honour to interact with the children and is looking forward to more visits in the future. “First of all, it’s a great achievement for us as a country to have such a home for the kids where they can be taken care of,” said Phiri. “For us as players, it’ an honour to be here to try and give back to the next generation and inspire them to get back to full health as soon as possible. “Of course I believe in such initiatives and hopefully we can do more of such visits in the future to give back, not only when we are on international duty, but when we have time as individuals.”
