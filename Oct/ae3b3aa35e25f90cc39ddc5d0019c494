CAPE Town City want to use the Telkom Knockout Cup competition to turn around their fortunes. Since the season started The Citizens have been struggling to get results winning only one of their nine matches in all competitions. They were knocked out in the first round of the MTN8 by Polokwane City. Another first-round elimination in the TKO this weekend when they host on-form Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday at Cape Town Stadium (3pm) will put coach Benni McCarthy under immense pressure. It has always been said that for such big games players need no motivation when they play the likes of Chiefs, Mamelodi Sundowns as well as Orlando Pirates, and coach McCarthy attests to that and hoping his players will rise to the occasion. He told the reporters during media open day in Cape Town: “For every player, there’s not a lot of motivation needed for this clash. “This time around Chiefs are the favourites. I hope the players will relish this big occasion for everybody.” He continued: “The form that they (Chiefs) are in at this moment they are the team to beat. “Our players have a lot to make it right. “A game like this when you get a positive result and a passage into the next round can change everything. At the same time, it can mislead people because everybody raises their levels when you play the bigger teams. “After Chiefs who comes next? Maritzburg United and then you drop from being top of the mountain. Let’s hope we won’t drop after this game.” City’s major problem has been their leaky defence which has conceded more goals more than any team in the league. City could go into this encounter without key defender and captain Thamsanqa Mkhize and Keanu Cupido who came back from national team duties with injuries. Mkhize was withdrawn from the Bafana Bafana squad due to injury while Cupido returned from Egypt on Tuesday with SA Under-23 said injured.
