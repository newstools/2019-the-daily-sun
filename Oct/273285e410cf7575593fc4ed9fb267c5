MAMELODI Sundowns have confirmed that they will be moving all their home matches, from 23 October to 9 May next year, to Loftus Stadium for the remainder of the 2019-20 PSL season. The Brazilians have been sharing Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville with newly crowned MTN8 champions, SuperSport United, but looks like their Chloorkop neighbours have found a new home. They were due to host Highlands Park on 23 October in Atteridgeville but that has been switched to Loftus Stadium, as well all their home matches from now on until 9 May next year. It remains unclear whether would still be using Lucas Moripe Stadium for their Caf Champions League, as the venue has been registered as their home venue with the governing African football body. Sundowns will on Saturday share the field with Kaizer Chiefs in the Shell Helix Ultra Cup at the FNB Stadium at 4pm.
