Gay and lesbian kids deserve respect but all too often face discrimination and harassment at school. There’s still a lot to be done to ensure equal treatment at schools. Bullying of these pupils should be prevented and they need support to live better lives. All pupils should live, learn, grow and play safely at their schools. Gay and lesbian pupils have rights, and the Constitution recognises that all pupils are equal. Discrimination against pupils based on gender is unconstitutional and seriously affects their learning and achievements. It should never be allowed. Every pupil should be free to express themselves according to their gender and sexual orientation. Parents mustn’t allow gay and lesbian pupils to be discriminated against, and kids who abuse them at school should be punished. It’s important for parents to work with teachers by teaching their children not to discriminate. Respect gay and lesbian pupils’ choices and rights. - Letter from Slight Ramphaka in Florida.
