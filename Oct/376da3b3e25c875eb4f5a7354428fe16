The third annual Dance Music Awards South Africa took place at Birchwood Hotel in Ekurhuleni. The awards saw Mzansi talents take home what they deserved last night but most people feel Msaki deserved more. Msaki's loyal fans were not happy that she wasn’t mentioned during the acceptance speech of the current hit song 'Fetch your Life' that she made with Local DJ Prince Kaybee. The fans took to Twitter to share their grievances saying that she deserved to be mentioned as the song won Best House Record at the ceremony. Poople were not impressed with how Prince Kaybee and his team handled the whole situation on acknowledging her for the hard work she has put in. The producer took to Twitter and shared a long message saying he would like to apologize on behalf of his booking manager. He shared that he collected the award without mentioning her name.
