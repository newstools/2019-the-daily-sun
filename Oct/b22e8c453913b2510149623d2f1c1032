THE kids saw a man poking a pig and ran to tell the owner. But when the owner told the man to stop he refused and carried on without missing a beat. Even when his father was called, the poking man wouldn’t stop and the cops were called.  On Monday, cops in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State, removed the 39-year-old man from Chris Hani Park. Facebook came alive with comments when the post was shared. Moeketsi Maximilano said: “He was afraid of women so he chose to poke a pig.” Pulane Peggy said the man did nothing wrong. “I could bail him out because he didn’t go to the kids,” he said. Julia Majuli said: “How are we going to eat that meat?” Witness Lehlonolo Mosikili said the man claimed it was his pig. Bloemfontein SPCA manager Reinet Meyer said bestiality is barbaric. “It’s totally against the law. If anyone witnesses such an incident, they must take a video and go to the nearest police station to report the incident and contact their nearest SPCA,” she said. “Such acts have a big impact on the emotional and physical well-being of the animal.” She said the sentence is normally a fine of R4 000 or 12 months imprisonment. Police spokesman Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said police had to forcibly remove the man from the pig. Mophiring told Daily Sun: “He’ll appear in court on a charge of bestiality. “He was reprimanded by the owner of the animal and his father. “But he refused to let go of the pig until police removed him and detained him.” Mophiring said the pig was still with the owner. The court would decide if the suspect should be taken for mental evaluation. The suspect appeared in the Phuthaditjhaba Magistrates Court. Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said the case was postponed until 18 November. “The suspect is still behind bars,” said Mophiring.
