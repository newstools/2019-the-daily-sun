IT HAS become a norm for younger men to date older women. But they’re not in it for love. It’s a career. This is according to relationship and seduction expert Mandisa O Mahlobo-Ferro. She gave the SunTeam insight into her fifth book, The Relationship Bible, to be launched on Saturday. “Ben 10s are recipients and it’s their career. “They only bring their 4-5s in the relationship, and the woman brings the wallet. This is because they’re both desperate.” The book talks about various relationship topics and about the power of seduction. She said side chicks wanted to become main chicks. “They want the man to divorce the wife and marry them, while others want to be accepted by the wife. “They’re also prepared to be in a polygamous relationship because things are still working out well for them.” She said she’d been insulted by feminists and men, but she was only trying to change things. “I don’t judge my clients and I’m not a dictator. “I listen to their needs as well as their desires and coach them by stating realities which they have overlooked.”
