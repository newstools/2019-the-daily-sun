COLONEL Dhanajaya Naidoo has been in witness protection for eight years without testifying against anyone. The former crime intelligence clerk yesterday told the Zondo Commission he had no idea why he had not been called, despite having made 11 affidavits to the Hawks. He said senior investigator Kobus Roelofse told him he was struggling to get the documents declassified.  He said when he was KZN transport MEC, Police Minister Bheki Cele was involved in awarding tenders to Durban businessman Timmy Marimuthu. Naidoo said he once met Cele at Marimuthu’s house in Umhlanga, where Cele was allegedly offered a R40 000 bribe. He said while they were waiting for Cele to arrive, former head of the secret service slush fund Major-General Solomon Lazarus called a crime intelligence official to organise the cash.

He said he believed the money was for Cele, because the call to organise cash was made just before he arrived. Zondo warned him against making too many assumptions as he didn’t know if Cele took the money for sure. Naidoo also said Tiso Blackstar senior journalist Ranjeni Munusamy also received money from crime intelligence. He said in 2008, he was told by former commissioner Mulangi Mphego to help Munusamy with repairs to her BMW convertible, which cost R40 000.
