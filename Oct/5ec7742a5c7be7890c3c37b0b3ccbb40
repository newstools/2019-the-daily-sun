RESIDENTS want the City of Cape Town to allow them to move into their new homes, even though there is no electricity. Beneficiaries of the Nyanga Housing Project said they were tired of waiting. But they can’t move in as the city told them there were delays with the installation of electricity. However, Mashiya Majozi (72) told Daily Sun they didn’t care if there was electricity or not. “We will use candles while they take their time with the electrification. The city must allow us to move into our houses before they are given to the wrong people,” he said. Nyameka Ngqontsela (58) said: “We were supposed to move in two months ago, but the municipality did not say anything about electricity until we asked them. “These delaying tactics are some kind of a strategy. We believe they don’t want to give us our houses anymore. There’ll be war if they think they are going to give them to other people.” MMC for Human Settlements Malusi Booi said the department was making efforts to ensure beneficiaries moved into their homes as soon as possible. “For this reason, we’re working very closely with the contractors to ensure the electrification is done in the shortest possible time,” he said. He said the city would communicate with the beneficiaries in the next few days regarding when they would be able to move into their homes.
