NEWLY appointed Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki is itching to finally get his tenure up and running. He will get his chance to show South Africans what to expect under his stewardship when Bafana host Mali in the 2019 Nelson Mandela Challenge. The match will take place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Bafana assembled for camp in Joburg yesterday and will travel to Port Elizabeth tomorrow where they will begin preparations for the clash. The match will help Ntseki prepare his soldiers for the crucial 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan next month. The former Under-17 national team coach knows that a good result against the West Africans would give them momentum heading into the back-to-back qualifiers. “It’s a very important match for us because last time we could not have a game,” said Ntseki. “This will be more of a dress rehearsal, preparing to go into the two Afcon qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan. “We need to have the camp and be able to establish our tactical approach heading into those matches.” Ntseki, who replaced Stuart Baxter last month, will now be looking to put his own stamp on the Bafana team. He has recalled the likes of Lebohang Phiri, Eric Mathoho and Kermit Erasmus, all of whom had seen their opportunities in the national team set-up limited under Baxter. However, Ntseki will most likely build his team around stars such as Percy Tau, Lebo Mothiba, Themba Zwane and Bongani Zungu. “It is not necessarily about Mali but more about us having that identity as Bafana Bafana and having that tactical preparation ahead of a crucial away match against Ghana and also our home match against Sudan,” added Ntseki. “We know for a fact that playing Ghana away will be tough, but Sudan here at home will be tougher because the pressure will be on us to deliver at home in front of our supporters. So we want to use the Mali match to get the boys ready for the sterner test that lies ahead.”
