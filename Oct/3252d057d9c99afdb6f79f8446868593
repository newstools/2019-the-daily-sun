Lauren was born with two vaginas and now has 'miracle' twins, Maya and Evie. Mirror reports that Lauren Cotter had suffered from agonising menstrual cramps since she was 15 and was convinced she had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal condition affecting the way the ovaries work. Ultrasound scan a year later revealed she actually had uterus didelphys, where a woman is born with two uteruses, two cervixes and, in her case, two vaginas. According to the World Health Organisation, the condition affects around one in 3,000 women and occurs when the uterus fails to fuse properly during development in the womb.  Lauren says that her condition has never affected her sex life with her husband, Ben but she was told she would find it very hard to carry and deliver a child because of the reduced size of her wombs and cervix. Lauren gave birth to 2 children before the twinsÂ who were conceived despite her being fitted with a contraceptive implant.
