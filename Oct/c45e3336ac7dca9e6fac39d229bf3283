Phindavele grade 11 pupil Busisiwe Mkhwanazi (17) said she would be more confident as no one would make fun of her uniform anymore. “I believe this donation came at the right time as I will be doing an important grade which needs me to have confidence,” she said. “I am grateful because no one at home works and I was not going to get a new uniform next year as my parents have only managed to save for textbooks.” Zwanani Gumede (18) said her new uniform would help her improve her marks as she would look more presentable. Phindavele principal Nkosinathi Cele said he was confident the donation would help boost the pass rate.
