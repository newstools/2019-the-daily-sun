GOALS, VICTORIES, DISCIPLINE and COMMITMENT are some of the things that new Black Leopards recruit Edwin Gyimah has promised his coach Luc Eymael. That is his way of thanking the Belgian for the faith he has shown in him. "I am forever ready to play if the coach calls me," he said. The Ghanaian international signed a season long contract with Leopards, having spent months training alone. The former Orlando Pirates midfielder says he has been inactive for long, but he is ready to bring some spark to Thohoyandou. "The coach needs our support as players, and the best way is to win matches," he said, while sharing the club's ambition. "I am so happy to have finally signed," said Gyimah. "It has been a frustrating time for me sitting at home without a team. I am so thankful to Leopards. I am ready to work hard and show Leopards that they did not make a mistake by signing me. I am here to add value." About Leopards and Venda, the 28-year-old said: "I am already feeling at home. "I got a warm welcome from the players and technical team," he said. "What makes it more easier for me to settle fast is because I have played with the likes of Thuso Phala at SuperSport United and Thabo Matlaba at Orlando Pirates. I am looking forward to working with them again." Gyimah said he is optimistic that Leopards will not fight for relegation this season. "I am impressed with the quality in the team, and the commitment the lads are displaying at training," said the Ghanaian international. "We are going to achieve a lot under coach Eymael. We also have our fans who are always behind us. So I see an exciting season for us and our fans." Gyimah, who was released by Bidvest Wits at the end of last season, said he is fit and ready to play when Leopards face his former team, SuperSport United, Friday at Lucas Moripe Stadium (7:30pm).
