TWENTY three years after his death,Tupac Shakur was arrested last Friday in the US.But it wasn't the famous rapper who pulled out a knife on cops and was bust for drug possession.CNN reports that cops  in Tennessee arrested a man named Tupac A. Shakur, 40, after they say he pulled a knife on them and was found with the drug known as meth. This Tupac had previous run-ins with the law similar to the late rapper and had warrants out for his arrest.Also just like the iconic rapper who was shot and later died in 1996 whose second name was Amaru,the 40 year-old suspect's second name also starts with an A. He was charged with aggravated assault,  meth possession and having unlawful drug paraphernalia. He is being held at the Washington County Detention Center on  $18,000 bail (about R265 00).
