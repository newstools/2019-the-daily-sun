THE football supporters who caused all the mayhem and mess at the Moses Mabhida Stadium last year, during the Nedbank Cup semi-final between Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars, will face their demons, but in a different way. This time around, the corrected hooligans, are being used to spread the word against stadium hooliganism, or any form of crime. Damage worth millions of rands was caused at the stadium, where SuperSport TV cameras and sound systems were being broken. The Department of Justice together with the Premier Soccer League, member clubs, league sponsors and the City of eThekwini will on Tuesday hold a victim offenders mediation dialogue at Durban's Moses Mabhida Stadium. This will be attended by the eight supporters who were arrested in May 2018 during the Nedbank Cup semi-final fixture between Kaizer Chiefs and Free State Stars at Moses Mabhida Stadium. The eight were convicted of various crimes following acts of hooliganism on the night resulting in extensive damage to stadium property and to that of broadcasters, SuperSport. Now the eight offenders want to make amends and spread a message against stadium hooliganism and public violence through the Correctional Services Victim Offender Mediation Dialogue.
