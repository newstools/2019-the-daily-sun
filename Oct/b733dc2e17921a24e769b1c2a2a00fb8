FORMER Ukhozi FM DJ Ngizwe Mchunu is involved in a war of words with well-known KZN inyanga, Dr 3 Seconds. The two have even threatened to beat each other if they met. Dr 3 Seconds accused Mchunu of making fun of him on his online radio station on Saturday while he was interviewing maskandi artist Mjaheni. Dr 3 Seconds claimed Mchunu accused him of interfering in maskandi battles. Dr 3 Seconds, whose clients included Mshoza and Kenny Kunene, accused Mchunu of disrespecting him. “I’m a professor and he’s not on my level. I’ve already reported him to my ancestors and he’ll never be a success in life,” he said. “That spaza shop he calls Ngizwe Mchunu FM Radio will soon disappear. “I will give him a hot klap because he’s too young. I won’t box with him. I’d kill him. “He must stop interfering in maskandi music and focus on his radio presenting.” Mchunu, who’s also a sangoma, said he wasn’t scared of Dr 3 Seconds’ muthi or a physical fight. “I’m also a sangoma and I know how to use muthi. I’m in my forest collecting herbs to make my muthi stronger. He must stay away from maskandi and focus on being an inyanga,” he said. “I’ve invited him to my radio station to give him a right of reply. I’m also inviting him to my festival at Curries Fountain in Durban next month. I want to embarrass him in front of people.” Dr 3 Seconds said he won’t attend because he and Mchunu were not on the same level.
