 SEVERAL families will not have to worry about what they will
eat this evening. This is because they received food parcels today. The donations were from Mojos Foundation founder Sibusiso
Khumalo together with international DJ Ralf Gum. Before the two handed over the food parcels they first
served the families some food to eat while the parcels were being prepared for
them and the families. Speaking to Daily Sun before handing over the food
parcel DJ Ralf Gum said he often gets invited to play music at Mojos for these
residents and so being part of this initiative of giving back to them means a
lot to him. "These people come to listen to our music, and this is
how we thank them," he said. Sibusiso Khumalo said it’s important to give back to the
people that support you. "70 families will not worry about what they will eat as
we gave them food. Although the foundation has given back to the residents before,
but this is the first time we are doing this with DJ Ralf," he said. He said they are happy to have been able to make a
difference in people's lives. A resident who received the groceries Zinhle Mthimkhulu (45)
said: "I'm so grateful. I didn’t even have salt and I had to cook without
it, because I didn’t have money to buy it, but today I got it. “This is really big for me. I can’t wait to get home and
cook a nice meal for my five children," she said. Mpume Shabalala (35) said she often goes to Mojos with
friends but today she went for a different reason which was to receive free
groceries and eat for free. "This shows that management at Mojos cares about
us," she said.
