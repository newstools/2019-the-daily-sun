THE ANC’s Joburg caucus opened criminal charges against mayor Herman Mashaba and an accounting officer. The charges relate to an alleged illegal fleet contracts worth R3 billion by the City of Joburg. Eunice Mgcina, chief whip of the caucus, said they believed the tender process was fraudulent. “We believe opening charges will eventually expose them for what they’ve done since September 2018.” Councillor Cathy Seefort opened the case at Hillbrow cop shop on Friday. She said the tender dealt with the city’s fleet finances. “The tender was given to a certain company, but the mayor chose to use regulation 32, which is a diversion from the recommendation.”  She said Mashaba gave the tender to a company of his choice. Mayoral spokesman Tony Taverna-Turisan said this was a cheap political stunt to try and discredit Mashaba. “The ANC is well aware this fleet contract was subject to a full forensic investigation which was followed by an external legal opinion. These found the process followed was lawful. “Mashaba was cleared of any political interference,” he said. Mashaba said on Twitter: “The only thing remarkable about ANC laying charges against me is they’re going to present their case outside the police station, and not locked inside.”
