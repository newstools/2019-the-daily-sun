IT IS a corner house with a big yard and many people wish to own it. But buyers claimed to be chased away by a ghost the minute they stepped inside. The owner burnt to death inside the house three years ago, and people say the man’s family never came to fetch his spirit.  Residents of Mapetla in Soweto are now appealing to the family to cleanse the house and collect his spirit. They claimed they heard screams at night and banging sounds coming from the house. “We’ve never seen anyone coming here since the man died,” said Seun Mofere. Resident Miranda Mbele said nyaope boys smoke outside the house but won’t sleep in it. “It clearly shows there’s something going on in that house,” she said. GHOST HOUSE NIGHTMARE! She said residents also wanted to demolish the house as thugs hid there to rob people walking past. Other residents told Daily Sun they were afraid to walk past the house at night as they heard screams. Would-be buyer Shirley Ndaba said: “I went there to view it, but there was some spirit I couldn’t explain. There’s a bad vibe in that house.” Another interested buyer, Boitumelo Lefakane, said she loved the house’s big yard but got the shivers the moment she stepped inside. The SunTeam inspected the house and the burn marks were still visible and the ceiling was coming apart. When the team entered the house, it was very cold yet it was hot outside. Councillor Mirriam Maleke said they’d have to check who owned the house and trace his relatives. SunReaders who know the owner’s family can call 011 877 6060.
