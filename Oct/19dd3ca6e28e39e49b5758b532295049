TWITTER nearly came to a standstill on Friday after Khanyi Mbau posted a provocative picture of herself. The image triggered pregnancy rumours. In the picture, the award-winning actress is seen showing her belly. And behind her is an ultrasound scanner. Read Khanyi’s caption to the image: “Every performance deserves an award.” And these words sent Twitter into a rumour mill frenzy. But Khanyi later stated she wasn’t pregnant. She said the caption was to celebrate her acting award for that scene in the movie, Red Room. Explained Khanyi to the People’s Paper yesterday: “This was meant for a specific scene in a movie I’m shooting. If I was pregnant, this isn’t the way I would announce it. “But maybe one day those who wish for me to be pregnant may have that wish come to pass. “But right now, I’m focusing on my career and a baby is the last thing on my mind.” Read her response tweet: SPYROS I AM NOT PREGNANT! I won Best Actress Award for that scene. Thank you. Got the love, but no babies.
