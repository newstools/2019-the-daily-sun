Hey MizzB I am 22 years old and have a child with my boyfriend of five years. I’ve never been slender, but since the birth of my son I’ve gained a lot of weight, most of it around my stomach. My boyfriend tells me I look like an elephant and is no longer attracted to me. When I post pictures on social media, he removes his name from the post. I use pills to lose weight so I can gain his love again. I hate the woman I see in the mirror. Please help! Hey Lady Talking negatively about another person is easier than facing our own flaws as people. When someone genuinely loves you, it shouldn’t just be words. It should be visible in their actions and in the manner in which they treat you. Don’t waste your energy trying to change your body for someone other than yourself!
