 A 79 year old man murdered at least 50 people,making him the most prolific serial killer in US history, the FBI said. According to the FBI, Samuel Little confessed to 93 homicides – mostly of women – between 1970 and 2005. Although investigators have only confirmed his involvement in 50 of them, they believe all of Little’s confessions are credible. The FBI has set up a website showing his videotaped recollections of unidentified killings, alongside sketches – drawn by Little – of the people he claims to have murdered. “Many of his victims’ deaths, however, were originally ruled overdoses or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found,” the FBI wrote on the website. He was jailed for life in 2014 after being convicted of three murders. “For many years, Little believed he’d not be caught because he thought no one was accounting for his victims,” FBI crime analyst Christie Palazzolo said. “Even though he’s already in prison, the FBI believes it’s important to seek justice for each victim – to close every case possible.” – NEWS24
