Drake’s dad, Dennis Graham claims he was always present in the rapper’s life. Drake whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham usually raps about his absent father, but the dad has come out to say it’s not true. Dennis who is a R&B and soul singer was in an interview with Nick Cannon on his radio show on Monday. Nick asked him about the ups and downs of his relationship with Drake. Dennis answered: “I had a conversation with Drake about that. I have always been with Drake. I talked to him, if not every day, then every other day. And we got into a deep conversation about that, I said Drake why are you saying all these things about me, this is not cool, he said dad it sells records and I said okay, we’re cool.” Drake then responded to the claims via Instagram status on Tuesday, saying his dad is lying and would say anything to people who are willing to listen to him. “Woke up today so hurt man. My father will say anything to anyone that’s willing to listen to him. It’s sad when family gets like this but what can we really do that’s the people we are stuck with… every bar that I ever spit was the truth and the truth is hard for some people to accept.”
