THE court yesterday heard that convicted Dros rapist, Nicholas Ninow would be a danger to society if he didn’t stop abusing drugs and alcohol. Appearing in the North Gauteng High Court, Tshwane, for pre-sentencing, Ninow took to the stand to testify for mitigation of his sentencing.   He told the court what he did to the victim was not personal as he was high on drugs. He said if he was sober, he would not think of harming a child. Ninow said when the incident happened, he had been high for three days. “When I arrived at the restaurant, I was already high on CAT and I consumed a lot of alcohol. When I raped the girl, I didn’t think about the consequences. I was just numb and angry. I only became regretful later on,” he said. Ninow told the court he started smoking dagga when he was 12 and started using harder drugs when he was 13. “My first encounter with drugs was with my mom,” he said. He admitted to using drugs while in prison and having suicidal thoughts but said he would be a good person if given a second chance. Psychologist Marina Genis, arguing for a lighter sentence, said Ninow grew up in an environment where his mother and grandfather were drug addicts. She said if he didn’t undergo rehabilitation treatment, he was likely to offend again. Probation officer, Dete Kelder recommended that Ninow be handed down a life sentence for rape. His grandmother, Pauline Gereck said when Ninow was high, he was a bad person but he was good when he was sober. The case was postponed to tomorrow.
