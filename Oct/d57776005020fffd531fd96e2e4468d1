A 75-year-old gogo may have become the world's oldest mother. The unidentified pensioner, who is said to have been desperate for a child of her own after adopting, gave birth by Caesarean section to a daughter at a private hospital in Kota, Rajasthan, on Saturday night. Her girl, who weighed just 1lb 5oz (0.59KG), was rushed straight into intensive care and given life support. According to the Daily Mail She had to be delivered prematurely through a Caesarean section after just six-and-a-half months of pregnancy because her elderly mother, who has only one working lung, was physically weak. It is not clear if the pensioner - who had already gone through the menopause - has a husband or if she used donor sperm. It is also unclear whether she used donor eggs or had her eggs frozen decades ago. If the mother is as old as she claims, it will make her nine years older than the current record holder.
