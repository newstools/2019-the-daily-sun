TRADE and Industry Deputy Minister Nomalungelo Gina visited Botshabelo Industrial Park on Tuesday to ensure locals had jobs. During her visit, she promised residents of the Mangaung kasi jobs. Gina was accompanied by Economic Development MEC Makalo Mohale and Premier Sisi Ntombela. She said the industrial park was part of a programme aimed at fast-tracking economic development by attracting investment to the area. “This is one of the largest industrial parks in Mzansi, and the department and provincial government have pumped a lot of money into its revitalisation,” she said. “It’s close to where people live, close to the kasi. “I’m happy because that means job opportunities are going to be created for Botshabelo residents.” Mohale said government wanted investors to open factories in the area. “We’ve invested a total of R65 million, and for the first phase have spent R24 million. “The second phase has R41 million allocated to it. We’re just here to feel what’s happening and witness our work, and we’re pleased.” The premier said creating jobs was important as the unemployment rate in the Free State was worrying. “The owners of the factories must make things happen,” said Mohale. “We can’t wait for five years. “I want action now and to employ 200 or 500 people will be a blessing.”
