THE BOJANALA Platinum District Municipality
employees demand their salaries again. They threw rubbish and burnt tyres on Thursday
inside the municipal building. The workers went on strike since July 2019 after
not receiving their salaries. The last meeting held by the municipal workers and management
they were told there is no money in the Bojanala account. But workers say there is a R134 million that was
deposited into the account. Employee Pule Lekotloane (48) is still waiting to
be paid, he said the municipality is frustrating them. The salaries are either late, paid half or nothing
at all. July salaries were paid on 03 August, August
salaries were paid on 07 September and its currently mid-October no payments
have been made for September. "When we spoke to the mayor in a meeting a
week ago, she said thereâ€™s no money in the account. But lower income employees
were paid their salaries. Others received half of their salaries. Bear in mind
that we have families to feed," he said. Municipal Spokesman Archie Babeile said the workers
were told of the coming financial challenges. He said the R134 million demanded by the workers
was an error deposit into the municipal account. "The R134 million was erroneously paid into
our account from the Provincial Human Settlement department. We cannot
determine how that error happened. We used part of the money and at a later
stage when we were requested to return it and we had already used about R84
million." Babeile said the municipality relies on equitable
shares paid to them by the Provincial Treasury office. The striking workers said there will be no work
until they get paid.
