MUM, I’m dying, go help Mark! These were the last words Jabhile Mokoena’s son said to her before he died. Jabhile’s sons Trevor (39) and Mark Hlatswayo (37) were shot by hijackers in Wattville, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday. The hijackers wanted to take Mark’s Golf Chicco and fled on foot after they failed to take it.  Trevor died on the spot, while Mark died two days later in hospital. Jabhile told Daily Sun her sons were sitting outside when they were attacked. “Trevor left to put on long trousers. I then heard Mark argue with some people. “His brother went to find out what was happening and was shot in the stomach,” she said. She said Mark was shot in his car and was taken to hospital, while Trevor died at the scene. READ: FROM CASHIER TO OWNER! “I’m so devastated. I can’t explain the pain I’m feeling. I hoped they would bury me, but now it’s the other way round,” said Jabhile. Residents said their township was terrorised by hijackers. They claim about 18 cars have been hijacked since the beginning of this year. They blamed Actonville police for not doing enough. Police spokesman Captain Pheelo Mothapo said a double case of murder was opened at Actonville Police Station.
