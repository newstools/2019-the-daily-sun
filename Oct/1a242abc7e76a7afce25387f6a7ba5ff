ACTOR Sisanda Henna is asought-after man. But he’s not wanted for his acting exploits, rather for owing the bank money. Standard Bank took Sisanda to court after he had failed to pay the monthly instalments for the money he used on his credit card. According to court papers, the actor owes the bank more than R55 000. The bank enlisted the services of debt collectors, MBD Legal Collections, who in turn went to the Joburg Civil court to obtain summons against the star. According to the summons issued on 5 August, the lender wants their money back paid in full with 10% interest.  The bank is demanding an amount of R55 467,35 from Sisanda. Reads the summons, in part: “The defendant breached the terms of the agreement by failing to make payments of the instalment(s) to SBSA.” After numerous attempts to contact Sisanda, the bank handed the account over to debt collectors. Read the summons: “On 1 May, the Standard Bank of South Africa and with its principal place of business situated at 19th floor, Life Centre Building, 45 Commissioner Street, Joburg, sold all the rights, title, interest and benefit and plaintiff, by virtue of sale and cession of the book of debts, which included the defendant’s account to MBD Legal collections.” According to the summons, dated June 2019, Sisanda had failed to settle his account despite the bank’s many attempts to get him to do so. “As a result of the aforesaid breach and cession, the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of R55 467.35 and despite due and proper demand, the defendant has failed and/or refused to pay the outstanding balance.” Sisanda refused to comment about the matter.
