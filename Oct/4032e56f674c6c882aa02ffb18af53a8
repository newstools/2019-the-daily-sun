GATVOL of thugs doing as they pleased, people took matters into their own hands. Eventually, Pennyville and Noordgesig residents fought in the streets! Pennyville community leader Patrick Jafta told Daily Sun: “Police are failing us. Women who don’t have husbands live in fear.” He said the protest was sparked by threats that Noordgesig residents didn’t want to see Pennyville kids going to school or adults to the clinic or Shoprite between the two kasis.  Two suspects were beaten to death while one ran away. “The situation between the two areas is tense. Our kids are afraid to go to school and nine of our residents are behind bars. We opened cases but nothing happens.” A madala said his house was in a mess after Noordgesig residents retaliated following the deaths of two locals. “They even broke my geyser,” said the madala.  Captain Kay Makhubele said Pennyville residents protested because their kids were threatened. “They claim Noordgesig threatened to harm their kids after a mob justice attack. “So they stayed off work to make sure kids were safe. No arrests have been made and no one was hurt.”
