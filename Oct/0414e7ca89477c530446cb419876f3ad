A SCHOOL in Emalahleni was broken into on Wednesday afternoon and equipment worth about millions stolen. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said about 15 suspects wearing balaclavas overpowered security guards. The thugs gained access to Tambo Maths, Science and Technology Academy’s server room after
  breaking down doors. Zwane said the thugs stole cameras, computers and monitors. “This happened when the department had scheduled a celebration on Monday to mark five years since the academy was established,” Zwane told the People’s Paper. He said the damage was estimated at about R3,5 million. Emalahleni police spokesman Sergeant David Ratau said a business robbery case was opened and no arrests had been made. Investigations were continuing. The academy was opened in 2017 by then education MEC Reginah Mhaule.
