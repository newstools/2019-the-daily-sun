THE family is still in pain after losing two family members in a shack fire. But they now have to live with the bones of their loved ones. PICS: PASTOR SERVES PIG SKOP AS HOLY COMMUNION! Jimmy Chauke (61) and his son, Michael (12), burnt to death in their shack in Mamelodi East extension 11, Tshwane, last Tuesday. Jimmy’s other son, Kagiso (22), said they picked up the bones while they were cleaning rubble in the burnt nine-roomed shack last Wednesday. He said the bones were left behind by forensic pathologists when they took the bodies. “We can’t tell whose bones are whose. But the bones belong to them.” He said they called police to take the bones, but they never came. Jimmy’s wife, Esther (52), told Daily Sun she couldn’t look at her husband and son’s bones. “I can’t sleep at night as I remember them. Living with their bones is very traumatic,” she said. The family said they would bury the bones with the rest of the bodies if cops don’t take them. The family lost everything in the fire including four IDs, six birth certificates, R5 000, bank cards, school certificates and Christmas clothes. They appealed for any donations including food, a mobile toilet, school uniforms and a shack.  Mamelodi West police spokesman, Captain Johannes Maheso said police were informed about the bones. He said the scene would be revisited and other remains would be taken to forensics.
