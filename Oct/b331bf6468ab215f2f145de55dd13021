CURVES or no curves, that’s the question on most men’s minds among the qualities they look for when picking their partners. And data confirms the stronger sex is attracted to members of the fairer sex with a shapely and curvy waist. A 2017 Fit Rated study about men’s physical preferences in their partners found they were easily drawn to curvaceous women. But what do men perceive as “curvy”? The informal definition boils down to a woman with big bums, flat stomach, perky breasts and thick rounded thighs. According to Sibulelo Dlamini, he only dates curvy women because they turn him on and tend to have a great personality. Said Sibulelo: “When it comes to women, I only date thick women because they fascinate me. “Also, I seem to only fall for thick women. I don’t have a problem with thin women, but they kind of seem like men with boobs sometimes, which is a turn off.” Sibulelo said his experience had showed him thick women outperformed skinny girls in the bedroom. “Thick women’s confidence is really what I’m attracted to more than anything else,” said Sibulelo. “I think sometimes it’s not about the curves but the person they are on the inside. “This as most curvy women tend to be an open book and are good at expressing their feelings, which is what men are attracted to.” But Thabo Cele said there’s nothing special about bums because, at the end of the day, everyone has them. Explained Thabo: “I can’t be fascinated by a big booty, breasts or curves because they aren’t even real these days. “I don’t even partake in those kinds of discussions because they’re all about satisfying someone’s sexual fantasies. Also, guys end up showing how perverted they are. “I prefer a woman who makes me happy. That means she’s willing to make me happy in bed. In the end, bums and breasts have no significant role. At best, they’re just a decoration.”
