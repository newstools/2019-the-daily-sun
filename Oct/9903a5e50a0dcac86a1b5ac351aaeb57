The news of renowned actress Sophie Ndaba being dead circulated on social media today. And various websites claimed the star has succumbed to her diabetes, which she has been vocal about. However, Daily Sun can reveal that Sophie is alive and healthy. We caught with the star, who told us that she is not moved by all the "social media nonsense". "I'm getting used to the nonsense, it doesn't move me," she said. It's not the first time rumours of her death circulated on social media. In April, a hoax about her death did the rounds and she set the record straight.
