 SWALLOWS FC chairman David Mogashoa has explained to SunSport how he landed Brandon Trutter into their nest. Trutter quit from Richards Bay on Saturday, and the GladAfrica Championship club put a notice on their social media pages, a source where Mogashoa learnt about Trutter’s availability. “I called him and brought him down to Joburg today. And bang, we agreed,” Mogashoa said. “He is an experienced coach with vast knowledge of the NFD.” Trutter’s mandate is to help bring stability to Swallows after Zeca Marques’ stint, which was not successful. Mogashoa said Trutter must ensure they finish the season within the top eight, “and a play-offs position finish would make us happy”. Trutter told SunSport that he is ready for the challenge. “This is a big deal, big brand and I look forward to the job,” he said. Club COO Lukhanyo Mzizi confirmed that their new “international coach” is already in the country. He said the coach will be watching their Absa Premiership match against Bidvest Wits from the stands at Sisa Dukashe Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Mbuyiselo Sambu will be on the bench opposite Gavin Hunt, after Duran Francis was ordered to return to his old job with development teams.
