IT’S important for young people to know where they come from so they know where they are going. Heritage sites are some of the most important avenues through which the youth learn about their origins. SANParks officials took a group of people including the youth on a tour of Mapungubwe in Limpopo at the weekend. The annual tour is aimed at encouraging young people to learn more about their heritage and history. Mapungubwe is one of the most significant historical landmarks in Mzansi. It’s an archaeological area on the border between South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. More than 50 people from Mzansi and other countries took part in the tour. Tour guide and ranger Johannes Mesalasala told Daily Sun young people should not believe everything they read about their ancestors’ origins. He said they should rather give themselves time to visit places such as Mapungubwe to see things for themselves. “Such places help people get in touch with their ancestors. This place is a sacred monument and people should be made aware of it,” Mesalasala said. Chance Masebe-Machete (63), a descendant of the Gwa-Machete royalty, said the history of his people was often misinterpreted. He said he was happy SANParks had dedicated itself to educating people about such significant history. “We’re a lost generation because we have decided to turn our backs on our origins,” he said. “We’ve adapted Western culture to the point where we believe everything they say about our history. “But if government dedicated its time to teaching young people about where they come from, places like Mapungubwe would not be just a historical site but a place where people can reconnect with their ancestors.” Masebe-Machete said Mapungubwe’s history showed that black people had always been capable of doing magnificent things.
