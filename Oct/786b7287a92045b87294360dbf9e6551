President Cyril Ramaphosa says he’s committed to empowering women. He was speaking at the Businesswomen’s Association of South Africa’s presidential dialogue in Joburg today. Issues affecting women and their role in contributing to the economy were at the forefront of the discussion. Ramaphosa said it was essential to place women at the centre of economic activities as equal participants. “We need to have more women-led businesses in manufacturing, and they must participate in our business forums, and trade their goods and services,” he said. The president said the ruling party insisted on gender equality. He urged women to speak up against any form of gender-based violence. “Women must know that their rights are promoted, protected and advanced,” he said. Media mogul Basetsana Kumalo attended the event. She said: “It can’t be that in this day and age, we have not fast-tracked the upward mobility of women in the corporate sector, even though they make up half of the population.” Dr Namane Magau, the association’s former president, said: “We’re happy to see the president acknowledges women.”
