CONSTANCE Randeka is living proof that age is only a number! The 64-year-old gogo recently obtained a national diploma in electrical engineering from Tshwane University of Technology. Constance failed more than three times, but never gave up. She said she dropped out of high school as she had many responsibilities.  “As challenging as it was, I completed my matric in 1998,” she said. She said she applied to study nursing at different universities from 1999 to 2003 with no luck. “I applied to Tshwane University of Technology to study electrical engineering and started in 2003. I struggled with finances from then to 2010. I faced challenges with passing modules due to being in lecture halls with younger students and running a family, but I persevered. “I wanted to prove that even with a painful childhood, one can do anything you put your mind to.”  She wanted to inspire the older generation.“It’s not too late to go back to school. All my kids went to university because I pushed them,” she said.
