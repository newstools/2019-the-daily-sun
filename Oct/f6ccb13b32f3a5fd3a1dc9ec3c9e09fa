A video of a man reportedly
masturbating at a University of Stellenbosch library has surfaced. In the video, the man can
be seen sitting with papers on the desk and his right hand moving under the desk. Following that, it seems
like the staff was notified of the actions of the man and in another video the
man is seen with his hands behind his back. The man was being escorted
out of the library by what appear to be campus security guards. According to News24, the
university confirmed it was aware of the video.  The university said campus
security escorted the man out, at the request of library staff. "He had earlier signed
in as a visitor. The University is investigating the incident as a matter of
urgency," it said in a statement. University of Stellenbosch says
they received an email from a student mentioning that a fellow student had
witnessed the incident, and they are being approached for statements. "While we are working
urgently to confirm all the facts in this case, I want to reassure our students
that their safety is our priority. â€œI also want to repeat the
University's previous statements that we condemn sexual misconduct of any kind,
and are actively working to counter gender-based violence," said the
university's Chief Operating Officer Prof Stan du Plessis.
