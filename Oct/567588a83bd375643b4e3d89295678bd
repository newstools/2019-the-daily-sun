JOHANNESBURG Mayor Herman Mashaba has resigned from the Democratic Alliance and as the mayor of Joburg. Mashaba said his resignation will be effective from the 27th of November 2019. According to Mashaba his resignation will be held off in order to afford the party a chance to find a suitable candidate to replace him. “By so doing, I will no longer serve as a democratic Alliance Councillor and therefore I’m required to resign as the Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg,” Mashaba said.  Addressing the media, Mashaba said the re-election of Helen represents victory for people in the DA who stand opposed to the his believes and value system. “I cannot reconcile myself with a group of people who believe that race is irrelevant in the discussion of inequality and poverty in South Africa in 2019,”Mashaba said.
