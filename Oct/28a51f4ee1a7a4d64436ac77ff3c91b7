A MAN accused of killing his girlfriend and stuffing her body into a tool box appeared in court yesterday. The 32-year-old allegedly murdered his girlfriend, Zanele Mthimunye (32) in Moloto Village, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, last week. The accused before magistrate Andre du Pree in the KwaMhlanga Magistrates Court on charges of rape, murder and housebreaking. The matter was postponed to the 17th for the accused to apply for a Legal Aid lawyer. Zanele’s sister, Njengi Mahlangu (38) told Daily Sun she was very happy her sister’s alleged killer was finally facing the law. “We still don’t know why he had to kill our sister. They were so in love and we didn’t expect anything,” he said.
