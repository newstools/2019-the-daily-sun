The community got so angry they stabbed him several times. The unlicensed driver ran over and killed a child in Waterloo Verulam
in KwaZulu Natal. Reaction Unit South Africa said they received multiple calls from
the public requesting help for a critically injured boy.  The 10-year-old boy was crushed by the bakkie and died at the
scene. According to RUSA spokesperson Prem Balram, a crowd of more than a
hundred people were in the process of attacking the driver with bricks and
stabbing him with broken bottlenecks. The bakkie driver was stabbed more than 24 times during the
attack.  “The mob also stoned his Nissan bakkie before they set it alight.
Several residents complained that the unlicensed driver who appeared to be in
his teens was constantly seen driving recklessly in the area,” Balram said. It’s alleged the driver was allegedly speeding when he lost
control of the bakkie and drove over the child, who was playing on the side of
the road.  Instead of stopping, he reportedly sped off and crashed into a
boundary fence when he was caught by the community. An empty beer bottle was found in the car.
