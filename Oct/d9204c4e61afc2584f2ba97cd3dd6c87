He and his brother went to a sangoma, who gave them muthi to sprinkle over the cat before removing it. “The sangoma told us the dead cat was placed in our yard by someone who wanted us to fight. “Fortunately, that didn’t happen and hasn’t happened until today. “But we’re afraid something bad might happen and need a very strong inyanga to cleanse the house.” A neighbour said they were called after the dead cat was found in a tree.
