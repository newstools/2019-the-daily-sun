South Africa has the largest travel and tourism sector in Africa, contributing about R426 billion to the local economy last year, according to research by the World Travel and Tourism Council. But crimeâ€™s hurting the sector, identified as having the potential to pull the country out of economic malaise. Recent Stats SA figures show that the number of international visitors is declining. This is not good news for South Africa, which relies on tourism for income and job creation. When people burn trucks, these images are beamed across the globe. Attacks on tourists might not be big news here but spark widespread criticism overseas. We tend to forget that we compete with other countries when it comes to tourism. South Africa is a beautiful and diverse country, but crime messes things up. Protests chase away tourists, and we need to think about our behaviour. This affects jobs and growth in the country.
