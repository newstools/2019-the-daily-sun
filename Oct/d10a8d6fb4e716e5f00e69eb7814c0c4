SHE told her mum she wanted to stay a virgin for as long as possible. She then joined the reed dance at the age of 16 but her virginity was stolen from her two years later when her uncle raped her twice.  The two incidents apparently happened in July and August. The 18-year-old finally told her mum and the uncle (67) was bust. He appeared in the Alexandra Magistrates Court, east of Joburg, yesterday on a charge of rape. Young girls in traditional attire came in numbers to show support. The supporters included Cheryl Zondi Foundation deputy chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva.  “She wanted to preserve her virginity until she was ready. But an old man decided to terminate her virginity, which is totally unacceptable. This is a serious violation and we’ll remain part of the process until justice is served,” said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva. The grade 12 victim was apparently struggling at school since the incident. READ: FROM CASHIER TO OWNER!
