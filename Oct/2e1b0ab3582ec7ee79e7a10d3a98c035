LEGENDARY kwaito group Trompies will not replace Lebo Mathosa in performances of the hit Magasman. Member Eugene Mthethwa said Lebo was irreplaceable and they didn’t see the need to have someone else sing her part. “I haven’t seen anyone who can pull off the performance the way she did. The name Drama Queen didn’t come from nowhere. After Brenda Fassie, she was a natural performing queen.  “All the outfits she wore on stage were unique and beautiful.” Eugene told the SunTeam when they performed the song, they would ask the crowd to sing Lebo’s part. “After her death, there was a popular slogan, ‘motshito otswela pele, which means keep it moving. Out of all the artists we worked with, she was visible,” he said. Eugene said attending the launch of  Dream: The Lebo Mathosa Story was moving. “When I saw all the pictures of her, it was very emotional. It felt like she would jump on stage. She was very lively and I miss her.” “She was like my little girl. She stayed at my house for years. It’s good kids will get to see her story.” Eugene said it was unfortunate that it took international company BET to show interest in telling Lebo’s story. “We have to get into the habit of celebrating our stories. It’s sad government only jumps on board when international companies are involved. Sello Maake Ka-Ncube wanted to make a biopic about Trompies but couldn’t get funding.”
