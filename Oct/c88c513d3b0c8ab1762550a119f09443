MARITZBURG United coach Eric Tinkler has lashed out at Chippa United chairman Chippa Mpengesi. Tinkler said Mpengesi doesn’t respect the industry of coaches and what they go through. Tinkler suggested if Mpengesi could coach, he doesn’t think he’d be able to handle the pressure. “Sometimes people need to be realistic,” said Tinkler. Already Chippa have sacked two coaches – Clinton Larsen was first on 16 September, just two days after Chippa lost 2-1 to Orlando Pirates. Interim coach Duran Francis was next after just two games in charge. Chippa have since appointed former Ajax Cape Town player Norman Mapeza on a three-year contract. With the club currently languishing at the foot of the PSL table, Mapeza must be warned that he has to hit the ground running and pray results come his way, or he will be next in the firing line. Tinkler added: “A coach gets fired because he loses to Orlando Pirates or Mamelodi Sundowns. Are you being realistic? “These are questions that obviously need to be raised... I think a lot of people don’t respect our profession. And how hard our profession really is.” Tinkler is of course talking from experience, having been a victim of the trigger-happy Mpengesi in December last year.
