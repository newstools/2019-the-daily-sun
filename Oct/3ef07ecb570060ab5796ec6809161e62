Magistrate Thenis Carstens said there was no merit to the argument put forward by Cekeshe and his defence. "As far as the court is concerned, it is crystal clear that the applicant admitted all the relevant allegations in the charge sheet. There are no discrepancies between the allegations in charge "It is not in the interest of justice to grant him bail." Cekeshe is the last Fees Must Fall activist to still be in prison.
