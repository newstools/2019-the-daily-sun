HE LEFT pap boiling on the stove and went to the shop but when he came back he was greeted by a flaming disaster! About 26 shacks in Mooiplaas squatter camp in Tshwane were destroyed by fire on Monday morning when the man went to buy cigarettes and left the pap on the stove.  Fearing what the angry residents might do to him, the man ran away without even apologising. Angry residents were still picking through the rubble yesterday afternoon. Resident Alpheus Mokwena (51) told Daily Sun it would take a long time for people to forget what had happened. READ: DAD REVEALS WHY HE DECIDED TO PULL OTHER DAUGHTER OUT “We don’t have anything. No food, no clothes and our property is a pile of ashes.” He said many people came back from work to find they no longer had homes.  “We need counselling and people to help with donations of anything that can help us.” Alpheus said about 39 people, including children were now homeless. He said people should be more careful with paraffin stoves. Resident David Seleke (35), a dad of three, said he didn’t know how he’d recover. “I can’t even say I will start over. I’m not working and I don’t have money,” he said. Tshwane Emergency Service spokesman, Deputy Chief Charles Mabaso, confirmed the fire. “Disaster management and the Tshwane Metro police have been activated. No injuries have been reported,” he said.
