The Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said he
was hated by ‘State looters’ and he is happy about it. On Tuesday, Mashaba took to twitter and
responded to ANC Joburg regional secretary Dada Morero. This was after Morero said it appeared
that the Democratic Alliance has had enough of Mashaba and his Economic Freedom
Fighters associates. Morero said: “It seems that @Our_DA had
enough of this man @HermanMashaba and his close association to the
@EFFSouthAfrica , because we all know, there is no good relations between the
two parties, it’s between Mashaba and EFF.”  In response to this, Mashaba said: “I am
deeply hated by State looters for doing my job. I happy and comfortable to be
hated by such characters.” In August the ANC in the city of Joburg
announced a motion of no confidence against Mashaba. They wanted Mashaba gone
as they accused him of bringing financial ruin in the city. However, Mashaba survived the motion of
no confidence in a council sitting, after the ANC withdrew its motion. This was Mashaba’s second vote of no
confidence in the city council after 2017. Last week, the ANC launched a criminal
case against Mashaba over alleged irregularities in a R1.2bn fleet management
contract awarded to AfriRent. Mashaba said he was not worried about
charges brought against him, adding that the charges were laid by ‘state
looters’.
