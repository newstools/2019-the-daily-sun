NEW TSHAKHUMA Tsha Madzivhandila coach, Erol Akbay, has been thrown in at the deep end: Promote us to Absa Premiership. And club chief executive, Sello Chokoe, did not mince his words: “So next season we must be in the PSL." This is a clear message that Akbay must have agreed to when he signed for the club. The Dutchman must find himself out in the cold like former coach Moma Medic should he fail to abide by his mandate.Medic was fired last month by the Venda outfit. “That target is achievable,” Chokoe emphasised.“When you look at the improvement we have made as a team in the past two seasons, then you can see it is possible." They club failed to win promotion to the PSL in the past season  where they lost out in the promotional play-offs. Chokoe added: “Also looking at the reputation of the Dutch coaches such as Ruud Krol (former Orlando Pirates) and current Ajax Cape Town coach, Andries Ulderink, they have proven themselves in South Africa." When quizzed about the quality of players, Chokoe responded: “We strongly believe in the players we have. They proved it in the past season by reaching play-offs. He added:“When the club was bought at the beginning of 2017-18 season, we had a three-year plan to gain promotion, and now we are on the final year.” TTM are currently fifth on the table with nine points after six matches.
