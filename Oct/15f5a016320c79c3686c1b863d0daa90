LYDIA Mpakanyane is proud of her work. The 35-year-old from Putswastene in Welkom makes and sells shoes. She started the business in 2012.  “My grandfather used to sew and make shoes, while my late mum knitted clothes. So I got this talent from them,” she told Daily Sun. The married mum of three makes sandals and takkies with different designs. “I charge R300 to R350 for the sandals, and R400 for the takkies. “So far my business is doing well, even though sometimes it’s slow, especially in the middle of the month,” she said.

It’s time to stand up for ourselves and change our lives for the better,” said Lydia.
