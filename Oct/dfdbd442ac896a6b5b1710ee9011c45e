EFF Limpopo chairman, Jossey Buthane, is spitting fire. He claimed the media used the VBS scandal to discredit and destroy his party while ignoring looters in the ANC. This came after recent reports that EFF leaders, Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu, benefitted from VBS money. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, Buthane said: “The whole narrative by the media against our leadership is to defocus the EFF from its agenda of achieving economic freedom in our lifetime. “They will never deal with real issues involved in the VBS saga. This attack is suggesting the EFF leadership looted the R2 billion investment of poor people in VBS. “The media and law enforcement agencies have not opened any cases against EFF leaders based on this sponsored narrative.” Sorry I called you a p**s Floyd, the wedding and VBS Juju blueticks Zille Juju shows off his moves! Buthane said EFF officials were dismissed, but there were no politicians from the ANC who were punished for their involvement in the scandal. “The EFF has been calling on law enforcement agencies to investigate the VBS saga. The former mayor of Vhembe and deputy chairman of the ANC in Limpopo have been rewarded with deployment in the Limpopo Legislature,” he said. “No appropriate action was taken against former Treasurer of the ANC in Limpopo Danny Msiza for his involvement in the looting of VBS. “The so-called integrity committee of the ANC has not shown concrete political will to decisively deal with all the politicians implicated in the saga.” During the Oliver Tambo Memorial Lecture in Mankweng, outside Polokwane, on Saturday, ANC Integrity Committee chairman, George Mashamba said those with complaints against the committee needed to wait for the ANC’s response at the right time.
