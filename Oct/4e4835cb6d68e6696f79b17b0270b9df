AN 80-YEAR-OLD gogo is lying sick in hospital and her daughter is blaming Eskom. Nono Huhu said her mum became ill because of the cold weather. This as Eskom refused to restore their electricity since June. “For the past weeks, I’ve been spending my time at Bara hospital. My sick mum is in that place because of Eskom,” Nono said. A delivery truck knocked over a pole in June and 26 houses in Mkize Street in Rockville, Soweto, went through winter without electricity. The residents said they were neglected by Eskom when they tried to speak to them. “If we blockade the streets and burn tyres the government will come running and pretend to care about us. But because we are doing things in a civilised way, we are not being treated with respect.” Eskom’s spokeswoman Reneiloe Semenya told Daily Sun: “The customers’ reference numbers show those customers are in a category of those who are not paying or servicing their accounts. They need to visit Eskom’s customer centre to get their accounts in order. We cannot continue fixing for non-paying communities.” A resident who said she was paying said they were told at the Eskom’s Midway office that their electricity could not be fixed unless the others paid as well. Semenya said customers who have proof of payment will get assistance. “But if they are not paying or buying they won’t be helped,” she said.
