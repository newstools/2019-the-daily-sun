SHACK dwellers were left without shelter on Monday after security guards demolished their homes. According to shack dwellers from Parkgate in Verulam, north of Durban, about 20 shacks were demolished by eThekwini Municipality’s land invasion unit during the attack that they described as illegal. Shack dweller Nokuthula Mngoma (34) said she works at a factory near the squatter camp. “My neighbours phoned me to say there were demolitions. I rushed home to save my belongings,” she said. “When I got there it was too late. They had already demolished my shack. My belongings were scattered everywhere and my wardrobe was in pieces.” Nokuthula doesn’t have money to buy material to rebuild her shack she shared with her three kids. They now stay at a friend’s place. Thembelani Madodana (40) said he couldn’t save any of his belongings.  “The security guards were too aggressive. They were shooting at people who came close to them,” he said. He said some shack dwellers got a taste of rubber bullets. Mqapheli Bonono of Abahlali baseMjondolo said residents face an illegal, criminal and violent form of government. “We’ll continue to oppose state criminality in the streets and in the courts,” said Bonono. Msawakhe Mayisela of eThekwini Municipality said the structures in the newly invaded area at Parksgate were marked for demolition by the land invasion teams. “The people were told to stop invading the land,” said Mavisela. “On Friday, teams met human settlements, which agreed that the structures should be demolished. On Monday, 11 structures were demolished. This was a new invasion and the people had not settled there. No court order was required.”
