THE kasi of uMlazi, Durban will be ululating this Saturday. This is because Uzalo actress Baby Cele will be getting traditionally married to businessman Thabo Moloka. The two have been together for the past five years.  In 2017 they got married in a white wedding ceremony and only decided to host the traditional wedding this year. An excited Baby said that the traditional attires that she and her husband will be wearing on were designed by the Durban designer Mamsie Phoko of the Afrolicious label. Mamsie is known for designing outfits for the celebrities including Jacob Zuma’s wife Nompumelelo MaNtuli Zuma. “It is a great feeling to be traditionally married to the man that I love so much. I hope everything will go as per our plans,” said Baby. The actress who moved to Durban last year to join Uzalo revealed that it was hard for her to leave her husband in Joburg. "It took me a while before I could actually share my plans of moving to Durban with him because I knew this would leave him heartbroken," she explained.
