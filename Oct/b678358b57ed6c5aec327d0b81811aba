STUDENTS at the University of Zululand have apparently taken the law into their own hands. On Sunday, they allegedly beat to death a thug who tried to break into an off-campus residence in KwaDlangezwa. MAN KILLS HIS FRIENDS BECAUSE SANGOMA TOLD HIM HE'S A ZOMBIE! “They called one another and within seconds had all come out of their residences to corner the thug,” said the source. A second source said they beat the thug with sticks and stones. “While he was lying on the ground, he bled a lot. I think that was why he died from his wounds,” said the source. DEAD MAN SPEAKS AT HIS FUNERAL! Last month, Daily Sun reported that protesting students brought the entire area to a standstill. They were protesting about the high level of crime experienced at off-campus residences. The protest was sparked by the shooting of a student, who was attacked by thugs while sleeping. A week later, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said his department was working on a plan to build safer residences. Provincial police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “On Sunday, cops received a complaint of a murder at Khandisa Reserve. PROPHET RAPED AND CURSED ME! “On arrival, they found a man (28) with wounds to his body and head. “He was certified dead on the scene. It’s alleged he was assaulted by students for stealing their belongings.” University spokeswoman Gcina Nhleko-Mdluli said: “We’re still going to investigate, so it would be premature of us to give a detailed comment.”
