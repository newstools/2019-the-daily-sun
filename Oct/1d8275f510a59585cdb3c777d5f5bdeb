DUDUZANE Zuma today told the Zondo Commission he was not a thug. In his closing testimony, he said: “I’m looked at as a criminal, as the face of corruption. This guy who has plundered trillions out of this country, which is not the case. “I’d just like to say to the public out there: I’m not corrupt. I’m not taking money from anyone.” He said former public protector Thuli Madonsela made corruption findings without giving him an opportunity to give his side of the story. “There have been all sorts of allegations of corruption, almost on a daily basis, for about three years. “So what I would have expected was an opportunity to give my version of events. I didn’t get that opportunity,” said Duduzane. But Madonsela yesterday told Business Day investigators even offered to travel to Dubai to speak to him. Duduzane said allegations of corruption against him brought a lot of legal repercussions. He said: “I was labelled a fugitive, I was in so-called self-imposed exile. “I believe I’m unfortunately caught in a political storm,” said Duduzane. Last year, Duduzane was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport for charges of corruption relating to a 2015 meeting where the Guptas allegedly tried to bribe former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas with R600 million. Duduzane claimed he only had a meeting with Jonas and businessman Fana Hlongwane – whom he called Uncle Fana – at the Gupta home to address a rumour that Hlongwane was blackmailing Jonas. He also testified that when he went to fetch Jonas at a hotel, he left his security guards behind and jumped in his car. He said none of the Gupta brothers were at the meeting.
