HE accused his mum of being evil and later killed her. But after the community noticed that they hadn’t seen gogo Lillian Mathebula (66) for two days, they suspected something had gone wrong. On Wednesday worried residents from Casteel Village, outside Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, confronted Maguxe Mathebula (47) about the whereabouts of his mum. He later confessed to have killed her and to burying her body in a shallow grave in the yard.  It wasn’t long before the angry crowd went on the rampage and moered the gogo’s son to death. Shocked neighbour Velaphi Sithole (43) said on Sunday evening they heard a heated argument between the gogo and her son. Who had just arrived home from boozing when he was heard accusing his mum of being evil. “Later the noise died down, but we don’t know what happened as it was late. The next day we didn’t see gogo outside cleaning her yard and greeting her neighbours as she normally did,” Velaphi said. “On Wednesday morning, we braved the situation and entered gogo’s yard. We were shocked to see a shallow grave next to her house covered with flies and partly burnt tyres over it.” Velaphi said they alerted the ward councillor, who called the cops.
