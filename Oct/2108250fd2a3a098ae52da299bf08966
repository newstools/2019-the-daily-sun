SOUTH African referees should be recognised for doing a good job just as much as they get criticised when they make mistakes. This is the plea from South African Football Association (Safa) Chairperson of Referees Committee, Natasha Tsichlas. Tsichlas was speaking in light of the recent spate of complaints and verbal attacks on referees by coaches in the PSL in the past few weeks. A lot of those complaints were directed at Victor Hlungwane who allowed Samir Nurkovic’s “offside goal” to stand in Kaizer Chiefs’ match against Mamelodi Sundowns.

PSL coaches went and threw their toys and everybody believed without checking the evidence. “In our country, there are two controversial subjects. Bafana Bafana and the referees. “Sometimes we must congratulate our referees and say ‘Well done, you did an amazing job’ because some of them cry and say ‘why are we attacked when we make mistakes but don’t get recognised when we do well?’" Safa president Danny Jordaan echoed Tsichlas’ sentiments, saying referees are sometimes made scapegoats by club coaches when things don’t go well for them on the field. “We have a review committee that reviews every decision that they think should be reviewed and one of those was the apparent offside goal that we saw between Chiefs and Sundowns," said Jordaan. “As the league gets more competitive, it’s not the clubs anymore that become the focus but the referees. And that’s just how football operates. A good example of that is the tremendous criticism that was received by the referees during the World Cup in Russia."
