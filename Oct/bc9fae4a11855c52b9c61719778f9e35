THE Telkom Knockout clash between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates will now take place at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium. According to the contractual agreement between eThekwini municipality and Chiefs, they are obliged to play three league matches per season – the City of Durban also in the contract, are entitled to host Amakhosi’s cup home matches. The Glamour Boys were drawn at home in the TKO quarter finals on Tuesday night. “Chiefs and Pirates match will be played at the Moses Mabhida Stadium,” a well placed insider told SunSport on Wednesday. “That is because Chiefs were drawn at home in the TKO cup match. This is part of our on-going agreement.”  Based on this contract, Chiefs last season also fulfilled this agreement. They hosted Pirates in the TKO semi final on 24 November where they lost 2-1. Before that, they also brought on the TKO quarter final against SuperSport on 4 November where defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele scored a scorcher that turned to be winning goal. In the end, Chiefs played seven matches at the venue, others in the Caf Confederations Cup. With Chiefs in the last month of their contract with eThekwini, both parties have also agreed to extend this deal for another three years. Chiefs have already played one league match this season. They defeated Black Leopards 1-0 in the Absa Premiership clash on 10 August at the 2010 World Cup venue. Interestingly, the last time Pirates and Chiefs won cup competition were also at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. For Bucs, it was the Nedbank Cup in 2014. A season later, Chiefs won the MTN8 when they defeated their biggest rivals in the final.
