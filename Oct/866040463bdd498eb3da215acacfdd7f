AN URGENT court interdict by the Newcastle Municipality this week saved residents from load shedding. Eskom last week announced load shedding would begin on Monday after the municipality failed to pay a R200 million electricity bill. But the court interdict was granted on Monday, preventing Eskom from going through with the threat. Municipal spokesman Dumisani Thabethe told Daily Sun the court asked both parties to return to court tomorrow for the matter to be finalised. “Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka has also intervened, so we’re not relaxing,” he said.  On Friday, Hlomuka said he instructed top officials to negotiate with Eskom and was hoping a solution would be found soon. On Thursday, mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba was also left bruised after being attacked by angry workers who said they were not paid overtime. Thabethe confirmed the incident. He said 73 workers allegedly involved in the incident were suspended and would face a disciplinary hearing.
