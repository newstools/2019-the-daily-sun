MANY people don’t know where their
loved ones are buried . . . That's because they lost the grave number and don't know how to locate the burial site. Now, the Zist app's creator, Motsepe Motsegoa, has come up with a very smart idea to locate graves using the technology we carry in our pockets. The app helps you mark and store your loved one’s grave information
and location. For you to add all this
information, you must know where the grave is. The good thing is that you won’t lose
this information again! I tried the app. It looks good and is easy to navigate. The main window has the directory, services, 'add a grave' and notices. If you clock on 'more', you can engage with the creators of the app. Click on 'directory' and you will find towns. From there you can search for the graveyard, site, number
and location.  One thing to know about this is that it is public, so anyone can access the information that you uploaded. This is good for sharing the location to a large group of people, but Motsegoa says they may change this soon. “The aim of this app is to
create a central business for all the logistics regarding a good send off for
our loved ones and make it easy to send out funeral notices”, said Motsegoa.  When you navigate the notices, you will be able to include notices for funerals,
unveilings, after tears and memorials. And you can submit all this information
for free. You even look for the nearest funeral logistics service providers, including catering, tombstones and funeral directors. I already see a lot of Mzansi
people downloading and using this app. Just remember that you need to have
the information first to load it on this App. It is currently free to advertise your services on Zist, so if you are in the audio/video equipment, tent or  marquee hire business, a caterer, florist or decorator, funeral director, a transporter or you erect tombstones, this app may be able to do a lot for your business.
