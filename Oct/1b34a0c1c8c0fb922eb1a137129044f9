SABC CEO Madoda Mxakwe has asked Parliament to give them time to fix the rot at the broadcaster. This was after it suffered a loss of more than R400 million. He was briefing the portfolio committee on communications on the SABC’s financial reports for 2018/19. Mxakwe told MPs there had been steady improvements in the past three years as their losses continued to decrease every year. “At the end of the financial year under review, we had a cash balance of R72 million. Very importantly, we ended the year with a loss of R482 million, and that’s not the whole picture because if you have to go back to 2017, the loss was over R1 billion. Last year, that went to R744 million, which reflects a 35% improvement,” said Mxakwe. He said revenue declined by 3%, which was more than R140 million. He said sport rights were one of the major causes of the decline as they required lots of money. “If you look at the R482 million loss, over R400 million of that is attributed to the investment in the sport right area,” he said. In terms of the fruitless and irregular expenditure, they were still dealing with the ghosts of the past, which they inherited from previous management. The broadcaster had been struggling to pay its employees, but they recently received R2,1 billion of the R3,2 billion bailout it requested from government to stay afloat.
