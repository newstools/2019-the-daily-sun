WHEN he felt things were not going well for him at work, he ventured into something else. Khaya Zungu from KwaMashu C section, north of Durban, said his work was stressful. He wasn’t living the comfortable life he’d hoped for. He thought long and hard and finally decided to quit and start his own business.  Today, the 36-year-old father of five runs two businesses that sell cow’s head meat. He sells the meat with phuthu at Durban Train Station and at KwaMashu Shopping Centre. Speaking to Daily Sun in KwaMashu, he said since he quit his job he didn’t see himself working for someone else. “I stopped working in 2005 and started selling at Durban Station Taxi Rank,” he said.

He said business was good and people supported his business and loved his meat. “I then made a decision that I should stick to the business I had started and never go back to work,” he said. He said after 14 years he realised a lot of people travelled from areas such as KwaMashu and Inanda to get his cow’s head meat at Durban Station. So he decided to start selling it at the KwaMashu Shopping Centre as well. “Since I started selling the meat in KwaMashu in February, those who travelled to Durban Station now get me here.” He said he sells the meat with phuthu only. “I boil the meat and just add salt for taste. I cook plain phuthu to go with it. But some people only buy the meat.” “At Durban Station, even white people and Indians are my regular customers.” He hoped his business would grow bigger and better. “I hope one day I’ll own a big open space where people sit down and eat the meat,” he said.
