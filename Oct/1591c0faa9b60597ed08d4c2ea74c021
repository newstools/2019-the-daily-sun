 Most of them have lots of anger, they voiced their
anger about absent fathers. Nkosikazi Nosandi Mhlauli of AmaHlubi the national
deputy chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders says men and boys’
indabas have given young people platform to vent their frustrations. Speaking to Daily Sun on the sidelines of a
portfolio committee on Arts and Culture, Mhlauli said young boys are angry. In one of the recent meeting in Nyandeni region in
Eastern Cape, she said most of the boys who attended stated that they were
raised by single parents. One of the boys said the father wasn’t there for a
long time but when he came back, he was abusive towards him and the mother. Mhlauli added that at a Men’s Parliament that was held
recently in Buffalo City in Eastern Cape fathers acknowledged that they were
lacking when it comes to taking care of their children. Mhlauli said in Nyandeni boys were given a chance to
express themselves. She said the initial plan was to have a closed-door
session with boys without parents, but the young ones said parents should also
attend so that they hear their concerns. “They needed us as parents to be part of their
discussion, we expected them to say no elderly people must go out but to my
surprise they said we need our parents to sit with us,” Mhlauli said. “We need more discussions with these children,” she
added.
