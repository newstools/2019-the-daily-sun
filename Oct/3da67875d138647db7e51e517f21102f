BAFANA Bafana will be without star strikers Percy Tau and Lebo Mothiba for their Nelson Mandela Challenge clash with Mali on Sunday. This after the duo failed late fitness tests, forcing Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki to leave them out of his match day squad. Tau was injured playing for his Belgian outfit, Club Brugge, last week. He reported for camp carrying a niggling tendon injury on both of his legs. However, Ntseki had hoped the 25-year-old would shake off the knock in time to face the West Africans. Mothiba on the other hand, is suffering from a groin injury that saw him miss multiple training sessions throughout the week. “This has been one of the most difficult camps ever in terms of injuries, and while we have done the best we can to get all the players ready for this important match, it is unfortunate that Lebo and Percy failed a late fitness test and thus cannot be part of the match day squad. We can only wish them a speedy recovery,” confirmed Bafana Bafana team doctor Thulani Ngwenya. The pair, who were Bafana's preferred striking partnership at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), will be a miss for Ntseki. He will be hoping to have them ready for the crucial back-to-back Afcon qualifiers against Ghana and Sudan next month.
