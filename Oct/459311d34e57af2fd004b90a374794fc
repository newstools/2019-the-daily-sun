HAPPY Mashiane says it was an honour to be called up to the Under-23 national team just after recovering from injury. The 21-year-old was a surprise inclusion in coach David Notoane’s Under-23 squad that played two friendly matches in Egypt this past weekend. Mashiane who recently recovered from a toe injury did not disappoint on his first time donning the national team colours according to coach Notoane. “He was one of our outstanding players during this Egypt tour,” revealed Notoane. With his capabilities and the talent he has, Mashiane could be considered when the coach selects his final squad that will represent South Africa in the Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The tournament is set for Egypt from 8-22 November. Mashiane said: “It was a great experience after seven months without football due to a toe injury I was honoured to receive national team call up. I was not expecting it but when the opportunity came, I did not hesitate. “Coach Notoane said my performance was not bad I just need to improve on a few aspects of my game. I’m going back to my club (Kaizer Chiefs) to work on that It was a good trip despite not getting the desired results. And Mashiane also admitted that he still needs to gain more mileage to regain the form that saw him becoming a fan favourite when he was introduced in the Chiefs line-up towards the end of last season. He is one of the ambitious young players who are hoping that they will get the nod when Notoane announces his final squad for the Afcon finals. Mashiane said: “Making the final squad will be a dream come true but now I’m focusing on getting my form back. You know I have just come back from injury and people are expecting to see me playing the same way I was when I made my first-team breakthrough in January.”
