IT was bound to happen, and yes, Cricket SA did the honours by calming the embarrassing situation down when they called for patience with captain Faf du Plessis, interim team director Enoch Nkwe and the Proteas. This they say as they regroup and build a new era following the retirement of many of the Proteas' senior core of players. “It was always going to be a difficult challenge taking on the top team in the world – certainly under their own conditions – in India at a time when we have introduced a new team structure,” chief executive Thabang Moroe said on Monday. “In the past two years we have had to bid farewell to some of the great names of international cricket such as AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn who between them played nearly 450 Test matches for the Proteas. You don’t replace that kind of experience overnight and we need to give a new generation time to settle. “These things take time and I am confident that we will already see improvement in our next Test series when England are our visitors during the festive season. I am sure that our supporters will rally behind them on home turf.  These are, in fact, exciting times for South African cricket with new names and faces coming to the fore. Our talent pipeline has produced the likes of Aiden Markram, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Zubayr Hamza over the last few years and our development systems are clearly in good shape." With the Indian team having written themselves into the history books, with their 11th consecutive Test cricket series win at home, CSA Acting Director of Cricket, Corrie Van Zyl, said: “We need to appreciate the quality that is in this Indian side.”
