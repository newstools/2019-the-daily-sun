RECENTLY retired Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo is pleading with Bucs fans to be patient with caretaker coach Rhulani Mokwena. The 29-year-old Khuzwayo says Mokwena has what it takes to succeed, but needs to be given more time. Mokwena, who took over the hot seat from Milutin Sredojevic in August has struggled to get the desired results. He won just once in seven games in all competitions having lost twice and drawn four times. “Football is evolving in different sectors right now,” said Khuzwayo, who didn’t play a single match for the club after joining them from Kaizer Chiefs in 2018 due to an ankle injury. “I just hope the club is going to be patient with him and give him enough time and support so that he can show what he is capable off.” What has left many people puzzled and doubt the capability of Mokwena is that, since he took over, he has been chopping and changing his starting line-up. Mokwena joined Pirates in 2017 from Mamelodi Sundowns following the appointment of Sredojevic. Having finished twice as a runners-up to Mokwena’s former club in the past two seasons, this was the season Pirates were expected to take the Absa Premiership by storm having learned from two second place finishes. Failing to even emulate that and not compete for the league title will be deemed as a backward step for the Soweto giants. Pirates are eighth on the log with nine points from seven league matches, 10 points behind their bitter rivals Kaizer Chiefs who are riding the crest at the top of table. Added Khuzwayo: “Mokwena is a good coach and very intelligent guy. I do believe that things will, at some points improve.”
