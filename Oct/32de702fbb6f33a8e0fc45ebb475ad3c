WORSHIPPERS were left with nowhere to pray after the municipality destroyed their church. Pastor Sekoati Kgojane (48) told Daily Sun municipal bulldozers arrived at his church in Ipopeng, Mangaung, on Wednesday. He said even though the church was occupying land illegally, he couldn’t understand why it was demolished as he heard a tavern would replace it.

On Wednesday morning, I received a call from one of the church members telling me a bulldozer was destroying the church. I rushed there and I found them smashing the church. I lost everything, including speakers and furniture. When I came here, this place was a dumping site. We spent a lot of money building this church. “My church was healing people. We were praying and casting out evil spirits. I don’t know where I’m going to rebuild.” READ: QWABE TWINS DUMP IDOLS SA! Church member Emily Mosala said what happened was very painful. “I don’t sleep at night. I pray to God to answer for us. We heard rumours that they want to build a tavern here,” she said. Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said no one was allowed to occupy land illegally. “At this stage, we’re not offering any land to the church. They must wait for us to open applications.”
