Jacob “Baby Jake” Matlala was one of the most recognised
sports stars the country has ever produced – especially for his big, permanent friendly
smile. Whatever he lacked in height, he made up for with the bravery
of a lion. “Baby Jake” was only 1.47m tall and was the shortest boxing
world champion ever. Inside the ring, many of his taller opponents left the ring
with painful ribs and stomach ­– because since he was very short, his technique
was to work on the ribs and abdomen part against his foes. Many opponents would retire or throw in the towel during fights
because of aching ribs.  In 2004, Matlala was voted No 72 in the "100 Greatest South Africans" poll
organized by the SABC. Before he retired, he presented his WBU belt to former SA president Nelson Mandela after his fight against Juan Herrera. The former WBO, WBU and IBA flyweight world champion died in
December 2013 after had been admitted to hospital on numerous occasions over
the past few years with complications related to pneumonia. We miss your infectious smile and may your Soul Rest continue to Rest in
Peace...
