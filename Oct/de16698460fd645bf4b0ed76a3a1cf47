Raising a child includes teaching them how to behave in social situations, the correct etiquette, and of course, providing them with access to education. However, many parents stop short of teaching their children how to handle finances and more specifically, how to save. Himal Parbhoo, CEO of FNB Cash Investments for Retail, said the best time to start talking to children about money is as soon as they can count and understand the concept of money. Groceries can be a starting point “The easiest way is to include them in discussions. A great place to start is your regular grocery shopping. They can cross-check at the till point to see how accurate their addition was. It’s surprising how quickly things add up once you start keeping track this way,” he said. Lead by example Notably, the topic of money in the household is no longer taboo. Encouraging your children to ask questions will allow them to see you making financial choices. If you need to buy a car, include them in the details of your decision-making process. Reward a savings mindset In an instant gratification society, the concept of saving and being rewarded by earning interest on your money may seem difficult to communicate to a child. Talk to them about budgets Too many parents often avoid their children’s demands with a simple “We can’t afford it”. “This may be true, but it would be more beneficial to sit your child down and explain to them what a budget is. Teach them to live within their means by showing them how to draw up a budget and not to exceed their income,” said Parbhoo.
