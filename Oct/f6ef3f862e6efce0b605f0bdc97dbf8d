SIPHO Mangesi’s one of Mzansi’s youngest black commercial pilots. The 27-year-old said his journey to becoming a pilot wasn’t easy.  He said he dreamt of flying as child growing up in a small town of Ngqamakhwe, Eastern Cape. “We used to wave at aeroplanes flying past and ask the pilots to bring us goodies. I wondered how an aeroplane made turns.” Sipho said he then grew an interest in aviation, although he had never set foot in an airport. But everyone around him, except his parents, told him he’d never make it as a pilot. “As much as I started with R4 500, my mum and dad tried their best to get me going. They sacrificed everything for me to get my first licence, the private pilot licence.” Sipho said the Department of Transport only gave him the half a million bursary he needed after he got his first licence. He’s now giving back to villagers one flight at a time. “There were hours I’d fly alone. I now use them to fly kids and adults from my home town. I haven’t done a single flight by myself. I always make sure to take someone with me. Giving people an opportunity to fly allows them to dream bigger.”
