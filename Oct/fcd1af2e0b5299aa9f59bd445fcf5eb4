Rapper Kanye West had admitted to telling staff, who worked on his Jesus Is King album not to poke. "There were times where I was asking people not to have premarital sex while they were working on the album," he told Zane Lowe on Apple Music's  Beats 1 radio. The born again star said he is now the son of God and that he is no longer a "slave". "There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me, I was letting you know what the Hennessy had done for me, but now I'm letting you know what Jesus has done for me, and in that I'm no longer a slave, I'm a son now, a son of God," Kanye said. His pastor revealed that Kanye almost quit making music, because he believed it's "the devil's work".
