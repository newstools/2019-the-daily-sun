Relationships
are nice but not everyone on is happy. I’m even
convinced that some people in long-term relationships are secretly miserable. Yes, it’s
nice to have a partner to cuddle with, but relationships can also be terribly
inconvenient. There’s so
much to experience in being single that people often overlook it. Instead they
should be embracing and appreciating it. Having the
freedom to learn more about yourself, grow, and explore, without any of the
guilt associated with taking time for self-care. Some of the
benefits are obvious ones. You have more freedom; more flexibility and you're
not obligated to inform anyone about your whereabouts. #MonateWasingleLife
