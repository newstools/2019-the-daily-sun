Two thugs have been killed in a shootout with cops in Magetle
outside Lebowakgomo. Cops also arrested two other suspects during the shootout. The police acted on intelligence about a black Mercedes-Benz
with four occupants that had committed a robbery in the area. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the police
followed the information and spotted the vehicle with the same description at
Moletlane village. Ngoepe said they tried to stop the vehicle but it sped-off. “The vehicle chase ensued, until at Ntamatise village where
the suspects stopped and allegedly started to shoot the police, who retaliated,
resulting in two of the four suspects being fatally wounded and the other two
arrested,” Ngoepe said. He said the identity of the two deceased is not yet known. The two arrested suspects will soon appear before the
Thabamoopo Magistrate's Court on charges of business robbery, attempted murder
and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.
