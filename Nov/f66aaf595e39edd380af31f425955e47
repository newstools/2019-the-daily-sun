Resident Nokuzola Mdingi (46) said loveLife and police should visit schools to give pupils the number too. Another resident, Nandipha Sogwangqa, said the number would save lives as people often didn’t have airtime to call for help. Western Cape programmes operation manager for loveLife, Themba Maseti, said: “We urge our communities to use the number, and they will get all they need.” Speaking at the launch, the Film and Publication Board’s Nomfundo Ralante said kids needed to be careful about what they posted on social media. “Taking nude pictures and sending them to your boyfriend is very dangerous,” said Ralante. Think of what will happen when you break up or lose your phone.
