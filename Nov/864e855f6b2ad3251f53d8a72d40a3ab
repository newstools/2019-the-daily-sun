ALTHOUGH they have a mobile cop shop, residents of Mandalay have to travel far to report crimes. This is because the station in the Cape Town kasi is closed most of the time. Concerned resident Lulama Jezile (39) told Daily Sun they had to go to Khayelitsha or Lentegeur to get help from the cops.  “What is the use of having a mobile police station if it’s always closed? “They must remove it because it’s useless,” he said. The SunTeam visited the mobile station several times, but didn’t find anyone there. A security guard said: “The residents always come here and go back home without getting assistance.”  Nomvuyo Matwa (40) said they sometimes had to borrow money to travel to other stations. She said the mobile station should either have officers to assist them or be closed. “These people are fooling us. They are not here to help us,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said the station was operational and when members were not there, they were doing patrols. “If there is nobody at the mobile station to assist, residents are advised to report incidents to Lenteguer Police Station or to call 10 111,” he said.
