The school
run turned into a morning of tragedy when a 43-year-old man was shot dead
outside his child's school in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. Police
spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the man was understood to have been a
taxi boss, but his name has not been released yet. Naidu said
the man's wife had walked their 9-year-old son into school at about 08:00,
returning to their vehicle parked outside in Mimosa Road in Fairview. "After
she returned and got into the Audi Q7, and just before they could drive off, an
unknown person approached the vehicle and fired a shot through the driver's
side," said Naidu. Police are
on the hunt for four men following a shootout in Lonehill, Johannesburg on
Sunday. "A
second suspect also approached and fired two more shots. Both suspects got into
a waiting white VW Polo and sped off." The man was
shot in the head, neck and shoulder, and died on the scene. His wife
was not physically injured, but was taken to hospital. Naidu said
they believed the deceased man was the target. The provincial Organised Crime
Investigation Unit in Port Elizabeth is investigating a case of murder. Staff at
the school said they were not allowed to comment. SOURCE:
