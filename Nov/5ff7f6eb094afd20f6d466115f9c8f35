MOLEFI Ntseki will be travelling to England next month.But it certainly won’t be on a holiday. The Bafana Bafana coach intends to use the break to lure Preston North End striker Tom Barkhuizen to the national team. Barkhuizen was born in Blackpool but is of South African descent through his grandfather. “I will also use this break to go to England to talk to Tom Barkhuizen, to the club and his family,” said Ntseki. “If we are happy with his profiling, we’ll see if we can get him a SA passport and be able to bring him in, because we have a concern with the strikers.” Ntseki also said he will be looking to add a few new faces to the team, particularly in midfield positions. He added: “We had a technical meeting and discussed the team and profiling players. “And part of the things that we spoke about is the players who can come to the team and help the current players. “If you look at Kamo (Mokotjo) and Dean (Furman), they are the two obvious choices in the team. So let’s go and profile maybe two players who can come in. "We know that in the Under-23s we have Mokoena (Teboho) and Mbule (Sipho) ‚ and we have Athenkosi Dlala who is playing in the First Division. But it is important for us to look at such positions.”
