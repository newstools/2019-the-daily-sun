Dignitaries, friends and family paid their last respects to late Gauteng Social Development MEC Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe on Friday. Many speakers described Nkabinde-Khawe, who died last Friday, as a woman who loved and cared for children. Speaking in the packed Vereeniging Civic Hall in the south Joburg, her brother Reggie Nkabinde said: “We’ve lost a great person and leader. Thuli was a strict person. I’d take the whole day if I talked about her. “Thuli was a people’s person, a servant of the people. Many of you knew her as Jacob Khawe’s wife. She was not just a wife to Khawe, she was a leader in her own right.” Dignitaries at the funeral included Gauteng Premier David Makhura, ANC Women’s League leader Bathabile Dlamini, Minister of Co-operative Governance Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former arts and culture minister Paul Mashatile, ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule and Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. ANC provincial secretary-general Jacob Khawe said: “Thuliswa feared nothing. She made me a good husband.” Her best friend Zama Nkosi shared stories of their friendship of 40 years. Nkabinde-Khawe received a provincial state funeral and was buried at Meyerton Cemetery.
