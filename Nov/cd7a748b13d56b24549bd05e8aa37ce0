HER NEIGHBOUR said she only hangs her panties out to dry after washing. Her boyfriend said he looks at the sexy panties but doesn’t touch anything. “SHE LIES! SHE HANGS OUT HER PANTIES TO STEAL MY LOVER!” SAID ONGEZWA. “My neighbour thinks she can win over my boyfriend by showing him her G-strings and lace panties.” Ongezwa Mmiwa lives with her lover of two years, Ondela Velebhayi (33), in a backyard shack in Bochabela kasi.  But the problem is that her neighbour, Matale Khitsane (35), lives only a few steps away. When Matale washes her frilly G-strings and lace panties, she hangs them on the line strung between the two shacks. “Matale shows her panties to Ondela to cause a fight between us,” claimed Ongezwa (28). But Ondela said the panties won’t make him leave his girlfriend.  “I believe my girlfriend is angry because she doesn’t wear sexy panties like our neighbour,” he said. “I don’t have a problem with her hanging her panties, but sometimes they get in my way when I have to cross the yard.” He said his girl claimed it’s bad luck for a man to walk under someone else’s underwear. “That’s nonsense,” he said. Ongezwa said she may not have lace panties, but she wasn’t jealous. “My neighbour started hanging her panties in front of my door three months ago after a fight over electricity,” she said. “I don’t want to touch or move her panties because she might claim I’m using muthi. “I always hang my panties in my shack. Why can’t she do the same? “She should change her ways, or else her panties will go missing one day.”  Matale said Ongezwa couldn’t tell her where to hang her panties. “I can’t leave or hang my panties inside my shack and let them get mould. “We share a washing line and she has to deal with it. “I don’t care if she curses my panties. I don’t believe in that. I’m not trying to steal her boyfriend!”
