PREMIER League giants Liverpool lured Springbok captain Siya Kolisi all the way to Anfield on Wednesday. Just under a month after guiding South Africa to their third Rugby World Cup title, the 28-year-old Kolisi ticked off another "dream" of his - watching a live Liverpool game at Anfield. "Howsit guys, it's Siya Kolisi. I am here at Anfield, super excited. It's always been a dream of mine," said Kolisi in video released on Liverpool's official Twitter account. "Thank you to Liverpool for getting me here and inviting me. I think we're going to win today. Probably, I think 2-0 - I believe strongly in the boys. "Watch the game. See you guys. Thank you so much Anfield."
