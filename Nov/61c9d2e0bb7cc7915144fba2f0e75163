THE bruising battle between Thulani Hlatshwayo and Bradley Grobler left Molefi Ntseki fearing the worst on Friday. The Bafana Bafana coach was a spectator when Bidvest Wits went down 1-0 to SuperSport United in their league fixture at Milpark Stadium on Friday, as he monitored his national team players. But the duel between Hlatshwayo, the Wits and Bafana captain, and the United marksman had Ntseki cringing in the stands. The two are key to his plans of qualifying South Africa for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals. Fortunately, they both came out unscathed and will feature for Bafana in their opening qualifier match against Ghana away on Thursday. “I was at the Wits and SuperSport match over the weekend and I was scared by the tussle, the fight, the duels, the physical aggression that we saw between Tyson (Hlatshwayo) and Bradley,” said Ntseki. “I was like ‘I really hope they don’t hurt each other’ because we really need for the two matches. “But being sportsmen, being professionals, I think they conducted themselves very well. They ended the game without exchanging blows and we have both of them here in camp.”
