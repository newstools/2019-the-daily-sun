SPRINGBOK star flyhalf Handre Pollard will miss the team's trophy tour after suffering a broken cheekbone. Pollard sustained the injury last Saturday when Springboks defeated England 32-12 to win the Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. Handre contributed 22 points with his boot in the final, helping the Springboks claim their third World Cup title. Pollard took to social media on Wednesday where he shared a photo of himself in hospital. "Not quite the trophy tour I had in mind. I would do this a 1 000 times over to hold Bill (the Webb Ellis Cup) again," he wrote on Instagram. Pollard finished the World Cup as the leading points scorer - with 69 - and also landed the most penalties (16). The 25-year-old is set to leave the Bulls for French club Montpellier but it's uncertain for how long he'll be sidelined. The Springboks kick off their 'Champions Tour' in Gauteng on Thursday.
