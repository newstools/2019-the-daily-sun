STRUGGLING Cape Town City have complete trust in their reserve goalkeeper Sage Stephens. For the past two games against Polokwane City and Black Leopards, the 28-year-old has been filling the gloves of the Citizens number one goalkeeper Peter Leeuwenburgh. Leeuwenburgh is out for six weeks after sustaining an ankle injury in City’s 1-0 defeat by Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership match played on 25 October at Cape Town Stadium. “Stephens is unbelievable and a class goalkeeper,” said City interim coach Vasili Manousakis. “We are not worried or concerned about Leeuwenburgh’s injury as we believe in Stephens. He made some good saves since he started playing and works hard at training. Before, Leeuwenburgh arrived, Stephens was our number one goalkeeper.” In the two games he has played, the 28-year-old year old Stephens has conceded five goals. City, whose form has been poor this season, have conceded 20 goals in 11 league matches. Manousakis also said they will not take unnecessary risks with midfielder Roland Putsche. The Austrian star has recently returned from a nine months injury lay-off. Said Manousakis: “We have to manage his injury carefully. He played against Polokwane City last week and had a good game. “But we wanted him to play 75 minutes and we ended up pushing him more. We will use this international break to build up his fitness.” Manousakis is expected to return to his assistant coaching position when City’s new coach Jan Olde Riekerink takes over this week when he gets his work permit issued.
