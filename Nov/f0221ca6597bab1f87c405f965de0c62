FOR a second time in a row this season, Kaizer Chiefs have won the Absa Premiership player and coach of the month awards. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp retained the award he won in August as he led his charges to four victories in five matches across September and October. Goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi also bagged the Player of the Month gong, after conceding just a solitary goal in four matches in those two months. During the two months period Chiefs won an impressive four games with one defeat registering 12 points from a possible 15 as they extended their lead at the top of the standings to 10 points. "I'm grateful for this award," Middendorp said. "It's a reflection of the work we've been doing. It is not about me but the technical team, the players and Kaizer Chiefs""There is no break. We will keep on working. If we are in a good mood we will train on December 24 and 25. "Maybe we rest. Or maybe we train. There is no break."Nigerian goalkeeper Akpeyi was delighted with his award admitting that it came as a surprise to be named as the Player of the Month."This comes as a big surprise to me but it also shows the importance of putting effort forward in whatever you do," Akpeyi said. "I give credit to the technical team who have been patient with me. "I'm settling in, I'm taking each game as it comes. Khune is a good keeper, I'm just grateful for the opportunity from the coach. It's healthy competition in that department. I'm just happy to be improving all the time."
