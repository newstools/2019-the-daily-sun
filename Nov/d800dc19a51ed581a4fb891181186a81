BAFANA Bafana got off the mark in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers. They got their first win of the campaign when they edged Sudan 1-0 in their Group C clash at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday. Lebo Phiriâ€™s first half goal was enough to hand Bafana the all-important three points. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki made a number of changes from the team that lost 2-0 to Ghana in Cape Coast on Thursday. Erick Mathoho, Lebogang Mothiba, Lebogang Phiri and Thulani Serero e came into the team as Bafana looked to be aggressive. And their start to the match was a bright one, creating a host of chances that were missed by bulky striker Lebo Mothiba and Thapelo Morena. Just when it looked like the teams would head into the break deadlocked, France-based midfielder Lebo Phiri popped with a stunner to give Bafana the lead. He reacted quickest to a loose ball before unleashing a powerful strike that had the beating of Aboeshren in the Sudan goal. Bafana pushed for the cushion goal, which did not come as they were forced to settle for the 1-0 win.
