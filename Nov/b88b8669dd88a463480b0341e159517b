THE ANC’s consultative conference at Morogoro in Tanzania saved the party and marked a turning point in the fight against apartheid. In his address to mark the 50th anniversary of the conference, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the party emerged from that conference united and cohesive. He told party supporters in Lephalale in Limpopo yesterday that the movement was facing the same challenges today as it did going into the 1969 conference. Ramaphosa said according to Joe Slovo, the conference had “the potential of disintegrating”. He said Slovo said it was the role of leaders such as OR Tambo and the political maturity of the delegates that held everyone together and prevented the ANC from being reduced to conflict and divisions. “At times, it also experienced weakened structures and went through periods of organisational decline. The Morogoro conference was a turning point not only for the liberation movement, but also for the struggle for democracy in South Africa,” he said. “The ANC emerged from Morogoro more united and cohesive, with broad agreement on policy, strategy and tactics, and clear expectations of the political and personal conduct of all in the movement.” Unlike during the days of apartheid, today the struggle was conducted under conditions of freedom and democracy, where the rights of all” were equally guaranteed. He said today people were free to vote, express themselves, organise and protest peacefully. Just like the Morogoro conference, the 54th national conference at Nasrec in 2017 was a turning point for the party, which Ramaphosa said was characterised by introspection and critical debate. Ramaphosa has previously described the period during former president Jacob Zuma’s reign as nine wasted years.
