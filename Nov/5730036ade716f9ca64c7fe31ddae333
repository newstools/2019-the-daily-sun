ACCORDING to Samwu, there’s a big gap in salaries at Mogale City Local Municipality. The union, which has the majority of members, claimed assistant managers were promoted two levels up, with backdated salary payments creating a huge salary gap between them and the rest of staff. A municipal source said they were promoted in November 2017 and their payments backdated to September that year. On Friday, angry municipal workers and Samwu members protested outside the municipal offices in Krugersdorp, west of Joburg, demanding to see Mayor Naga Lipudi. They accused current management of creating an unhealthy working environment. They were addressed by municipal manager Pringle Raedani, who asked for time to prepare for a meeting to address their grievances. Yesterday the union’s regional secretary Kgosi Breedt told Daily Sun the employer agreed to meet them. “The salary levels are far apart. This is unfair labour practice and we lodged a complaint with the bargaining council.” It’s understood that on Thursday, the matter before the Local Government Bargaining Council was postponed to January. The municipality told Daily Sun it could not comment until it had spoken to the union. At the time of going to print, both parties were still locked in the meeting. In the 2017/2018 budget, the municipality said it managed to produce a solid budget after a disastrous previous budget and said it had changed expenditure.
