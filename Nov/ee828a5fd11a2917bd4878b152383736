ORLANDO Pirates interim coach Rhulani Mokwena has hinted that Ntsikelelo Nyauza will step up to lead the side in the Soweto derby on Saturday in the absence of regular skipper Happy Jele. Jele was shown a red card in an Absa Premiership encounter against Maritzburg on Tuesday and will, therefore, miss the big match against Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium. Mokwena though said Nyauza has shown enough leadership skills to fill the void left by Jele. In quotes published in the Sowetan, Mokwena talked up Nyauza's leadership capabilities: "I want to express a special word to him because at the beginning of the season he was not playing. "He has done well to win his place in the team. I call him the beast. He is colossal. "He wins his aerial duels and he is not afraid to pick up players on his own. He has an unbelievable presence in the changing room and he's a leader." It will be the second Soweto derby to be played in seven days after the Buccaneers lost out on penalties in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal clash played last weekend. Mokwena said his players know how important the clash against Chiefs is to the fans and club. "They are human beings and know what the derby means to the club and themselves as players," Mokwena said. "It's was clear in certain moments that their bodies were here with me, but their minds were on the other side of town at the FNB Stadium. "It's okay they are humans and we just have to make sure we get into the right frame of mind." -TeamTalk Media
