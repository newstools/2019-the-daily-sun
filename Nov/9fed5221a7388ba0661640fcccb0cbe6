ORLANDO Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena struggled to find the right words at the post media press conference after his side were beaten in a penalty shoot-out by Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout quarter-final on Saturday. He strongly believes the players are now fighting for him and he has been impressed by his players in their last five games. Pirates went down 4-2 to Chiefs on a penalty shoot-out in the TKO quarter-final at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium at the weekend. The game finished 2-2 after extra time. On the game against Amakhosi, Mokwena praised his players. He said they put in a colossal performance mostly in the first half and also in the last stanza of extra time. Pirates finished the match a man down after defender Mthokozisi Dube was sent off in the 51st minute. Said Mokwena: “You have to admire Pirates players, they were unbelievable,They fought hard, especially when they were one man short. But with regards to how they covered the pitch and motivated each other, they were the best. “I tell you, I’ve got lot of years ahead of me, but those Pirates players are prepared to look after my back and this humbles me.” The two Soweto giants meet again in the Absa Premiership at FNB Stadium on Saturday. But before that, Pirates host Maritzburg United at Orlando Stadium tomorrow.
