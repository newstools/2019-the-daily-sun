MUTHISWA Chila needs help to bury her husband. Her man, Jonginkundla Ganjana (55), died in a shack fire at Europe squatter camp in Cape Town on Monday. Muthiswa said no one worked in the family and they don’t know how they will bury her husband. She told Daily Sun they don’t know what started the fire, as they were all sleeping. “The fire started in the kitchen. I screamed to wake my husband and grandson, but he did not hear me,” she said. She said residents tried to save him, but the fire was too fierce. “I don’t blame anyone because I saw how they tried to save him, but the fire was too strong. They could not take him out of the burning shack.” Muthiswa said she wanted to bury her husband with dignity. Jonginkundla’s son Thembelani Ganjana (39) said his father died crying. “He tried everything to get out of that fire, but failed. He was crying for help and we tried to save him.” He said they were stressed about how they would bury him, as they are struggling. “We don’t have anything, so we welcome any kind of help,” he said.
