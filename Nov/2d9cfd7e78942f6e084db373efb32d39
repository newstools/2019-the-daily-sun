A SERIES of murders, looting and burning of health centres, as well as kidnappings of health workers are hindering efforts to stop the deadliest Ebola outbreak. The skirmishes have in recent days enveloped the capital Kinshasa, Ituri and North-Kivu Provinces that are overrun by the fearsome Mai-Mai militias and communities resisting the presence of health workers. Police have been implicated in the most serious violation, which is the killing of a medical head of a health centre in Kinshasa. An officer shot him dead and has since been bust. In Ituri, village chiefs armed with machetes have forced Ebola responders to flee. A health centre manager was threatened with death as residents looted four centres and destroyed equipment. Six suspects were bust. In the North Kivu, men armed with knives held an owner of a health centre hostage demanding cash they believed was received from the Ebola response. â€“ CAJ NEWS
