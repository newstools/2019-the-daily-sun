RAPPER Priddy Ugly is furious his music was removed from the internet. The musician, whose real name is Ricardo Moloi, told Daily Sun his projects E.G.Y.P.T and D.N.A were removed from iTunes and Apple Music without his knowledge. Priddy Ugly said he contacted Kgosi Mahumapelo, the CEO of his former record company Ambitiouz Entertainment, but he told him he didn’t know anything.  The 27-year-old said he only found out last week after he was contacted by fans. Fifi Cooper also complained recently about the same thing happening to her.
