SOLOMON Linda’s family has accused Ladysmith Black Mambazo of breaking its promises. The award-winning group promised to pay the family R20 000 in honour of Linda’s contribution to scathamiya. But the family have bnow claimed the money was never handed over. The promise was made after Ladysmith Black Mambazo hosted the first Cothoza and A Capella Music Awards, or Comas. Linda wrote the internationally famous song, Mbube. A source close to the family said: “They initially hesitated to be part of the awards. They felt too many people were exploiting Solomon’s name for their own benefit. “Ladysmith Black Mambazo convinced them they were different from the rest and they agreed to take part. Five months later the family hasn’t received the money. “The group has made no effort to explain why the money was not paid. Before the awards, the group was in constant contact with the family, but it has stopped.” The awards were held at the Durban Playhouse in June and the main award was the Solomon Linda one. Linda family spokesman Themba Dladla told Daily Sun: “The family has not received the money. We’ve been waiting in vain. “We understand the group is under no obligation to pay this money. But we would have appreciated an explanation.” The group’s manager and spokesman, Xolani Majozi, said he’d make sure the money was paid this week. “We paid everybody and we weren’t aware they hadn’t received the money,” he said. “If they haven’t been paid, it’s pure negligence on our part.
