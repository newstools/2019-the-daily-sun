A gogo from the south of Joburg has made history as possibly
the first person in Mzansi to marry themselves! Rita Woodall-Terblanche (63), a widow from Vanderbijlpark
had a small ceremony this past Saturday with seven guests. According to the Citizen, sologamy, defined as a marriage by
a person to him or herself, is steadily gaining traction worldwide. The paper further reports that the gogo’s friend led the
ceremony. “I hereby promise
that I, Rita Woodall-Terblanche, will love myself, take care of myself, care
about myself, respect and, above all else, be true to myself, to the best of my
ability. I promise this in the name of the Almighty and all present witnesses”,
were Rita’s vows to herself. After Rita’s vows, she put her wedding ring on her finger,
prompting loud applause and well wishes from her guests. The gogo’s second husband died three years ago and was
married to the first husband for 37 years. Rita is determined to
use her ring to chase away men who are after her money. She told the paper that, “No one can love you as much as you
love yourself. You can also never trust anyone like you trust yourself.” The paper adds that Rita’s wedding to herself is not
recognised legally, and is strictly ceremonial. It is not registered with the
department of home affairs.
