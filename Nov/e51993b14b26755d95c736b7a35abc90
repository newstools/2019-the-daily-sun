KAIZER Chiefs and Orlando Pirates will lock horns for the third time in a space of three weeks in another Soweto derby spectacle. But this time it will be their reserves sides as they headline the Multichoice Diski Challenge derby weekend on Saturday at the Dobsonville Stadium in Soweto, at 3pm. After the senior teams have set the tone with two electrifying encounters when they met in the Telkom Knockout last-16 and Absa Premiership last weekend, a lot will be expected from the youngsters. Chiefs reserves will be looking at completing a sweet hat-trick this weekend while the Pirates reserves will be hoping to restore the image after their seniors lost the two derbies. Amakhosi are coming to this encounter without their head coach Arthur Zwane who is in Ghana with the senior national team Bafana Bafana. Shaun Bartlett will be in charge on the day. On the other end, Glen Salmon will be on the Bucs bench. Both Chiefs and Pirates have never won MDC since it was established. This festival will see two times MDC champs Golden Arrows face AmaZulu while SuperSport United will entertain log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. The matches will kick-off at 11am until late. Arrows coach Vusumuzi Vilakazi, who is eyeing a third MDC title, said bragging rights are at stake. “There’s pride at stake, and AmaZulu have never beaten us since MDC was established. This will be a huge game,” Vilakazi said. The derby feast will not be only in Gauteng. In fact, this weekend, week 14 of the MDC is a derby weekend. Outside Gauteng, there would also be two more derbies that will take place with the Polokwane derby between Baroka FC and Polokwane City at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium and the Mother City derby between Stellenbosch FC against Cape Town City at the Malta Park Sports Ground.
