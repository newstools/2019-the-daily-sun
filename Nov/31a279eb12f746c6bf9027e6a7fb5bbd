DESPERATE zama zamas, searching for smaller gold deposits, have gone too far. They dug under the road near Shaft 13 in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, to search for gold and now the road is sinking.  On Tuesday, the SunTeam saw where the illegal miners opened the hole and where they’ve dug to the other side. Etwatwa police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said the illegal miners apparently damaged an underground pipe. “When it rains, the pipe spills water resulting in the road sinking further.” Motorists are now forced to use alternative routes as the road is closed due to the sinkhole. Angry motorist Billy Setsetse said he didn’t know why the illegal miners were invading the roads.

Spokeswoman Melitah Madiba said investigations were underway to determine the extent of the sinkhole.
