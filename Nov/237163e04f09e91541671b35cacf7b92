RESIDENTS of Storms River want the Koukamma Municipality to convert an empty building into a public library. Parents in the small Eastern Cape town said if the building was left empty, it would soon turn into a drug den and should rather be used to benefit their children. READ: ‘I’M KILLING MYSELF BECAUSE OF OUR DAUGHTER’ Howard Malaicha (43) told Daily Sun his two daughters went to school in Port Elizabeth and struggled to do schoolwork during the holidays. The town had no library. “We’ve long been asking the municipality to provide a library with free Wi-Fi as in other areas,” he said. Phillip Swartbooi (51) said he was afraid drug lords and gangsters would take over the building. “This area has a big problem with drug abuse and gangsters who are vandalising everything of value. “I’m afraid they will do to the building what they did to the sport field where the toilets have been vandalised,” he said. Municipal manager Pumelelo Kate said there were plans in the pipeline to use the building.  “The building is meant to be a library, post office and municipal cashier’s office,” said Kate. “Discussions with the post office and the arts and culture department are ongoing. “We’re lobbying for funding to pave the area and we plan on having it operational at the beginning of the new year.”
