HUNDREDS of Andile Gumbi’s closefriends, family and fans will gather today for his memorial service at the Assemblies of God Church in Sandton, Joburg. A relative confirmed to Daily Sun the late actor’s body arrived in South Africa yesterday morning at about 8am.  Andile (36), who’s best known for his role as Zweli Ngubane on Isibaya, died in Jerusalem, Israel, on 25 October after suffering a heart attack which left him in a coma for several days.

His family last month said he left Mzansi on 2 October to play the role of King Nebu in the musical, Daniel The Musical. The show ran from 10 to 22 October. The family had said Andile was having the time of his life under their company, Wellsprings Productions. “The family were told that on a normal day he suddenly had an illness which the doctors confirmed was a cardiac arrest whereby he fell into a coma from 16 of October and to our knowledge doctors did everything they could. What comforts us is that Wellsprings Production ensured that they flew his wife to be there with him in these times. The family will forever be grateful to the company for treating our son with such dignity and respect,” said the family. READ: WAR OVER IDOLS TWINS!
