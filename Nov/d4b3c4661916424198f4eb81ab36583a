TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula launched a new licensing department yesterday in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. The centre, situated along Link Road in Esselen Park, will provide driver fitness, vehicle registration and licensing services. Mbalula said corruption would become a thing of the past as everything would be done digitally. “Corruption will be nailed down because of the systems we’ve implemented,” 
 he said. “This will allow us to monitor any unlawful acts that are being committed at the centre.” MMC for transport planning and provision Phelisa Nkunjana said: “Our people cannot continue to travel long distances to access government facilities. The centre will ensure they get the services closer.” Motorist Sello Mathebula (55) told Daily Sunthe centre would benefit motorists. But another motorist said: “The centre must tighten up security to ensure examiners don’t issue out driving papers illegally.”
