SHE and her cousins planned a weekend getaway to Durban but now she’s being buried instead. The body of Simphiwe Dlamini (24) was found in her ex-boyfriend’s room in Kwa Mai Mai Hostel in Jeppestown, Joburg, on Saturday night. She was also renting a room at the hostel with her cousins, who told Daily Sun there was a big scratch on her face and her fingers were injured. The post-mortem showed she was strangled. Cousin Zandile Nkosi (32) said Simphiwe broke up with her 32-year-old boyfriend over a month ago. She said Simphiwe feared for her life.  “The man used to beat her up and became obsessed with her after the break-up. He often came asking to see her and got angry when we refused. “One night, Simphiwe said she was scared he’d kill her or us.”  Her other cousin, VumileNkosi (24), said on the day she died, Simphiwe received a call they think was from her ex. She said Simphiwe, who worked as a receptionist at a gym, went out after the call. Their neighbour’s son rushed to tell them he saw Simphiwe scream for help while being pushed against the wall by her ex. “When we rushed there, the lights were off and the door locked. We called out, but there was no response. We were scared because he’d showed off his guns,” said Vumile.  “ We went to the hostel induna for help and called the cops. Neighbours saw the ex jump over the wall.” Cops and neighbours searched the room and found Simphiwe’s body in a blanket on the bed. “We’re deeply hurt. Simphiwe was the breadwinner since her mum died,” said Vumile. Captain Richard Munyai said: “Police are investigating a case of murder and the suspect is still at large.”
