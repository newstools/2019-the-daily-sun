STRUGGLING Polokwane City interim coach Bernard Molekwa is still optimistic that his side will turn the corner. City’s dismal form continued on Saturday after Rise and Shine suffered a 1-0 defeat against their Limpopo rivals Baroka in an Absa Premiership encounter played at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. This was City’s fifth consecutive league defeat. Molekwa was appointed caretaker coach after the club sacked Zlatko Krmpotic on Friday due to a string of poor results. “I believe things will change when we return from the international break,” said Molekwa, who was an assistant to Krmpotic. “We played well on Saturday despite the defeat. We could have won if it was not for their goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze who made a lot of saves. I am positive that we will turn the corner if we continue with the form we displayed on Saturday.” He added: “I have been in charge of this team before and I know what is expected from me. I am looking forward to this challenge until the club appoint a new coach.” City who were flying at the start of the season now have 13 points from 11 games. The last time Rise and Shine registered a win was three months ago when they beat SuperSport United 3-1. Molekwa welcomes the Fifa international break as he believes it will give him enough time to work with his players. “I am happy we are going into this break. It will help us a lot. We have a number of players who are injured and it will give them time to recover before our next league game. We will also work on our mistakes.”
