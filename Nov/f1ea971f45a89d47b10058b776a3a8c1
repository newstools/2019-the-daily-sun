Internationally renowned singer and music icon Miriam Makeba lived a colourful life. When she died in 2008, the world and her family were shattered. Today marks 11 years since her passing. Popularly known as Mama Africa, Miriam died of a heart attack after a 30-minute performance at a concert for renowned Italian writer Roberto Saviano in Castel Volturno, near the southern Italian town of Caserta.  Her foundation, Zenzile Miriam Makeba Foundation, wants her legacy to live forever by remembering her on the day. Her nephew, David Sibeko, said Makeba was loved by everyone and the foundation wanted to keep it that way. “We don’t have a specific event we’ll be hosting to honour her but we want people to take time out to remember her and keep her spirit alive,” David told SunBuzz. “We’re calling on everyone who loved her music to show their appreciation on the day and raise awareness of her legacy.” READ: WATCH: JOHN CENA SURPRISES SHO MADJOZI He said the way she lived should be how everyone lives their lives: treating others with respect and striving to make the world a better place. Miriam announced her retirement from the mainstream industry in 2005 but continued to make small appearances here and there. Throughout her life she always said: “I’m not a political singer. I don’t know what the word means. People think I consciously decided to tell the world what was happening in South Africa. “No! I was singing about my life, and in South Africa we always sang about what was happening to us, especially things that hurt us.”
