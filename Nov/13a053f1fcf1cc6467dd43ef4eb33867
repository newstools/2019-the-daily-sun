DA WESTERN Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela has cited the need to stabilise his party’s provincial structures as the reason for pulling out of the race for interim federal leader. Madikizela was one of three candidates vying to replace Mmusi Maimane, who stepped down as party leader. DA Parliamentary leader John Steenhuizen and Gauteng Legislature leader Makashule Gana are now the only two candidates who will go head to head this weekend for the party’s top job. After announcing his withdrawal yesterday, Madikizela said he had been consulting with leaders in the province since he threw his name in the hat and the general feeling was he should stay on in the province. He said he’d consider contesting for the position during the Federal Congress in May next year.“We’ve just been given a fresh mandate in government and I’ve started in a critical infrastructure department that must stimulate growth and grow the economy,” he said. Madikizela said party leaders in the province believed if he took up the interim party leader position, his attention would be divided and the stability of the province might suffer heading into the local elections in 2021. “It’s the stability of this province that will ultimately stabilise the party nationally, they (provincial leaders) feel I need to stay the course to achieve that. “It’s critical for us to start building our structures and rebuild trust in our voters in preparation for the 2021 local government elections without any interruption to our current leadership,” he said. Madikizela said he therefore decided to heed the advice of fellow party leaders and withdraw from the contest. The opposition will also fill the vacated federal chair position to replace Athol Trollip who resigned along with Maimane.
