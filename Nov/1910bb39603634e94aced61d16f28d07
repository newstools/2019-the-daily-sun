A NURSE who told a patient to voetsek has been placed on suspension. The nurse at Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi, south of Durban, was caught abusing the patient on video. The nurse was suspended on Sunday, but it was still not clear when the video was filmed. ZUMA OWES SCHOOL FEES Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu warned healthcare professionals that mistreating patients was unacceptable. In the 30-second video clip, believed to have been filmed by a patient, the nurse is seen shouting at a patient. “Why are you so insolent, you piece of sh*t! Hey! Voetsek! You’re wasting my time. “I’m trying to put you on a drip to help you. You want tea? Are you here to drink coffee and sleep? “Do you think this is a hotel where we must provide tea and coffee for you?” PICS: DEAD GOGO SHOOK MY FRIDGE! The MEC was horrified by the nurse’s attitude. “I don’t care what the circumstances are or what frustrated the nurse, but that’s not the way to address a patient,” she said. Simelane-Zulu said: “Nurses promise to practise their profession with conscience and dignity. “When we see something like this that’s opposed to those ideals, we have to act.” Patient Thandi Mbuyazi (45) said: “We hope this will send a strong message to other nurses to stop doing this.”
