Your partner's snoring could actually be the reason you have mental health problems, that is according to British Snoring & Sleep Apnoea Association. The study revealed that 20 million people in Britain are sleep-deprived because their partners snore. Having a disrupted sleep pattern increases the risk of depression and anxiety, as well as your chance of developing obesity or suffering a stroke. Brightside reports people who don't get enough shut-eye are also prone to making more mistakes at work, thinking slowly and having a lower level of productivity. Snoring is caused by the soft tissue in your head and neck vibrating as you breathe in while sleeping and the soft tissue it can affect includes nasal passages, the soft palate, the base of the tongue and the tonsils. Here are the risks of living with a snorer 1. Insufficient sleep - This seems to be the most obvious consequence, but lack of sleep leads to health problems that we often don’t take seriously. Both the snorer and those who live with them can lose many hours of sleep, which are vital for the body to recover and fulfill biological functions, like memory consolidation and metabolism regulation. 2. Relationship problems - The fact that your partner’s snoring doesn’t let you sleep can erode the relationship little by little. Listening to a person snoring by your side every night and having to wake them up to stop them from making noise will only make them feel upset. Many even choose to sleep separately or get a divorce after trying to use earplugs or hearing aids to reduce the noise, without getting good results. 3. Hearing loss - A study by Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, sought to evaluate the effects of snoring on both the snorers and their spouses. They selected 4 couples in an age range between 35 and 55, in which one of the members had severe sleep apnea. Here are some possible consequences, direct and indirect, of sleeping near a person who snores:Sleep deprivation and poor quality of sleep
