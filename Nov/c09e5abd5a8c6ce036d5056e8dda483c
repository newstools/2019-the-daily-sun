Zipho “Goldmax” Mthembu worked with international star Zhao and top Mzansi
musicians. Que told the SunTeam: “We’re excited because we keep growing
as musicians and got an opportunity to work with the best in the industry, the
likes of DJ Tira, Ndovukazi, TNS, Deutsch, Zanda Zakuza, Dladla Mshunqisu,
Tipcee, Mampintsha and an international feature with Zhao.” The duo also bagged a long-term deal with Monster energy

with Monster and are the only ones in Mzansi at the moment. They call us
‘Monster Athletes’. We’re looking forward to working with the brand, especially
because we’re in the same space. “This partnership will give us a chance to reach a wider
audience.”
