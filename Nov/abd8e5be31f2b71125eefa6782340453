A MADALA is nursing his wounds in hospital. He was attacked by a rottweiler in Signal Hill Village in Mahikeng, North West, on Monday. He said he was lucky to be alive. Madala Justice Motshwaedi said he was herding his cattle, which were grazing next to a yard belonging to a businessman, when he felt something grab him by the arm. “I thought it was a person. When I looked, I saw a dog and its teeth were already clinging onto my arm.” The 73-year-old said the dog’s head was outside the fence, which has openings in between. “It pulled me towards the fence and would not let go of my arm. I had no choice but to pull back my arm, leaving some of my flesh in its mouth,” he said. The incident angered villagers, who demanded the dog owner remove it from the village or leave. Resident Salthiel Ramatlakana alleged he was pointed at with a firearm by the businessman’s son when he tried to intervene. “He pointed a gun at me and told me there was nothing I could do about it,” he claimed. Headman Motlhoiwa Majaha said he planned to call a community meeting to discuss how to approach the dog owner. “This is our land. He must remove those dogs before they kill us all if he still wants to operate his businesses here,” he said. The SunTeam visited the business premises and found the owner’s son. “Why was he standing so close to the fence knowing there’s a dog here. I’m not going to take the responsibility. There’s nothing I can say,” he said. The madala said he tried to open a case but he was told to go report the owner to the SPCA. North West police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani promised to respond to Daily Sun’s queries, but hadn’t done so at the time of going to print.
