AFTER speculations
about his health, Mandla ‘Mampintsha’ Maphumulo has set the record straight. A recent
video of Mampintsha trended on Twitter as his fans couldn’t figure out if
Mampintsha wasn’t feeling well or if he’s on a healthy journey. Is it me or he sounds and looks mentally disturbed #Mampintsha https://t.co/bB3vxviunr  This led to
many speculations as to what could be wrong. Now, Mampintsha
has set the record straight – he says he is not sick and those who believe
otherwise can continue to do so.
