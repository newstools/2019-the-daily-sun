MASKANDI artist Sanele “Swenka Ngemali” Mthalane was left fuming after Ukhozi FM banned his song, Suka Phez Kwami. That’s because part of the song says: “Get off me. You’re merely rubbing yourself against me and I’m tired of it. Go and ask others to teach you.” Speaking to Daily Sun, he said: “My song was on high rotation on Ukhozi FM and people loved it. I got a call it would no longer be played. They didn’t explain much and I didn’t ask questions. “My question now is why they played it in the first place if they didn’t like it. I still maintain the song is not about sex. It’s a warning to those who create stumbling blocks in my music career.  SABC spokeswoman Mmoni Seapolelo confirmed the song was banned by the station. “It was not in line with Ukhozi FM’s music policy. The song was found to be sexually explicit and inappropriate for the station’s audience,” she said.
