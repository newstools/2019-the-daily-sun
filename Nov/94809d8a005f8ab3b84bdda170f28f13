TWO suspects accused of murdering Lethabo Nkoana appeared in court yesterday for a bail application, but it was postponed to today. Nkoana, an ANC Youth League member from Mamelodi in Tshwane, was shot and killed during a scuffle that broke out at rally in Hammanskraal on 9 November.  Investigating officer, Sergeant Martin Mojapelo, told the Temba Magistrates Court the accused should not be granted bail for their own safety. The two men, Kagiso Kekana (29) and Boitumelo Moatlhodi (28), handed in affidavits indicating they were pleading not guilty. They were both facing charges of murder, attempted murder and being in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Moatlhodi said he had no idea why he was arrested, claiming he didn’t know the state witness and was not in the area on the day of the shooting. Kekana, accused of being the getaway driver, said he was a self-employed accountant and family man. READ: THE TERROR OF A CAT TAXI DRIVER! Sergeant Mojapelo said Moatlhodi should be denied bail because he failed to confirm a permanent residential address. “I hear people talking about this and I get worried they might take things into their own hands,” he said. ANC national youth task team spokeswoman, Sizophila Mkhize, hoped justice would prevail. “The members of the ANC are wondering what is going to happen,” she said. “It’s part of the reason we don’t want to take the law into our own hands. We hope they don’t get bail. “We will come back and are hoping for the best. It’s an interesting case. “We’re confident that the state will be able to take this case forward.”
