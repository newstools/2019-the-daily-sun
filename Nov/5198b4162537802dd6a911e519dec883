UNAI EMERY has been forced to cancel a “masterclass” university lecture after being bombarded with online abuse from its students. The beleaguered Arsenal boss was set to deliver a speech on Friday at Wembley’s University Campus of Football Business. The lecture was billed as a part of a “masterclass” event for students interested in coaching and combating prejudice. UCFB announced Emery’s talk on their website and Twitter page. But the event was met with mass derision and negative comments aimed directly at Emery. The Spaniard’s appearance was cancelled as a result. And Emery is now free to focus on upcoming games against Eintracht Frankfurt and Norwich City. UCFB students received emails letting them know the plug had been pulled on Emery’s talk. A message read: “It is with much regret that we can no longer present Unai Emery to UCFB students this Friday. “We have noticed that there were a number of negative comments aimed at Mr Emery when the guest appearance was initially announced. “We would like to take this opportunity to remind all students of the digital footprint that you create, which could impact you throughout your career within the football and sports industry.” Emery, 48, is under huge pressure at the Emirates after failing to win any of his last five league games. It's left Arsenal eighth in the table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and eight points off the top four. And the claws are out for Emery after Saturday’s 2-2 home draw against strugglers Southampton, with Alexandre Lacazette netting a 96th minute equaliser to spare Arsenal’s blushes. Mauricio Pochettino has been linked with the Gunners after being sacked by North London rivals Spurs. - The Sun
