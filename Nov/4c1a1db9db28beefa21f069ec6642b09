French Montana has been in the intensive care unit since last week. According to earlier reports, the rapper was rushed to hospital after experiencing nausea and intense stomach pains in his house in Los Angeles.  He was picked up by an ambulance after his neighbours called the police. "One of French's neighbours was under the belief that the rapper's house was being burglarized, so they called the police. When cops arrived, there was no robber to be found, but they did find that French was experiencing some major health issues. they ended up calling 911 and had him taken to the nearest hospital where he's remained in ICU ever since," read an article by XXL. The rapper shared a video of himself in a hospital room on Monday, 25 November and captioned it "6 days in ICU". He has since removed the tweet.
