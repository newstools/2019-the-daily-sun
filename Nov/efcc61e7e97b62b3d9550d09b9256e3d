BONGIWE’S mud house is so small her eldest child, who’s 20, is forced to crash with friends or neighbours. The 36-year-old Bongiwe Zulu from Nkundusi Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, has eight kids. The youngest is one.  The single, unemployed mum inherited the one-roomed house from her mum Thembi Mthiyane, who died in 2010. “It’s in a bad state and I don’t have money to build a new one, she said. “The windows are broken and the front door doesn’t close properly. “When it rains we spend the night on our feet as the floor gets flooded.” There are no RDPs in the area, and Bongiwe is illiterate and jobless. “We survive on the child support grant. That’s how we’re able to buy food,” she said. READ: TWINS DUMP HUSBAND! Bongiwe said it hurt that her eldest son Vusi Khoza had to sleep at other people’s houses. “When the girls bathe, the boys have to go outside. “I fear the house will collapse on us one day because it’s not stable. I don’t know where we’ll go if it collapses.” The father of her eldest two kids died years ago and she doesn’t have a relationship with the father of two of the kids. She’s still with the father of the last four kids. But he doesn’t live with them. Bongiwe appealed to SunReaders to help her with building material, stationery for the kids, clothes or food. Ward councillor Vincent Madonsela said the area had too many poor families in need of houses, 100 of whom had been placed on the waiting list for RDPs. However, Bongiwe’s family is not part of the 100.
