MORE than 380 undocumented foreigners were taken in for processing and verification after cops raided several places in Joburg at the weekend. In one raid, about 300 undocumented foreigners were found in a 21-storey Hillbrow building. Cops bust three suspects in connection with the building’s hijacking after they managed to trace its rightful owner. Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told Daily Sun the 380 undocumented foreigners were from Malawi and Zimbabwe. “Six Malawians, of whom four are juveniles and two are pregnant women, were released pending their appearance before immigration authorities to prepare for their direct deportation,” she said. A number of unroadworthy vehicles were impounded and fines issued at various roadblocks across Gauteng. In another raid, counterfeit goods with a total street value of R25 million were seized. Police also seized equipment such as stencils and plates suspected of being used to produce counterfeit luxury and sports brand labels. A number of pubs, clubs, liquor stores and tuck shops were also raided. Police, working with officials from the Gauteng Liquor Board, issued fines amounting to R9 000 and confiscated liquor valued at more than R1,4 million. A suspect was arrested during the liquor outlets operations. Peters said counterfeit rolling paper and cigarettes were also confiscated. “A fraud case was opened in Midrand pending further investigations after a tip-off on suspected stolen SIM cards led us to a warehouse. “SIM cards of various cellphone service providers packed in thousands of boxes together with suspected SIM-card manufacturing machines were seized. “About 20 undocumented foreigners were found on the premises,” she said. “The public are encouraged to use the newly launched MySAPS app to provide tip-offs anonymously and/or to find their nearest police station.”
