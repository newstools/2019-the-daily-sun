WHEN neighbours saw flames leaping out of a house, they rushed to the scene to try to put it out. But their attempts were in vain as they couldn’t break down the doors. Gogo Anna Nciyana (77), her granddaughter Sizakele Mhlongo (29) and great-grandchild Mpendulo (3) from Inanda, north of Durban, burnt to death in their home on Saturday. Gogo Anna’s daughter, Dolly Zulu (52), told Daily Sun she received a call that her mum’s house had burnt down.  She rushed to the house and found firefighters had already put out the flames, but her loved ones were already dead. Dolly said she was told neighbours tried to save them, but couldn’t open the doors or break the burglar bars. “My mum’s body was found in the toilet. Sizakele’s body was found in her bedroom, while Mpendulo’s body was in the dining room.  “I think they were trying to escape from the flames through the windows as their bodies were found near windows,” she said. She said the cause of the fire was still unknown. “The three lived together. There was electricity, so we don’t know what started the fire. “Nobody heard them cry for help,” she said. Funeral arrangements have not yet been made. Cops have opened an inquest docket and are investigating a case of arson.
