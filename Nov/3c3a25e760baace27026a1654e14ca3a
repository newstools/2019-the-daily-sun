BAFANA Bafana team doctor Thulani Ngwenya gave an update on the injuries in camp ahead of the teams crucial match against Sudan at Orlando Stadium on Sunday. Kamohelo Mokotjo who was not part of the match day squad when Bafana were defeated 2-0 in the first 2021 Africa Cup of nations qualifier match against Ghana on Thursday will be available for selection for the Sudan crunch encounter. Ngwenya clarified why the 28-year-old, Brentford midfielder did not feature against The Black Stars of Ghana. "To clear the air I want to start with the issue of Kamohelo Mokotjo because a lot of people have been asking questing on what is happening, why he was not part of the team," Ngwenya stated. "After an assessment that we have done as medical team we realised that Kamo has played six matches in three weeks. In all those matches he played 90 matches" He traveled and arrived at camp a day before the actual match. When we assessed him he was really fatigued. He could not give us 90, minutes, he could not give us 45 minutes" The doctor went on: "Then we had to take a medical decision, to rest him for the game against Ghana so that he is fresher for the game against Sudan. "It was purely a medical decision it had nothing to do with the technical team, they were advised by us to rest him." The doctor also confirmed that Bongani Zungu, sustained a knee injury against Ghana. "The pitch was heavy, it was uneven, it's not an excuse but Bongani slipped and sprained his knee. We made a quick assessment  he was in excruciating pain. He was a forced substitution, but he has made improvement but we are taking him for a scan that is when we will make a decision if he is fit." Other players who have sustained injuries and are under treatment are defender Thami Mkhize who sustained an ankle injury and Thapelo Morena who has a calf strain.
