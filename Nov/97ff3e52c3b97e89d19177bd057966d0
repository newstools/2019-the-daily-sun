THE 2019 Telkom Knockout final will be staged at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on December 14, the Premier Soccer League confirmed on Wednesday. The decider will return to the iconic 2010 FIFA World Cup venue for the first time since the 2015/16 season, and for the fourth time in all after previous finals in 2011/12 and 2012/13. It will be the seventh time that the final had been played in Durban since 2008/09 though with the Chatsworth Stadium, King’s Park Stadium and Princess Magogo Stadium also used in that time.
