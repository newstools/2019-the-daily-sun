KAIZER Chiefs will not underestimate Chippa United in their Absa Premiership encounter on Wednesday. This is according to Amakhosi mentor Ernst Middendorp.The two sides will lock horns at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth (7.30pm). Speaking on the clubs' website, Middendorp insists that despite their position on the log – bottom – the Chilli Boys deserve respect. “It is these kind of games where you’re required to focus,” insists the German tactician. He believes his side will have to forget about their upcoming titanic clash against arch rivals Orlando Pirates at the weekend if they are to get anything against Chippa. “The games that come in between the hyped matches are more critical and demand maximum attention,” continued Middendorp. “I saw Chippa United on Sunday playing in the cup game. They were totally different from what I have seen in their previous matches. They gave Mamelodi Sundowns a good run. So, we have to be ready for them. “The Soweto Derby coming up on the weekend is a big match of course, but we will only deal with that after the Chippa game. “This is when you have to work on the mind-set of the team. We must be responsible and not lose focus.”
