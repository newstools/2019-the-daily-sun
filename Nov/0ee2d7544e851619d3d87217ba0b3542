Polokwane City suffered their eighth loss in a row in all competitions against Bloemfontein Celtic in the Absa Premiership clash on Saturday afternoon at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. Victor Letsoalo who was introduced in the second half scored the only goal of the match in the 82 minute, which saw his side registering their fourth win in the league this season. The result will now put coach Bernard Molekwa who has been incharge of the team in just three games under immense pressure ah he seems to be struggling to pick up Zlatko Krmpotic pieces. After a promising start by Rise and Shine, there was a sudden change which saw the club suffering seven defeats in a row ahead of yesterday’s match. They lost 2-0 to Highlands Park‚ 2-0 at home to newbies Stellenbosch FC‚ lost twice 1-0 and 2-1 against Golden Arrows in a Telkom Knockout and league game respectively‚ 5-3 away to Cape Town City‚ 1-0 at home to neighbors Baroka FC and 3-2 to Orlando Pirates midweek before the slight 1-0 defeat against Celtic. Letsoalo solitary goal proved to be enough to hand the visitors maximum points and extend their unbeaten run to four matches.
