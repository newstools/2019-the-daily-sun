WHEN the late soccer star Lesley “Slow Poison” Manyathela died in 2003, his municipality honoured him by naming a stadium after him. But the stadium was vandalised and is no longer in use. Lesley’s mum Gladys (57) said the family was happy when the stadium was named after her son. “I’m so ashamed that the stadium, which is supposed to be a legacy for my son, isn’t looked after or maintained by the municipality. It’s better not to call it the Lesley Manyathela Stadium anymore because it’s not being looked after.” The stadium has allegedly been turned into a drug den and when the SunTeam went there on Saturday, a group of boys were smoking on the grandstand. While the window glasses were broken, the main front entrance which is designed in a glass, has holes on the glass that looks like stones were thrown at it. Gladys said a security company was only hired last year after she complained to the municipal manager. “The gates, fence and windows are broken. Soccer poles and the fence are collapsing from the rust.” Musina municipal spokesman Wilson Dzebu said they were aware of the challenges at Lesley Manyathela Stadium and measures were in place to address them. “The family is welcome to engage the municipality about their concerns. But the municipality has put aside a budget to refurbish the facility during the 2020/2021 financial year.”
