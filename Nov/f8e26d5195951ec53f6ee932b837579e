 WHILE some South Africans are still riled up over Burna
Boy's tweet that he would never set foot in Mzansi ever again, following the
recent xenophobic attacks, EEF leader, Julius Malema, is ready to welcome him
with open arms. The star had tweeted that he wouldn't come to this side of
the equator until the government woke up. Reads the tweet: "I have not set foot in SA since 2017.
And I will never ever go to South Africa until the South African government
wakes the f**ck up and performs a miracle, because I don't know how they can
possibly fix this." But Malema has ruffled feathers with his tweet, in which he
said he is looking forward to being entertained by Burna Boy. Tweeted the CIC: "Looking forward to receiving and
being entertained by my brother @burnaboy here at his home called South Africa.
There's no mascot that can stop him from performing, he's one of our own and we
will protect him. We must resolutely oppose regionalism led by political
illiterates.‚Äù  "Looking forward to receiving and being entertained by my brother @burnaboy here at his home called South Africa.
