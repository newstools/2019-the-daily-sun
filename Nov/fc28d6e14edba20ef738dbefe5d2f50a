THE man known as the grass pastor, Lesego Daniels from Rabboni Centre Ministries, told Daily Sun he’s back – and this time it’s for good! “I’m led by God and He guides me,” the pastor said at his church in Akasia near Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane. The pastor has been quiet for quite some time. He first made the news in 2015 when he made church members drink petrol. He later fed them grass and flowers. Now he’s back in the news again, giving his followers amashongololo, sparkling wine, which he claimed was alcohol-free, and fried chicken during his sermons.  Daniels (48) said he has never done anything harmful to anyone. He claimed he also drank petrol and ate the grass. “It tasted like sweets,” he said.  “I began performing strange miracles in 2002 when I started the church as a young man. That’s why they thought I was playing games with my followers, which isn’t true.” He said he’d never bring booze to his church. “We’re a church that fights substance abuse.” Daniels said he has dealt with criticism and people have told lies about him.  “When I do what is right, I’m only interested in pleasing God. People judge me for the miracles I perform, but they don’t know the secret behind it,” he said. The pastor said he was surprised he didn’t suffer from high blood or depression because of the persecution he endures every day. He said his wish was for other pastors and prophets to work with him in doing the Lord’s work. Daniels didn’t want to talk much about his problems with the CRL Commission but said he wasn’t on the run. He’s waiting for them to come and talk to him.
