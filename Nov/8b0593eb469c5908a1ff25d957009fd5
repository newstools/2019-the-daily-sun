On Tuesday
the police joined by the Deputy Minister of Police, Cassel Mathale and the
National Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole destroyed guns at Arcelor Mittal
Steel in Vereeniging. These are
firearms that were either confiscated by police or surrendered by owners. Last month,
a notice was published in the Government Gazette that interested parties who
have a valid claim to the firearms to come and make representations as to why
the identified firearms and ammunitions should not be destroyed. The police
said only four people made representations on 4 firearms that were destined to
be destroyed. “More than
half of the destroyed firearms were confiscated by the police during
intelligence driven operations, routine stop and searches as well as tip offs
from law abiding citizens of this country,” said police spokeswoman Colonel
Brenda Muridili. In April
over 30 000 firearms were destroyed. Muridili
said: “It is worth noting that the detection and confiscating of firearms is
one of the areas that station commanders are evaluated on as part of crimes
detected through police action or initiative. Daily, members on patrol are
bravely stopping and searching suspicious vehicles looking for contraband and
illegal firearms. “The police
have to continually detect and remove illegal firearms from circulation as they
are being used to commit serious and violent crimes,” said Muridili. Muridili
said 329 firearms of heritage value comprising of handguns, rifles and shotguns
were identified and removed from the destruction list. She said
they were handed over to the South African Heritage Resources Agency.
