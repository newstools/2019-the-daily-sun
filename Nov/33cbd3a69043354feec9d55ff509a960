Eighteen years after making its TV debut on ABC, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show will not appear on any network in 2019. This is because the lingerie giant’s parent company, L Brands, had long relied on traditionally attractive models such as Gigi Hadid, Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner to sell their stock. And, for years, it worked. They racked up millions of sales over two impressive decades. But, despite this success, they’re now being forced to ignore the free market demands and rebuild the entire notion of beauty. The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show had traditionally aired before the holidays. It usually makes its way to television in either November or December. So, with December rapidly approaching, an announcement had to be made, and this year, it was to forego it. The annual Victoria’s Secret show usually takes place in New York.
