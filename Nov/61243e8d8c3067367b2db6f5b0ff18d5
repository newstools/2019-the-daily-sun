BANYANA Banyana midfielder Thembi Kgatlana says 2019 was the best year of her career, but believes she still has a lot to offer to the women’s game. At the beginning of the year, the Mohlakeng-born striker was crowned the Caf Women’s Player of the Year. She became the second Mzansi player to bag that accolade after veteran Noko Matlou, who had the honour bestowed on her in 2008. She also won Goal of the Year for the goal she scored against Nigeria during the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana last year. Weeks later, she signed a contract with Chinese club Phoenix where she played 11 games and netted six goals. Rising like a phoenix, Kgatlana further etched her name into history books when she scored South Africa’s first ever World Cup goal. “It takes a lot of sacrifices, commitment and consistency to stay on top of your game day in and day out," says Kgatlana. “With the consistency that I continuously show in my game there is a lot that is still going to happen in my career" "The year 2019 has indeed been great with all the nominations. Surely my hard work doesn’t go unnoticed" For the third time in a row now, Kgatlana is nominated for the Caf Women’s Player of The Year, alongside Banyana captain Refiloe Jane. She will be hoping to become the first SA Women Player to win this accolade twice in a row. Banyana coach Desiree Ellis has also been nominated for the Caf Women’s Coach of the Year while her Banyana will be vying for the Team of the Year award.
