NEVER judge a book by its author, because you might be surprised! Phumla Mkhabela is one girl who has shown that one is never too young to write a book. The 10-year-old pupil launched her first English book yesterday titled Kind Learners in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. The book teaches learners to be kind, forgiving and loving in order to have happy minds and happy souls. She told Daily Sun that when she was afforded the opportunity to take part in the programme, she felt great because she had been aspiring to write a book all her life. “I’m happy because this means my dream has come true. This means I’ll have to express myself more,” she said. Phumla was one of 26 pupils who were part of a programme initiated by Bala Books. The organisation helps to nurture young minds to become authors. The pupils come from Ifalethu and Sibukosethu primary schools in Nyongane, outside Hazyview, Mpumalanga. They all launched their Siswati and English story books yesterday. They are the first group of pupils in Mpumalanga to publish books. The pupils attended a writing course hosted by Bala Books before they started writing. Glad Kaiser, the head of the organisation, said: “What’s great with this initiative is that we see African children telling their stories. We’re talking about generational worth creation and socioeconomic transformation.” Another child author, Sjula Ngwenya (13), said he was happy he finally launched his first book titled Umndeni Lowahamba Utfungasa Imicebo Lefihlakele. Itis about a family who goes on a hunt for treasure in Egypt. “I’m officially an author and I believe this is the beginning of great things,” he said. Mpumalanga Education MEC Bonakele Majuba said the initiative would be taken to other schools across the province.
