It’s that time of the year again when everyone is excited about the festive season and Black Friday. A lot of people can’t wait to spend money on discounted deals. But have we asked ourselves if we can really afford these specials? Black Friday deals aren’t necessarily built to help you save money but make you spend it. It really is a marketing strategy to build the economy and pull the pool of potential buyers in for the festive season. Ninety percent of people spend their whole November salaries on unnecessary things because they know they’ll be getting their bonus in two weeks’ time. Marketers know people think this way. They’re not stupid. This is a strategy they’ve come up with to get people to cross over to impulsive buying, overspending on goods they don’t need and haven’t budgeted for. Black Friday is ideally for people who’ve budgeted for certain products and waited the whole year. Ask yourself: Do I really need this? Did I budget for this? Can I afford it?’ Here are some tips: Trust me, you don’t want to go into 2020 still paying for those discounted deals. Wise up. Don’t spend hard but rather spend smart and resist the debt trap.
