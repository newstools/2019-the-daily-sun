It is no secret that there seems to be a market for penis enlargement and Indonesia might just be capitalizing on it by making itself a tourist destination for Penis Enlargement Massages. Penis Enlargement is very popular in Indonesia and it seems they are about to cash in in it. According to Vice Indonesia, the country’s Minister of Health, Terawan Agus Putranto, declared earlier this week that Indonesia’s traditional forms of medicine should be put at the forefront of tourism to attract people from overseas. “We must popularise the idea of traditional medicine for tourism. We have an incredible herbal medicine industry that no one knows about outside Indonesia,” Putranto told local media. “Don’t underestimate kerok. If we had 100 rooms and it takes 20 minutes per person, imagine how much revenue that would generate. There are many other cultural gems that we have not exploited because we take them for granted. But to foreigners, it’s something intriguing,” Putranto said. Untung Suseno, head of the Ministry of Health’s Tourism working group, agreed that Indonesia has the potential to expand its health tourism industry, but through spas.
