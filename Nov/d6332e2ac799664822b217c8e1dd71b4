KAIZER Chiefs opened a 10 points gap at the top of Absa Premiership following their 3-2 victory over Soweto rivals Orlando Pirates at a sold out FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Chiefs, who have been firing in all cylinders since the beginning of the season defeated Pirates 3-2 in a thrilling encounter. This was one of the best matches between these two sides, arguably it banished the the recent history of the dull draws which we have seen when these two teams played each other.Ernst Middendorp's charges were the first to find the back of the net when  Ntsikelelo Nyauza headed the ball into his own net as goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands was not on his line in the first minute giving the Amakhosi a perfect start in under 50 seconds. Leonardo Castro, who put Nyauza under pressure to make the mistake that lead to the first goal of the match scored on the 28 minute to make it 2-0. Pirates winger, Vincent Pule pulled one back for the visitors from a well taken set-piece just moments before the halftime break. Gabadinho Mhango levelled the matters to 2-2 with a fine scorcher in the two minutes before hour mark. Daniel Cardoso’s penalty, after Bernard Parker was brought down in the box, earned Chiefs maximum points. There was a late drama in the last minute of the match, after Chiefs were reduced to ten men after Erick Mathoho was sent off for pushing Abel Mabaso in a scuffle from both set of players which was started by Lebogang Manyama and Mhango. Tshegofatso Mabaso could have leveled the matters with the last kick of the match when he got clear cut chance in stoppage time but his shot was easily saved by Daniel Akpeyi as Chiefs registered their nine win of the season. Chiefs are now 10 points clear at the top of the table. They have gathered 28 points in 11 matches. Reigning PSL champions, Mamelodi Sundowns are second with 18 points with two games in hand.
