SUMMER is here and kids around Mzansi want to play in water. But over the years, this has led to many children drowning. Last month, Daily Sun reported that siblings Ntakadzeni (10) and Adivhaho Mathiki (8) drowned outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo after falling into an open trench.

He said anything getting into one’s airway, liquid or solid, could cut off one’s air supply and led to drowning. “One doesn’t need a lot of water to drown.

She went swimming with other pupils before the start of their final exams. Ntladi said the festive season was notorious for drownings. “Schools will close soon and children will be roaming around enjoying their holidays.
