THE arrival of Sipho Mbule, Luther Singh, and Teboho Mokoena in the South Africa's Under-23 team was a huge boost for coach David Notoane. All these players missed the opening group game where SA were held to a goalless draw by Zambia on Saturday evening however, they have made their presence felt on their first game in Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The trio were thrown straight into the starting line-up as the South Africans aimed for maximum points and they did not disappoint as they helped the team collect maximum points defeating Ivory Coast 1-0 at the Al Salam Stadium on Tuesday evening. Mokoena's well taken free kick was enough to hand South Africa Maximum points on the day. It was a close encounter with both teams attacking each other. It looked like the game would end in a draw until the 79 minute where Singh was fouled just outside the box and they were awarded a set piece. Having scored from that similar position in the PSL, Mokoena made no mistake with a brilliantly taken free-kick which went in off the crossbar. South Africans pushed for a second later on, but Kobamelo Kodisang effort was denied by the crossbar in the final minute of the match as the encounter finished 1-0. The Young Bafana are now top of their Group B with four points from two matches. On Friday they will face Nigeria in the last group match. They need to finish in the top two to qualify for the semi finals, and top three in the tournament to book their flight ticket to next years Olympic Games in Japan.
