BORI NG nightlife received a long-awaited boost yesterday when officials announced an end to rules limiting where and when people could drink alcohol. New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced pubs’ trading hours would be extended and laws curbing after-midnight drinking would be eased in most of central Sydney. “We need to ensure we have a strong and vibrant night-time economy that reflects our position as Australia’s only truly global city,” said Berejiklian. For a city famed for its New Year’s Eve parties, Sydney is surprising dead at night. Under “lock-out laws”, bar doors close at 01.30am, there are restrictions on serving cocktails, shots or drinks in glass after midnight, and bouncers and police hover over proceedings.–NEWS24
