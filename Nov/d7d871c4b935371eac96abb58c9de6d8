As a professional who qualified in the mid-1990s, Xolani Gwala carried with him the values of our transition to democracy – the values of listening and being open to views that conflict with or offend your own, and a focus on solution," Ramaphosa said. The Presidency announced that Gwala's special provincial funeral would also involve ceremonial elements by the South African Police Service. The Radio 702 talk show host was remembered in multiple memorial services this week that were attended by veteran journalists, peers, politicians and listeners of the radio station. Among those who spoke of Gwala's humility and calm nature was Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Gwala’s close friend and fellow broadcaster Robert Marawa, and his close confidante advocate Muzi Sikhakhane.
