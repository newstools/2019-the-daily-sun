STRIKING unions are ready to shut down aviation. After a meeting between SAA, Numsa and the South African Cabin Crew Association at the CCMA was unsuccessful on Saturday, unions announced their strike would be entering its fourth day on Monday.  Speaking on behalf of the two unions, Numsa spokeswoman, Phakamile Hlubi said they are workers were going to intensify the strike to protect jobs. She said Numsa was consulting with employees of companies like Mango, the Civil Aviation Authority, Comair and catering companies to join them. “We already have a strike certificate with Comair. We are ready to shut down aviation if they don’t clean up SAA. We are not going to be sacrificed for the failures and mismanagement of state-owned entities,” said Hlubi.  She said if the Civil Aviation Authority went on strike, no aircraft would be taking off or landing. She said one of the crucial issues was SAA refusing to commit to insourcing.  “Insourcing will save the airline,” said Hlubi. “SAA spends R25 billion a year on procurement. Reports have shown those contracts are dodgy and corrupt.” SAA is expected to resume international flights today. It reportedly lost R52 million a day to the strike.
