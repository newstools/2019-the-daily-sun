GHANA’s lack of preparation for their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier blockbuster with Bafana Bafana could work in favour of the opposition. That is the view of the Black Stars captain Dede Ayew ahead of their opening qualifier encounter at Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday (7pm). Ayew stressed that they have not played together as a team for a long time and that could give Bafana the edge. “It is different than usual. We are playing on Thursday and the days for the preparation are shorter,” Ayew told journalists during Ghana’s training in Accra on Monday. “We haven’t played together as a team for a while. In the past international week, we did not have any game and that could make things hard for us.” The Swansea City star added: “But it is no excuse. Our job is to make sure we get the three points at home.” In June, the two nations played to a goalless draw in their international friendly played behind closed doors in Dubai. Ayew believes their group is not as easy as it looks. He said: “It is a tough group. We have played Sudan and we have also met South Africa a lot of times. Every team have qualities. "But at the end of the day, we have great players people who want to die for the nation" “We are here to give everything to the nation it will be difficult, but we will go through. We know this tournament; we were unlucky in Egypt losing ion the penalties.”
