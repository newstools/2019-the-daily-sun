The workers said one person was wounded in the hand. Cops arrested a guard. Potsane said: “We urge Prasa to respect us and stop ignoring us when we demand our money.” Potsane said workers hadn’t received their salaries for last month. He said they’d sleep outside the station until they got their money. Enlightened Security Company worker Emily Sono (49) said: “We can’t work without salaries. We haven’t paid our rent and we don’t have food.” Prasa spokeswoman Nana Zenani said the workers were employees of companies contracted to Prasa and their contracts ended last month. “The companies were informed as early as June. These contracts were deemed irregular by a special investigative unit report,” she said.
