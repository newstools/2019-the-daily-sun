Colonel Christelle Stemmet, who was shot and killed at her
home in Table View on Sunday night, was leading probes into major corruption
scandals at state-owned petrochemical company PetroSA.  But the 47-year-old's sudden death as a result of fatal
gunshot wounds may delay cases she had finally brought to court after years of
investigation.  The first leg of one of her PetroSA cases was due to be
before the Belville Magistrate's Court this Friday. It is unclear if the matter
will be able to proceed without Stemmet, the investigating officer, being
present.  Zuma-linked lawyer Geroge Sabelo and former PetroSA chief
executive Yekani Tenza were due to appear before the court on charges of fraud
or theft, News24 reported on Sunday.  Stemmet worked for the Western Cape Serious Corruption
Investigations unit of the Hawks, and was involved in a number of major investigations.  According to Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Philani
Nkwalase, Stemmet was shot twice and died on the scene at her home in Cape
Town.  Netwerk24 reported that two spent bullet casings were found
on the scene, but the murder weapon had not been recovered.  A friend of Stemmet reportedly contacted the police
following the shooting.  Nkwalase, in a statement issued on Monday, said the motive
for the shooting was under investigation by local detectives, however
preliminary investigations had ruled out any links to Stemmet's investigations
for the Hawks.  "An inquest docket has been opened to explore the
circumstances surrounding the death of such a seasoned and dedicated
officer," the statement read.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/shooting-of-top-hawks-cop-may-affect-delay-major-petrosa-corruption-cases-20191111
