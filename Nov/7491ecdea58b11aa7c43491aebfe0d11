BEING a troubled child taught Dikarabo Kotsokoane life lessons. At the age of 16 she was pregnant and HIV positive. The 22-year-old University of Pretoria financial science student said she began having sex at the age of 14. “I never thought one day I’d be living with HIV. I thought I was smart but life showed me otherwise.” When she found out she was pregnant, her boyfriend pushed her to have an abortion. “I didn’t know what he was trying to tell me until I couldn’t terminate and had to start my antenatal care.” She was six months pregnant when a gynaecologist told her she was HIV positive. “I was with my mum. I was in shock, angry at myself and couldn’t deal with the stress.” She gave birth a month later. but took control of her life. “I started to educate myself about the virus and realised it was not a death sentence. “I forgave myself and made a promise to work hard not to let it define me.” With the help of friends and family, she accepted her status and began a journey to help other young people. “I realised people don’t have the same support, so I started a foundation where I reached out to young people who needed help,” she said.
