WHEN the councillor apparently registered Doris Mthiyane and others for RDPs, she hoped better days were coming. Three years later, the 54-year-old from Nkundusi in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, is still living in a mud house she fears will bury her alive. Doris said the only thing she received, an ANC T-shirt, could not stop her house from collapsing. HE DIED ON THE SPOT! “The councillor promised us that RDPs would be built,” she said. “Later, he said we’d no longer get houses as they were being built in other areas.” Doris said she just needed a safe home for her and her unemployed son Fihlamahlazo (30). “We’d even appreciate a two-roomed mudhouse as we don’t have privacy. I can’t bath in front of my son,” she said. “The problem is that we’re both unemployed and can’t afford to buy building materials.” MBUYISENI CALLED TO ORDER! Doris said they don’t even have food and go around the village begging. “I can’t even get a job as I don’t have a matric certificate,” she said. “My parents died while I was in grade 3 and I had to drop out to work on a sugarcane farm.” Doris appealed to good Samaritans to help with building materials, clothes and food parcels. Councillor Vincent Madonsela said no one was registered for RDPs. The municipality only profiled households. “The housing department announced each of the six wards would get 100 houses,” said Modonsela. “As councillors, we had to profile 100 poor families. We did that and it’s a long process. “Building has started in other wards and it’s still coming to my ward. People need to be patient.”
