 One of
Durban's main highways has been closed following flooding, the city's metro
police said on Monday. The M4
northern freeway between Umhlanga and Sibaya was closed, Durban Metro Police
spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad said. "This
is as a result of flooding. It will be closed for an unknown period of time. We
have reached out to the Department of Transport's engineers to assess the
damage so far. I don't think the road will be opened today." He said
alternate routes were the M41, N2 and the R102.  Many other
parts of the city - including Verulam, Amanzimtoti, Chatsworth and other low
lying areas - were affected by the rains. Pictures
and videos circulating online show extensive damage to property and vehicles. Rescue Care
spokesperson Garrith Jamieson cautioned motorists to drive carefully.  "There
is flooding on multiple roadways. Rescue services and ambulances are on
standby." Disaster
management teams in the province were placed on high alert on Sunday, following
reports of severe thunderstorms. Teams were
placed on alert after the South African Weather Service (SAWS) indicated a
strong possibility of severe thunderstorms that could lead to localised
flooding in large parts of the province. Recently,
four people were killed after a lightning strike in Mkhuze in northern
KwaZulu-Natal.
