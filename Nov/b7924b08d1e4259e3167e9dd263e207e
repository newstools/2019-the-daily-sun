 One of
Durban's main highways has been closed following flooding, the city's metro
police said on Monday. The M4
northern freeway between Umhlanga and Sibaya was closed, Durban Metro Police
spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad said. "This
is as a result of flooding. It will be closed for an unknown period of time. We
have reached out to the Department of Transport's engineers to assess the
damage so far. I don't think the road will be opened today." He said
alternate routes were the M41, N2 and the R102. PICS: Durban has one again hit by localised flooding and heavy rains. @TeamNews24 @News24 pic.twitter.com/clIIxfRPB0  Many other

is flooding on multiple roadways. Rescue services and ambulances are on

management teams in the province were placed on high alert on Sunday, following
reports of severe thunderstorms. Teams were
placed on alert after the South African Weather Service (SAWS) indicated a
strong possibility of severe thunderstorms that could lead to localised
flooding in large parts of the province. Recently,
four people were killed after a lightning strike in Mkhuze in northern
KwaZulu-Natal.
