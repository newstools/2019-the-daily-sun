SPRINGBOKS coach Rassie Erasmus displayed a sad picture in his face when asked about his decision to step down as coach following their success at the World Cup. He described his departure as “sad” for both himself and the players and also indicated that he was proud of the growth shown by his troops over the past year. Erasmus was speaking at the Playhouse in Durban on Sunday where he walked away with the Coach of the year accolade at the 2019 SA Sport Awards. The 47-year-old who was also named coach of the year at the World Rugby Awards recently, is set to resume his full time role as the director of South Africa Rugby Union (Saru). “It is sad in the way that I won’t be there every single day on the field,” said Erasmus. “But I’ll always be around the team. The director of rugby job doesn’t mean I’ll be sitting in the office, I’ll be part of the planning for all kinds of things.” Erasmus revealed that the promise shown by his side leading into the World Cup, is what kept him in the role for as long as he stayed. “It was nice to see players worked, players grow, team doing well,” Erasmus added. “So we all know if the team didn’t do well, the coaches didn’t do well, I wouldn’t stand here and lift this trophy.”
