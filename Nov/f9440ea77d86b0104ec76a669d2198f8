LAST week there was talk by refugees of walking to the Namibian border. Daily Sun this week spoke to the group that couldn’t force government or the United Nations to repatriate them. They said it would be better to be reintegrated into their former communities. Adam Kohozo (56) from the DRC said he couldn’t imagine his kids, wife and elderly mother walking to the border. “It’s better to go back to Mitchells Plain where I was staying and find something to do there.” For more than a month hundreds of refugees held sit-ins at the offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Cape Town before they were taken to the church they are occupying. Refugee Frankie Odoyi (27) said he regretted leaving his job at the takeaway where he worked as a cook. “When I heard people were gathering here I thought I may get a better chance of going overseas, so I left my job. We’re packed in at this church and people are getting sick. I don’t want this anymore.” Frankie said he might go to Joburg. But leader JP Balous insisted they were leaving South Africa for good. Said Shamir Mahomed from Somalia: “This is our last week in South Africa. Walking doesn’t scare me. I’ve walked before. “I just want a place to stay in peace and look after my children.”
