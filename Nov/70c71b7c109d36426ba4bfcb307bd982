Ramaphosa said 18 companies that were engaged to set up operations in the economic zone were ready to go. He said nine had already confirmed to set up factories by 2021.  “It takes a lot of doing to create a single job, and here in this place we are going to create those jobs, and that fills me with pride. “This is what we’ve been talking about since last year, saying we want to get investors so that we can create jobs,” he said. Ramaphosa said the initiative was proof that partnerships between government and the private sector were vital in driving the development agenda of our country. Tshwane mayor Stevens Mokgalapa said the purpose of the hub was to help the country attract new automotive manufacturers while strengthening the City of Tshwane’s position.
