JUST months after becoming the first black African woman to climb Everest, Saray Khumalo is already preparing for her next challenge. She will be participating in the Grand Slam expedition, which will see her visiting the north and south poles and climbing the highest peaks on seven continents.  And once again, Saray is putting her body on the line for a greater purpose. She told Daily Sun: “I’m going to be climbing for Ed for All, which aims to educate 300 students who qualify for degrees but can’t afford it. I’m hoping to raise R4,5 million.” Saray said she would be leaving for her next challenge in three weeks and thanked Momentum Multiply for partnering with her to make it possible. At the announcement event held in Fourways, Joburg, yesterday, reporters were given a taste of her experience climbing Everest with virtual reality. Saray said she failed to reach the top during her first attempt in 2017, but that didn’t stop her from going back earlier this year.
