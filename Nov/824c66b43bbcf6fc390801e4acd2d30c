HE knew he was seeing a girl from the wrong hostel and the girl warned him he was in danger. But Ayabonga Nomana (16) visited his 17-year-old girlfriend anyway. On Friday, the grade 10 pupil from Moeletsi Hostel in Welkom, Free State, was apparently hacked to death by a group of young men from G-Hostel. The two hostels are only metres apart. According to residents of both hostels, the turf war between the teenagers started a month ago. A teenage boy from Moeletsi hostel said: “We don’t allow boys from the other hostel to date girls from our hostel.” Witness Palesa Mohlubing said: “I was on my way home when I saw a group of armed boys running towards Ayabonga. “They assaulted him before hacking him. “I heard one of them saying ‘stay away from our ladies!’ before they fled.” Ayabonga’s devastated girlfriend said: “The two groups have been fighting over girls. “Boys from my hostel told me the day before Ayabonga was killed they were watching him. “I warned him to stop seeing me but he refused. He wasn’t a gang member. He was killed because he lived in a different hostel.” Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the anti-gang unit arrested nine teenagers aged between 16 and 19 years for murder. The cops spokesman said: “Police confiscated dangerous weapons such as wooden sticks, sjamboks, knives and sharp objects. “None of the boys belong to any of the gangs. “There’s no evidence of what the motive for the fight was.” “The suspects will appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court soon.” Makhele said the rest of the suspects were still on the run and would be arrested.
