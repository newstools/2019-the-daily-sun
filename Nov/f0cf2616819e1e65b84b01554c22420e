IT’S exactly two years since Lebogang Manyama made an appearance for Bafana Bafana. But he could make a return to the international fold in far away Ghana tonight. And how fitting would it be for the Kaizer Chiefs striker to complete his comeback from a dark period of his football career, should he feature for Bafana in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ghana in Cape Coast. Manyama endured a terrible year spell at Turkish side Konyaspor. And just as he was relishing a return back home, he suffered a car crash. His setback was further compounded by injuries upon his recovery. But he is back and looking to pick up from where he left off against Senegal in the contentious 2018 World Cup qualifier exctly two years ago. “I’m happy to be back after such today a long time with all the problems I had,” said Manyama. “It’s part of life. You never give up but keep going. I’ve been working hard to help the team and get myself to the level where I was before the injury, also hoping to get back to Bafana.” Against Ghana, Manyama couldn’t have asked for a tougher return to international football. Bafana are looking for a perfect start to their qualifier campaign. “Away games are always tough in Africa, but we’ve played in tough places,” Manyama said. “Everyone’s up for it. I don’t see it as mission impossible. The conditions have never easy. We have to be strong mentally, not to think about many other factors, but just the game.”
