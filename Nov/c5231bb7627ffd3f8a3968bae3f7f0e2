FANELESIBONGE Mbatha’s daughter is back! Nontando Mbatha (19), a Durban University of Technology student, went missing on 11 November after she left her residence to go shopping at the Davenport Shopping Centre. She returned on 21 November and her mum in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, said she was grateful.  Fanelesibonge said she got a phone call from her daughter’s roommate, telling her Nontando was back but wasn’t healthy. She said she asked them to take her to hospital. “I met her when she was already at Addington Hospital,” she said. “She told me after she left her room, a Hyundai H1 stopped and a woman got out and asked for directions to a supermarket. “The woman acted as if she didn’t understand and asked Nontando to get into the car as it was raining.” She said after she got in the car, the woman sprayed her face with something and she passed out. When she woke up she was inside a house where there were men and women. READ: THE TERROR OF A CAT TAXI DRIVER! Fanelesibonge didn’t want to share with Daily Sun what they did to her daughter. “She told me one of the men told her he’d kill her but instead put her in the boot of the car and dumped her near the residence,” she said. Fanelesibonge said Nontando was recovering but she thought it would take time for her daughter to get over what had happened. When Daily Sun asked to speak to her, the mum said she was with relatives. Nontando’s cellphone was off. KZN cops spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed Nontando was found alive and said police were still investigating.
