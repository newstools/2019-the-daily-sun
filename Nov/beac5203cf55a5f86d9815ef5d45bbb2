THE Emfuleni Municipality has been dealing with a number of corruption scandals recently. But its political leaders say not all the municipality’s officials are dishonest. Speaker Maipato Tsokolibane blamed incompetence for irregular expenditure that has affected the council for years. Tsokolibane yesterday addressed the media on a forensic report compiled by Comperio Consulting, which details how R872 million was misspent on tenders. The report says officials allegedly awarded tenders for security, fleet lease and cellphones irregularly. “I pity the officials who are implicated in this report. Some of them are not corrupt, it’s just a matter of competency,” she said. “Some stole, but the majority of them were not complying. Some of these departments need people with expertise.” The report found that Mafoko Security, which had a security contract for two years, was paid more than R57 million after its contract extension last year. In June 2006 and September 2007, the municipality and Vaal Toyota signed two five-year contracts for supply and maintenance of 70 cars but investigators couldn’t find evidence that 19 of the cars were delivered.
