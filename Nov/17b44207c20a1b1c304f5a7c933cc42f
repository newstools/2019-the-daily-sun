THE showdown between pastors and gospel artists again provided great entertainment. The soccer match was held at George Campbell High School in Durban as a buildup to the SABC Crown Gospel Music Awards on Sunday. PICS: KHUNE'S MAKOTI! The artists rose to the challenge and beat the Durban pastors 2-1. Nzimande brothers, Dumi “Mkokstad” and Thulani scored two goals. Dumi said they’ve been holding a holy grudge against the pastors. “We had a good game. The pastors played very well but we were more prepared. “After they defeated us on penalties last year, we went back to the drawing board. CHABALALA’S SECRET WEDDING! “We came with one intention and that was to defeat them.” Bishop Vusi Dube said they were defeated with respect. “They humbled us. They played good soccer but it does not change the fact that we defeated them last year and will defeat them again next year. In the same breath, I’d like to wish the nominated artists all the luck for Sunday.” Awards founder Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule told SunBuzz: “We are happy artists and pastors delivered their best during the games. On Thursday, we’ll have a march against women and child abuse called Crown Prayer Walk from King Dinuzulu Road to City Hall, open to everyone.” Tickets for the awards cost R350 general and R1980 for VIP through Computicket.
