NOVEMBER is World Diabetes Month and Thursday – 14 November – was World Diabetes Day. The month and day are celebrated globally to educate people about the disease and to increase awareness of the complications it poses. This year’s theme, Family and Diabetes, focuses on raising awareness of the impact diabetes has on families. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to helping prevent or delay life-threatening complications. If type 1 diabetes is not detected early, it can lead to serious disability or death. Type 1 diabetes is usually caused by an auto-immune reaction. This is when the body’s defence system attacks the cells that produce insulin. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little or no insulin. The disease may affect people of any age, but it usually develops in children or young adults. People with this form of diabetes need injections of insulin to control the levels of glucose in their blood. Type 1 diabetes may cause unplanned weight loss, nausea and vomiting. Type 2 diabetes used to be called non-insulin dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes. The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes can occur at any age and may remain undetected for many years. The diagnosis is often made when a complication appears or a routine blood or urine glucose test is done. It is often, but not always, associated with being overweight or obese, which itself can contribute to insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes characterised by high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. It develops in one in 25 pregnancies worldwide and is associated with complications to both mother and baby. It usually disappears after pregnancy but women with it and their children are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
