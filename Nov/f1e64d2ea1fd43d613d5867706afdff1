We have seen the like of Rihanna, Kendall Jenner and other well known celebrities rock these shoes and now the girls next door to us have access to the replicas of the shoes. Yesterday, Bonang Matheba took to Social Media to express that she has been seeing a lot of these shoes and wonders if Amina Muaddi is aware. A lot of people were even surprised to find out that the shoes are designer. Amina Muaddi is a Paris-based, Italian-raised designer behind her namesake brand and has long been one of the people's favourite Italian influencer to watch out for at fashion week. Muaddi creates a silhouette in her heels that is now instantly recognisable: The heels of her shoes flare out to creating a unique architectural effect but also an extremely comfortable base.

Almost every blogger and influencer in SA has posed in this shoe, hence everyone is flocking for the replicas of it without even knowing. Rapper Nadia Nakai was also recently spotted wearing the very same pair shoes for her recent award collection. ????
