If your weekend plans are not coming together- you still stand a chance to party with fabulous people this weekend. It is that time of the year again. Gauteng cup is back with the bang but this week we focus on the much talked marquee; The Vouish Marquee.  Speaking to the owner Mogau Seama who says his secret for a successful marquee is to go big or go home . In its 3rd successful year, The Theme for this year is Bonny and Clyde and promises nothing short of “Luxury”, Mogau says for the first time this year they are in partnership with Pharaoh Auto Investment which is synonymous with a prime selection of luxury investment vehicles, a partnership with some the best fashion design houses who will be doing a glam fashion installation and experience. “We’ve also take the entertainment a notch up by booking some of the big names like Zakes Bantwini, Major League to name a few,” he adds. To the fashion slayers don’t worry red carpet will be long enough to provide good camera angles. “A 20 meter step and repeat Red carpet will be one of the greatest feature also. The Marquee Décor and styling will be executed by Guay Interiors in collaboration with the Pillow Fluffer,” he adds.
