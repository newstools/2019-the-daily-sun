POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has come out guns blazing against officers who go out on dates in cop cars. He said at the launch of the safer festive season campaign on Friday cops chilled with girls under trees in police cars. “I’m told they chill until they put their feet outside the windows,” he said. He said that was unacceptable. “State cars are not for charming women. They should never be used for anything other than serving the community,” he said. Cele said people should not get into state cars if cops approached them. “Tell him to go back and come in his own car,” said Cele. He said girls’ parents even asked to be taken somewhere in state cars. “It’s wrong,” said Cele. He said people should start working with cops to fight crime. “Criminals don’t fall from the sky like rain. They come from your homes,” he said. “They’re your brothers, uncles and lovers. I want to start an operation, Bring Your Own Criminal. People should drag their criminals to police stations. “Recently, we arrested a gogo who hid guns in her house and protected her grandsons. This must stop. Stop hiding criminals and bring them to us.” Cele said thugs wore patrollers’ uniforms in Joburg. “They pretend to be out there to help people but end up robbing them. We’ll find them. From now on we’ll vet all patrollers,” he said. Cele told cops that when a woman reported domestic violence, they shouldn’t tell her to sort things out at home. “Open a case because next time she won’t come back as she’ll be dead,” he said.
