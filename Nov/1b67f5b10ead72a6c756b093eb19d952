Rape accused madala will remain behind
bars until his case is finalised. The 70-year-old wasn’t asked to plead
when he appeared before Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba at Mhala Magistrates Court in
Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga on Friday. Madala is being accused of raping a
4-year-old girl last month and his bail application was denied after the court
heard the evidence of Investigating Officer Detective Constable Isabella Sibuyi
that he would interfere with the state witness. His arrest came last month after the
victim complained about pains between her legs, telling her aunt that the
accused penetrated her. It is reported the victim together with
her friends were last seen playing with the accused at an abandoned house where
madala was looking after his goat while it was grazing. “We opposed his release and if he
remains in police custody, state witness will be safe and not be intimidated,”
Constable Sibuyi told the court. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba denied the
accused bail and postponed the case until 30 January for further police
investigations.
