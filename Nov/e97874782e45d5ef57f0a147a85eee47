DEPUTY minister of human settlements, water and sanitation, David Mahlobo, said old and rotten pipes are causing clean water to flood into the streets. He said his department would have to invest in revamping the system to win the war on leaks. Addressing parliament’s portfolio committee on water and sanitation yesterday, he said: “The assets are old. They have reached a point where they should be replaced. “If you’re going to have thousands of kilometres of asbestos pipelines that are as old as 50 or 70 years in certain townships, the water is going to be on the streets.” Mahlobo was answering MPs’ questions on the progress of the department’s war on leaks programme. The department’s director-general, Mbulelo Tshangana, said water was a critical issue in the country and people needed to use it wisely. He said the department had trained thousands of young people to run water awareness programmes. “The annual average rainfall in this country is sitting at 50ml, which is below the global average of 860ml. This means we have to tell South Africans to use water sparingly,” said Tshangana. “This is what we are going to do with young people. “We’re going to teach them to do advocacy work around the water conversation.”
