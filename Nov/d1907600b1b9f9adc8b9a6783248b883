TOP Post Office officials told Parliament the organisation had not made a profit for the past 13 years. They appeared before the Portfolio Committee on Communications yesterday, explaining their plans to turn the organisation around. “The Post Office has not been profitable for the past 13 years, except in 2006 when a profit of R276 million was made. “This excluded the subsidy received for the public service mandate,” said acting CEO Lindiwe Kwele. She said the organisation was also crippled by strikes in recent years, which led to an R800 million loss of revenue. Chief financial officer Jabulani Dlamuka said the other challenge they faced was the depletion of infrastructure, some of which was outdated. Dlamuka said a lot needed to be done to fix outdated and depleted infrastructure that prevented the Post Office from being competitive. “There has been infrastructure neglect. We are using old technology. “The focus was that when we got the funding, we ring-fence some of the money so we upgrade and bring some status to our infrastructure,” said Dlamuka. He said people had lost confidence in their services and they were working on turning that around. “We want to bring back the lost market. There is undoubted lack of confidence from our consumers and to turn that around, we need to put proper infrastructure,” he said.
