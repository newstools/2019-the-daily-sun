It’s that time of year again. Black Friday is here, the festive season is starting in earnest, and you’ll soon be blasted with messages telling you to spend your hard-earned money. Well, this happens throughout the rest of the year too, but as soon as November rolls on the pressure feels especially present. According to Karmen Wessels of Sanlam Indie, you must remember that when you put your money into a savings account, the aim is usually to leave it there for a while and grow it towards a goal. “This isn’t the money in your emergency fund. Depending on the kind of savings account you have, the money in that account could earn some interest, which means your money creates more money at the end of each day, month or year”. Karmen said if you have a savings account with an interest rate of 10%, and you put R1 000 into it. At the end of the year that 10% takes your R1 000, and makes a bonus R100. So now you’ve got R1 100. “So now you have two options, to withdraw and spend or leave it and let compound interest do the work of growing your money,” she said. Karmen said the sooner you start saving and compounding that interest, the bigger the pay-off will be later in life. “Why buy a tropical print Speedo now, when you can buy an island in the tropics in a few years time instead?”, she asked. The key here is money mindfulness . . . stop and think about what you really want to do with your money. Don’t get pulled into the peer pressure of spending everything on slightly discounted items just because a flashy advertisement told you a deal is once in a lifetime. If you need something, save up for it. If you don’t, then save it and let compound interest grow your wealth for a really meaningful goal further down the line.
