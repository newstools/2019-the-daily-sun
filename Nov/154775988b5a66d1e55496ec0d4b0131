 MARIUS Phala found a hand, two fingers and an ear at his gate. There was also a short note written in broken in English and a kettle filled with muthi and chicken feathers, sparking fear among community members. The 37-year-old Marius fled the kasi in fear for his life. Daily Sun published the story on Thursday under the headline: “Body parts at my gate.”  On Saturday residents of Lethabong, Tshwane, went on the rampage in search of people suspected to be responsible for the gruesome crime. Two suspects were attacked in their homes but they fled to the police station, where they allegedly confessed to killing a man and dumping his body parts at Marius’ gate. According to Boschkop police spokesman Constable Yeroboam Mbatsane, it turned out two men were in love with the same woman from their kasi. One of them was murdered and his body parts dumped at Marius’ gate to send a message to the woman. A resident said it was well-known that the woman was in love with two men, who would bump into each other while visiting her. She said the men would often get into verbal fights and threaten each other. “What the men did was gruesome. How could you mutilate a person like that for love? We hope they get life in prison,” she said. Marius returned to the kasi but the woman hasn’t. Marius said he was relieved the suspects were arrested but sad a man had lost his life. He refused to confirm if his relative was in a love triangle. Mbatsane said the suspects, aged 29 and 33, would be charged with murder and intimidation. They were expected to appear in the Cullinan Magistrates Court today.
