A GREAT turn out as KwaMashu residents came out to see their Rugby players this morning. The residents which included pupils, adults and even amaphara gathered in Malandela Road in KwaMashu Shopping centre. They were singing and chanting songs as they wait for the team. And when they finally arrived they screamed and cheered for the team. Some shouted "Here comes our team! Our heroes the best team in the whole world We love you!" as the bus drove pass in the Malandela Road. Msawakhe Khumalo (42) from Ntuzuma north of Durban said he arrived at 7am to wait for the Rugby team. And he doesn't regret his decision because he finally saw them. "I cheered at them and showed them love. They made me proud," he said. And 47-year-old Buyi Mchunu (47) said she wanted to see Siya Kolosi and indeed she saw him.

Im a big fan of Siya Kolosi," The team had started in Umhlanga in the morning and they arrived KwaMashu Malandela Road and they are now heading to the Durban City hall.
