“WE cannot defeat Kaizer Chiefs and end up not winning the Telkom Knockout!” Could Judas Moseamedi be excessively confident ahead Maritzburg United’s TKO final against Mamelodi Sundowns at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium on 14 December? “But why not,” he asked when quizzed about the two goals he scored against Amakhosi in their 2-1 Knockout semi-final at Nelspruit’s Mbombela Stadium on Sunday. “I am very happy,” Moseamedi said yesterday. “Every game is a cup match for us. It has always been like this. And this is not the first time that I have scored very important goals like these. “I did that last year against SuperSport United. This is my strength that I act when it matters the most, like the game against Chiefs. I would be happy if we were to do the same to Sundowns (in the final).” He said their game plan was very superior against Chiefs and heaped praise on his coaching staff of head coach, Eric Tinkler and his assistant Vincent Kobola. “We need to carry on and show that we are not in this final by pure luck. The 2-1 win could have been more had we utilised all the chances that we created, or had an extra few minutes.” He said the two goals will go down in history in his career, scoring the two goals that saw Chiefs out of a cup tournament. In fact, Chiefs were favouries to win this one considering their form in the league. “Memorable goals for me,” said Moseamedi after yesterday’s training session in Nelspruit before leaving for Maritzburg where they have SuperSport United in the Absa Premiership at the Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow. “Every one in camp is now motivated. But we need to come down to earth and face the reality of the league. We are a happy lot today and we will think of the final when it comes.”
