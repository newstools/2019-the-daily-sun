MZWANELE Manyi admitted to asking Jacob Zuma to intervene on his behalf. The former Government Communication and Information Systems CEO told the Zondo Commission he asked ex-president Zuma to step in after he was put on precautionary leave by then labour minister Membathisi Mdladlana. Manyi said he was aware at the time that Mdladlana had made a decision to fire him but argued the former minister had no powers to dismiss him. He said Mdladlana would need Zuma’s approval to dismiss him. Asked by evidence leader Advocate Kate Hofmeyr whether he approached Zuma to intervene, Manyi first said he’d have probably written a letter to Zuma. But he later said: “Yes, I approached the president.” Manyi said he approached everybody. “The president was my employer, after all,” responded Manyi when pressed further. A letter of intervention from the presidency was read into the records even though Manyi said he wasn’t aware of it. Manyi admitted he had a good relationship with Zuma but denied any relations with the Gupta brothers, even though he said he knew them. “Zuma is a very friendly person who has good relations with many people, and I was one of them,” he said. At the time Manyi was on precautionary leave, Mdladlana was replaced by Mildred Oliphant. Manyi made efforts to contact her. The two later met formally to discuss his situation. A few weeks later Oliphant withdrew Manyi’s leave. This was at the same time that former GCIS boss Themba Maseko was being redeployed. He was replaced by Manyi.
