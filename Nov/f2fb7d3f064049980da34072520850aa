THE French-South African Agricultural Institute was launched at Limpopo University Wednesday. It’s a partnership between France, Limpopo, Fort Hare and Venda universities. The institute aims to address food security and rural development challenges in the country. French ambassador Aurelien Lechevallier said the French government last year dedicated about R5,5 million to kick-start co-operative projects at the universities. “The government aimed to produce a curriculum in food science and to increase the number of students in the agricultural sector.” The institute was established in 2013. “The aim was to boost capacity building at South African universities and research institutes in the agricultural as well as food sectors through research programmes and students and lecturer training.” He said the co-operation between the French government and Mzansi in agriculture, food science and higher education would go a long way. Lechevallier said the institute had trained 80 students so far. University of Limpopo deputy vice-chancellor for innovation and partnerships, Jesika Singh, said the university would offer a top level degree in food science and agribusiness.
