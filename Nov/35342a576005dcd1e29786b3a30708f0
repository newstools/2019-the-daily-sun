The rape allegedly took place at the pastor’s home in Acornhoek on 29 October after he offered to pray for the woman. Phororo pleaded not guilty to a charge of raping the social worker. Prosecutor Moses Sibanda said the accused raped the victim inside his house on the night of 29 October. “According to the victim’s statement, she started dating the accused in early October on Facebook, and before her visit to the pastor’s house there was an agreement that no sex would take place when she visited,” Sibanda said. WOMAN REVEALS SHE SLEPT WITH MORE THAN 100 INSTAGRAM STRANGERS Phororo’s lawyer, Owen Mnisi, said: “He’s not a flight risk and won’t interfere with the police investigation. “The complainant is back home in Gauteng, so he needs to be released.” Magistrate Vicey Marule said the accused was facing a serious charge. “You might get a harsh sentence if found guilty,” said Marule. “After careful consideration of the evidence before court, you’re therefore granted R500 bail.” The pastor’s case was postponed to 14 January for further investigation.
