HOME Affairs chairman Bongani Bongo said he will allow justice to take its course. In his opening remarks at the portfolio committee of Home Affairs that he chairs, he said he is innocent until proven otherwise. Bongo was questioned by Hawks last week but was released on the same day. “I will go to court and prove my innocence. Whatever the outcome of the court will be binding to me and my conscience,” Bongo said. The former minister of state security under former president Jacob Zuma’s administration is accused of attempting to bribe advocate Nthuthuzelo Vanara, who was the evidence leader of the parliamentary inquiry into the state capture. ANC MP Mosa Chabane said their position is that Bongo is innocent until proven guilty as the constitution prescribes. “We rely on the neutrality of the Constitution that you remain innocent until proven otherwise,” said Chabane. During the meeting the parliamentary bells that has a siren-like sound went off and DA’s MP Joe McGluwa took an opportunity to throw a jab at Bongo by saying they got scared when the bells went off thinking it was cops’ siren. “I thought it was the police coming in here,” he laughed.
