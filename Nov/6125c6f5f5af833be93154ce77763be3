MARITZBURG United thought of sacking coach Eric Tinkler when the results weren’t forthcoming. But their chairman, Farouk Kadodia, knowing how fickle the industry is, as it is driven by results, he stuck with the former Cape Town City coach. Tinkler was going through the trying times and in the first five league matches of the season, Maritzburg had lost three and drew the other. At that time, Maritzburg provincial rivals AmaZulu had sacked Cavin Johnson after five games. Johnson’s stats that time was the same as Maritzburg’s. AmaZulu had lost three and drawn two.But it is worth noting that Tinkler retained  Maritzbuirg’s PSL status last season after finishing second from bottom. They did it in style, becoming the first team in the PSL history to win all four games in the Play-offs. “I think with my experience in football, you got to be patience and know how to manage the situation and environment with the coaches,” said Kadodia. Eventually, Maritzburg turned the corner. After beating Chippa United 1-0 on the 27 September, they then defeated Bidvest Wits in the Telkom Knockout Last-16 on penalty shoot out 3-1 after the game ended 1-1 after 120 minutes. Maritzburg are now unbeaten in the last seven matches in all competitions, including a come from behind 2-2 draw in the Absa Premiership match against Bloemfontein Celtic on Friday. Salvaging that draw, the Team of Choice are unbeaten on a Friday game to now 17. They last lost at home on a Friday match was in 2017. Kaizer Chiefs now stand in their way to make history as they will tackle Amakhosi in the TKO semi finals at Mbombela Stadium next week. “I believed that Eric will take us out of the problem. We knew that we assembled a good squad and it was a matter of time,” Kadodia added. “But I think we got a long journey ahead, we still have 20 league games away and I’m sure we’ll do well.”
