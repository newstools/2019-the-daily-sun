SOUTH Africa’s 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup bid remains on track. This was confirmed by Safa acting CEO Gay Mokoena on Thursday as he revealed that the association will be submitting their bid book to Fifa before 13 December deadline day. Mzansi is among the remaining eight associations, who have confirmed their participation in the bidding process for the World Cup. Other associations include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, Korea (expressing interest in a joint bid with DPR Korea) and New Zealand. “Few things fell between the chats, right now we are at the phase where we are negotiating contracts with the hosting cities,” said Mokoena. “Probably the next week we will be finished with that and we will be talking to the government so that the book can be ready by the 13th of December. “The bid book is not yet ready. We need to have a contract with the cities and government. The acting CEO continued: “Government is receptive of our request, but they will still evaluate and see if the tournament makes economic sense for the country then we will take it from there.” Fifa will conduct official inspections of the associations in January and February, with the appointment of the hosts expected to be made in May 2020. Mokoena confidently revealed: “We have the training venues, the stadiums, the hotels and transport. We believe when Fifa comes for introspection in January they’ll be impressed.” The 2023 finals will be the first-ever World Cup edition to feature 32 teams. Banyana Banyana made their World Cup debut in the 2019 finals that were held in France.
