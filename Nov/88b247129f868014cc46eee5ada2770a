Rafiki’s latest hit single Iwewe Yam Le preaches the importance
of respecting women's bodies. The duo that’s made up of Gordon 'King Gee' Netshikweta and Juliano Dlamini said they decided to
make this song because rape culture is growing in South Africa. The song that
features ThackzinDJ and Impande was released last month. Gordon said: “When we decided to do this song we wanted to
spread the message that says ‘No means No’ we believe that when a woman says
no, a man shouldn’t force himself of her. We as men need to learn that a woman’s
body is hers and it should be respected.” The duo said the idea of the song came about when they saw a
video from women from Eswatini singing a song called ‘Iwewe yam le’. “One of our associates went on a trip to Eswatini and he saw
these women singing this song. So he recorded it and showed it to us. We liked it and decided we would make a song out of it and give it a contemporary feel. We then approached Impande and told them about the idea and they wrote more lyrics and we made it a song,” he said. Juju said they are grateful to people for responding well to the song. He said: "People all over Mzansi are singing it and are dancing to it. We are glad they are enjoying it. We hope they'll also learn from it." Rafiki also has a song titled Ke Nyaka Yole featuring Mafikizolo currently out. They released their album, Mboka Mboka in September.
