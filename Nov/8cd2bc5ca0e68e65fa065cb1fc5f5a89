 LOOKING out the bus window they thought they were looking at the promised land. Shack dwellers from Malacca squatter camp in Redhill, north of Durban, told Daily Sun they fell for the cruel trick when they were loaded into a bus and taken to view houses in Cornubia in Verulam that they thought would belong to them. This was before the local government elections in August 2016. But three years later they still find themselves living in the same squatter camp. Local committee member, Siyabulela Dela, told Daily Sun they feel that they’ve been fooled by the eThekwini Municipality.“The happiness we felt when we were told that we were going to be moved to Cornubia is still in our heads, but it brings only anger now,” said Siyabulela. He said they were told that they were going to be moved into the new houses in September 2016. Another member of the local committee, Kholiswa Mlungu, said they only realise now that the houses were never theirs. “It’s sad when politicians play with our minds. They know how much we need proper houses, so they choose to mislead us that way,” said Mlungu. Councillor Peter Graham said residents decided that they didn’t want to move in separate groups but rather go together as one. “This meant they would need to wait for the next phase of Cornubia to be built. Communication wasn’t coming from city officials. I have no control over how they communicate,” said Graham. The residents said they were about 1 000 people and the officials said they’d move only 39 and that’s why they refused.
