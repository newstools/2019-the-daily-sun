A WILDLIFE ranger has recounted his terrifying escape from the clutches of a “particularly cunning” crocodile after wrestling with the reptile and sticking a finger in its eye. Craig Dickmann, who made a split-second decision to go fishing last Sunday in a remote part of Northern Australia known as “croc country”, said a 2,8m crocodile came up from behind him as he was leaving the beach. “As I turned to go, the first thing I see is its head,” Dickmann said. He said the animal latched on to his thigh. “That noise will haunt me forever I think, the sound of the snap of its jaws,” he said. The 54-year-old said he wrestled with the croc on the remote beach as it tried to drag him into the water. He stuck his thumb into its eye, saying it was the only “soft spot” he found on the “bullet-proof” animal. “Their eyes retract a fair way and when you go down far enough you can feel bone so I pushed as far as I possibly could and then it let go at that point,” Dickmann said. After a few minutes, he said he managed to get on top of the croc and pin its jaws shut. He said he then pushed the croc away from him and it slid back into the water. The ranger had skin ripped from his hands and legs in the ordeal and drove more than 45 minutes back to his home before calling emergency services. Queensland’s department of environment euthanised the animal. – NEWS24
