XOLANI Gwala loved helping people while he was alive and this continued even in death. At his memorial service held at the Our Lady of Lourdes Rivonia Catholic Church in Joburg yesterday, mourners were encouraged to make donations to the Teddy Bear Foundation in his name, rather than buying flowers. The broadcaster’s friends, family and colleagues described him as someone who had the spirit of ubuntu. His uncle, Thulezweni Gwala, said: “He grew up in a very cultural home. We brought him up to be respectful and appreciate ubuntu, and we’re happy he lifted the Gwala flag. We are known today because of him.” The Gwalas thanked their makoti, Peggy-Sue Khumalo, for being with him in his final hour. Xolani’s friends including media colleagues said they’d never forget his laugh and he was someone they looked up to. Journalist Thulasizwe Simelane said: “I learnt a lot from him. I always wanted to be like him.” Producer Jonathan Fairbairn said Xolani gave him the name Khabazela. “Working with him was always a great experience. I called him Mphephethwa,” he said. Xolani was described as someone who loved his work but first of all was a family man. Among the mourners were Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s wife Tshepo Motsepe and actress Lillian Dube. The family said another memorial would take place at the 702 offices today and his funeral would be held in his home town of Impendle, KZN, on Saturday.
