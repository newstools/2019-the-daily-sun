FORMER Moroka Swallows legend Steve Sekano is ploughing back to his community in Soweto through his foundation to help youth stay away from drugs and alcohol abuse. Sekano told SunSport that he started the Steve Sekano Foundation in his home kasi of Meadowlands, Soweto, three years ago to help the youth live a clean lifestyle. Sekano is best remembered for helping The Birds finish the PSL season second in 1993 with the likes of Eric Ramasike, Andries Mpondo and the late Manelo Rapelego, where they lost the title on the last day to Mamelodi Sundowns. Said Sekano: “I started a soccer team called Nkanu FC three years ago to help the youth deal with challenges they face in their families on a daily basis. I am also running a development academy from Under-9 to Under-17 to help kids stay away from bad things like drugs and alcohol abuse. I don’t drink nor smoke and that helps to show them how to live a clean lifestyle.” Sekano also runs a tournament in Meadowlands Zone 9 through his foundation to help end poverty. The semi-finals and final will take place tomorrow starting at 9am at Fiat Sports Centre in Meadowlands zone 9.  Nkanu development will take on Motswako FC, while Meadowlands Academy battle it out with Roodepoort Academy in the second match for a place in the final. The winner will get a trophy, gold medals plus R10 000, while runners up get R5 000 and silver medals. “When kids see me they know it’s that time of the tournament and they come in numbers to support knowing they will get food. I also give 100 destitute elderly people food parcels. Even though Waste Group Project has been backing the tournament for the past three years, we need more funds as I also run another tournament for boys and girls, plus netball during Easter holidays. Italian Tile and Ceramic have been supportive as they built classrooms on the pitch to ensure kids do their homework before they start training.”
