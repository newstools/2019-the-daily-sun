With the festive season approaching and more people flocking to the coast, cops have urged people to be safe when swimming. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said they were particularly concerned about kids’ safety near pools, dams and beaches as many had drowned in recent years.  “The most recent incident took place earlier this month when three boys were swimming in the Umkomaas River.

The search and rescue team is searching for his body and a missing persons docket was opened.” Mbele said cops would patrol beaches and pools to ensure people were obeying rules. She said residents should be extra cautious when swimming in the sea. “Swimmers must take time to watch the waves and avoid places where there’s a strong backwash, obvious rip currents, or a danger of being washed onto the rocks,” she said. Mbele said they should also check the weather and tides before leaving their homes as they could be swept away if the sea’s too rough. “Only enter where the waves are gentle. It’s better to swim when the tide is rising as the sea will tend to wash you ashore and the backwash and rip currents are not so strong.” She said they should check with lifeguards on duty what surf conditions were like before entering the sea.

A red flag means it’s dangerous to swim,” she said. “Be considerate of other swimmers. Never swim while you’re drunk. Alcohol impairs judgment and unnecessary risks are taken.”
