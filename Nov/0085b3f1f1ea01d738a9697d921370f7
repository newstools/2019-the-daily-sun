GIANT potholes full of water and mud are a nightmare for motorists and pedestrians alike. Road users said driving on the road is a headache and they end up driving over the pavement to avoid the potholes.  The residents from K section KwaMashu, north of Durban, said they want their councillor to urgently fix the road.

She said the water might be the cause of the potholes. “This is a busy road because buses, taxis and cars use it. I’m sure the councillor is aware of this road because he also drives past here but nothing has been done to fix it,” she said. Another resident, Njabulo Mchunu (32), who is also a driver, he fears his car will bear the brunt of the potholes. “I’m forced to drive through this road daily, I’m afraid eventually my car will be damaged. I’ve seen some motorists damaging their cars because they don’t know how deep these potholes are,” he said. He said some local boys fill the potholes with sand and stones but that doesn’t make a difference because the water keeps coming and makes the potholes worse. “We want the councillor to come and fix this once and for all. If our cars get damaged nobody will pay for us to fix them. This has been bothering us for several years and it should be fixed,” he said.

But I’m working on getting it fixed soon,” he said.
