PAMELA Dube (44) from Joburg drives a white BMW 325i. It brings her attention everywhere she goes. “Whenever I see people on the road, or anywhere nearby, I just rev my car and all eyes will be on me,”said Pamela. Q: What is the aim of doing this? A: I want to make them aware that I’m coming. I don’t hoot, I just rev and the noise makes people aware of my presence. Q: Is it your first car? A: It’s my third. I bought it four years ago. I call it “Respect The Elders”. It’s mostly driven by young people, but when they see me in it they become surprised and want me to rev it more. Q: Why do you love it so much? A: It makes me enjoy life to the fullest. Q: Tell us what you like about this car? A: It’s big. For the fact that it was driven by another woman when I bought it, made me love it more. We went to a garage to buy a car but when we get there, we saw a car dear who was a woman driving the car and revving it a lot. So I asked her to sell the same car to me. Q: Is it your dream car? A: Yes, it is. It’s standard and very low. So, I’m always aware of speed humps. Q: Would you allow another person to drive it? A: No one drives my car. Q: Have you driven any long distance trips? A: I always drive to Rusterburg, North West. I don’t feel the road at all in in this car, thanks to its power. Q: Tell us about your choice of colour? A: White is good and I always wear white clothes whenever I’m behind the wheel. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I don’t have any at the moment. Q: What do you think of other drivers? A: People drive very well on the road, but since it’s now the festive season, people will be taking chances and driving under the influence of alcohol. This is my worry. Drinking and driving is a major problem in this country.
