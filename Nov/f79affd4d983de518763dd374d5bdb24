LIMPOPO Premier Stan Mathabatha’s spokesman has been suspended! Kenny Mathivha was suspended without pay until the end of next month for allegedly defrauding the state of R400 by claiming for trips he didn’t take. According to sources, Mathivha was found guilty of misconduct in April but the matter was delayed. Daily Sun ran the story in June. Mathivha confirmed to have been found guilty during the hearing processes and told to pay R400, but claimed the process was irregular.  “I travelled on 9 April and 10 April, but the claims were confused when I submitted them. The difference was found to be just R400, which I was charged for. I was targeted.” Last year, provincial government spokesman Phuti Seloba was suspended with full pay for allegedly leaking information to opposition parties. He said: “I’m sitting at home without being charged and they don’t want to give reasons.” He’s taken government to the Bargaining Council and if he wins his case, he could be paid millions. Acting spokesman for the provincial government, Mamogo Ntuli confirmed Mathivha’s suspension.  “He underwent a formal disciplinary process, which was chaired by an external chairperson. He’s currently on a two-month suspension. “The office fully complied with the recommendations of the disciplinary committee,” he said. Ntuli confirmed Seloba’s not back a work but didn’t provide details.
