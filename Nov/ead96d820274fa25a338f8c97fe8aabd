AN ANC leader appeared in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court yesterday in connection with a rape charge. The man is accused of raping a 15-year-old girl on 24 October. The man allegedly drugged the girl, took her to his house and raped her. He apparently held the girl hostage for a number of days before letting her go home. A case was opened. The man handed himself over to De Deur police in the south of Joburg. The girl’s mum (33) told Daily Sun she was told by residents that they saw her daughter being driven by the suspect. “I asked her but she hid stuff from me. I asked members of the family to talk to her, and only then did she speak out,” said the mum.  ANC regional treasurer Mkhonto Radebe said: “We indicated before that we stand for justice. I detest this barbaric act by one of our own and call for consistency in our support for the victim. Gender-based violence perpetrators must fall.” The DA’s Kingsol Tshabalala condemned the incident. “We condemn the barbaric action of the ANC man. “We call on the police to speedily investigate and resolve this case. “As the DA, we say gender-based violence perpetrators must be permanently removed from society.” Police spokesman Warrant Officer Simon Mofokatsane confirmed that a case of rape was opened and that the man was arrested.
