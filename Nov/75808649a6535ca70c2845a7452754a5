UTHONGATHI coach, Johnny Ferreira, hopes their two-week break from GladAfrica Championship action doesn’t disturb his side’s winning momentum. The KZN outfit started the season like a house on fire and are currently perched atop the Championship standings with 25 points from 10 matches. The Cane Cutters, as Uthongathi are affectionately known, are unbeaten in their last six league matches and look like a team on a mission. But having sat out this weekend’s round of fixtures, and with the international break coming up, their mentor Ferreira is worried that they might lose their momentum. “I’ve never been in favour of these long breaks,” admitted Ferreira. “I think players don’t really understand what they are for. They don’t know how to use these breaks. “They’re supposed to relax and recuperate so they can come back fresher, but that’s often not the case. “The other thing is that these breaks halt momentum, you don’t really want them when you’re on a roll like we are. We’d obviously prefer to keep playing and winning games consistently.” Nevertheless, Ferreira believes his side will return much stronger and pick up where they left off with players such as Menzi Ndwandwe and Njabulo Ngcobo playing key roles. They host TS Sporting at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday 23 November (3pm). They appear to be running away with the league but Ferreira insists they’re not getting ahead of themselves. “It’s still fairly early days, I’d say,” added Ferreira. “There’s still 20 more games to be played and 60 points to play for. “We can’t get afford to get carried away. A lot of teams are yet to show what they can really do.”JDR Stars and Ajax Cape Town are also breathing down our necks.” Ferreira has lauded his club’s management for allowing him to work his magic without much interference, something he believes has been key to their early success. “They let me do what I do best. I have the freedom to do things my way.”
