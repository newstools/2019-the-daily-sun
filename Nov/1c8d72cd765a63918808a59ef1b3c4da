RUGBY World Cup winning coach Rassie Erasmus could reconsider his decision should the SA Rugby Union (Saru) comes calling to him for a role in Springboks. He told SunSport that the door is not completely shut on the union. Erasmus, who took over the Springboks job in February last year to replace beleaguered Allister Coetzee, is headed back to his role as director of rugby. He’s proudly stepping down after leading the Springboks to their third Webb Ellis trophy after they convincingly swept England aside 12-32 in a final in Japan earlier this month. “I’ll always be close enough to the team,” said Erasmus with a smile. “We’ll find somebody. If we don’t find somebody, I’ll be close enough to the team, and in that respect we’ll be okay.” At the time of Erasmus stepping up last year, the Springboks were in shambles under Coetzee. There was fear that the Boks will be the laughing stock of the world in the Japan finals, but he came up tops. Now the challenge stands that his next successor will find it tough to maintain the spirit in camp. The Springboks next test match will be against Scotland next year, followed by the Rugby Championships against the British and Irish Lions. “The big challenge is to find consistency,” revealed Erasmus, who this year won 10, lost one, drew one in 12 test matches. “We can be consistent like New Zealand. “That is the reason why I had to step up to the head coach position to get our structures right. We should not be a flesh in the pan, and that is exactly what we need to avoid.”
