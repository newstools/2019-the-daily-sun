FORMER Golden Arrows and Bafana Bafana midfielder Thanduyise Khuboni is on the comeback trail. The Clermont born midfielder is currently training with KwaZulu-Natal based GladAfrica Championship side Uthongathi FC. According to SunSport sources, Khuboni has been training with the club for two weeks. The 33-year-old, who has also played for Mpumalanga Black Aces, was last on the books of Highlands Park in 2016-17 season. His departure at Siyabahlaba/Siyabangena came after the club were relegated. Khuboni was one of the club’s highest earners and that is the reason why they couldn’t keep him when they went down to the National First Division now renamed the GladAfrica Championship. However, The Cane Cutters, who are at the summit of the Championship, are not in a rush to sign him as he is not match fit. Khuboni was part of the Uthongathi team that played a friendly match against Real Kings yesterday. “I have just received a report that his fitness is still very low,” said Uthongathi CEO Jackson Majapelo yesterday. If Khuboni is signed, he will bring a wealth of experience to the team. He was part of an Arrows side that won the MTN8 trophy in 2009 along with now Uthongathi skipper Philani Shange. He was also part of Carlos Alberto Perreira’s Bafana squad that played in the 2010 Fifa World Cup on home soil. Uthongathi are a very ambitious club and keen to maintain their place at the top of the standings. They have former Orlando Pirates midfielder Issa Sarr and former Free State Stars goalkeeper Badra Ali Sangaré in their squad. Sangare was part of Ivory Coast’s squad during the recent Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt.
