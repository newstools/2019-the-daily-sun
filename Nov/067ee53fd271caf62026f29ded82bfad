GHANA goalkeeper Richard Ofori says they have what it takes to overcome Bafana Bafana to increase their chances of qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The countries will battle it out in the first round of qualifiers at Cape Coast Sports Stadium in Ghana next Thursday (7pm, SA time). Ofori made this statement after he displayed a Man of the Match performance to help Maritzburg United hold Orlando Pirates 0-0 in league game on Tuesday. Bafana are due to assemble for camp on Monday prior to their departure to Ghana. Said Ofori: “It’s good to play Bafana, they have quality players. It’s good to play against big countries and Bafana are among them. There is always a good vibe in the team, so we need to stay focused to ensure we make our country proud.” The lanky shot stopper says they have youngsters who are hungry for success. “We have a new team that consist of seven or eight new faces and everyone wants to show what they can do for the nation. We need the team to work hard to overcome Bafana and you can’t do it alone. I know we will deliver and we are all eyeing victory, that’s the most important thing.” However, Bafana legend and Ofori’s coach at Maritzburg, Eric Tinkler has warned Molefi Ntseki’s charges not to underestimate Ghana if they are to book their ticket to Cameroon. “Obviously, Ghana for me is one of the biggest footballing nations on the continent with a lot of quality and majority of players that a based in Europe. "I watched them in the Afcon in Egypt, but they were little bit unfortunate not to go through (to the last eight), but they have a lot of talent, natural goal scorers, lot of strength as big like him (Ofori) through midfield and upfront, so we can never underestimate them. We obviously have to perform at our best.”
