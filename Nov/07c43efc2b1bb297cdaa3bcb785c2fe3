IT MAY be less than three months since former Springboks winger Chester Williams died, but his family’s grief is still raw. Williams’ wife Maria broke down in tears as her late husband was being honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the SA Sport Awards at the Playhouse in Durban, KZN, over the weekend. The Black Pearl, as Chester was affectionately known, was part of the historic 1995 Rugby World Cup-winning team. Maria said: “I’d like to thank everybody, mostly Sport Minister Nathi Mthethwa for all his support and his love towards our family. “But also, I’d like to thank everybody in South Africa who has been supporting us, and around the world. “I just want to say we’re missing our beloved Chester. “As you can see, it’s very difficult because we miss him a lot.” The 49-year-old died from a heart attack on 6 September. Chester was the fifth member of the Springbok squad from 1995 to die, after coach Kitch Christie, Ruben Kruger, Joost van der Westhuizen and James Small, who also died this year. Maria, the mother of three kids, said Chester would have been proud to see Siya Kolisi becoming the first black player to lift the World Cup as captain. The country is still celebrating the Boks’ World Cup title, South Africa’s third title, won in Japan. “We love Siya. And Chester must have been so proud of Siya,” she said as tears rolled down her cheeks. “I’m sure Chester was watching in heaven, seeing him lift that trophy.”
