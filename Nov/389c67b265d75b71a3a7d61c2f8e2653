Although winter might be a bit far off, you can get yourself some warming items in advance. We know that without any doubt, our butts do get cold when the weather drops but you don't have to worry more, Amazon's got you. The Smart Heated Panties are rechargeable and battery powered, with a 12-hour life span on the 'winter warmer' setting. The high-waisted panties are also a good alternative to a hot water bottle on your time of the month, although we're unsure about the scientific claims QQA make. The pants claim to protect health and fertility, regulate the uterus and help with anti-inflammatory repair.They have five settings, but some gears are too hot for extended use - so stick to four hours max for gear two, one hour for gear three, and five minutes for gear four.
