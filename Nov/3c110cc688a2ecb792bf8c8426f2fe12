SAFA Acting CEO Russell Paul is joining the 2022 Fifa World Cup organising team as the chief operations officer. This has been announced by Safa president Danny Jordaan as a press conference on Tuesday. Paul has been acting as the FA's chief executive for over a year now, having assumed the position relinquished by Dennis Mumble. "We are not surprised that he's been approached for the 2022 finals in Qatar, " said Jordaan. "Russell has vast experience. He has worked at the Fifa events, going back to the U17 World Cup 2009, 2011 in Mexico, 2013 in the UAE, the 2008 Club World Cup in Japan, the 2010 World Cup here at home, the 2014 in Brazil and the 2018 in Russia as well the Caf event, including the Champions League."  Safa vice-president Gay Mokoena, who is also head of the finance committee, will be taking over as acting CEO for the next three months while the search for the new CEO continues." "Mokoena is a man of substance, havingÂ worked in administration. He has served in many boards, " added Jordaan. Paul said it was a bittersweet moment for him to be leaving as there were some of the deals he would have loved to conclude. "But we are turning the corner with the financial challenges. We've closed a few deals and you'll be hearing more soon. Good things will be coming out of Safa in the next 12 months."
