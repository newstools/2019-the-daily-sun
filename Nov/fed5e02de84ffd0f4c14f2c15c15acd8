LIFE has been hell for this North West woman with six kids, five grandkids and three chickens. Kolobetso Sapa (42) of Setlagole Village lives in a mudhouse she built herself years ago and used plastic bags to roof it. READ: THE TERROR OF A CAT TAXI DRIVER! She doesn’t have electricity or water, and all her children didn’t go to school. Only two of her grandchildren managed to go to school. She said life hasn’t been easy. She sold Simba chips to locals to make ends meet. But yesterday she was over the moon when North West Premier Job Mokgoro, Social Development MEC Boitumelo Moiloa and Agriculture MEC Desbo Mohono brought her an extra 10 chickens to feed her family.  “I like the fact that there’s a rooster in my flock. That means they’ll be able to make chicks and we’ll be able to eat meat more often,” she said. While visiting the family, Moiloa told Kolobetso: “Don’t be sad. Government is here and we brought you a lot of things.” Peach trees were also planted.  Kolobetso said: “I’m grateful for everything.” She, however, felt it would be more of a blessing if she could have had a house instead. “I appreciate the food and the chickens, but a house would have been more meaningful because it was going to be a permanent structure, unlike food,” she said. Mokgoro and the MECs have launched the 16 Days campaign in Setlagole. In observing the campaign, they visited five households including Kolobetso’s home.
