GOLDEN Arrows will have to be prepared when they host Mamelodi Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout semi-final this coming weekend. This is threat from Masandawana coach Pitso Mosimane, who will be looking for a better outcome when these two sides meet in anticipated footbal sequel. This is after Arrows got the better of the Tshwane giants when they beat Sundowns 3-2 in the rain soaked Absa Premiership match at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium last week. But the nine-time league champions were without two key players – Gaston Sirino and Themba Zwane – due to injuries. Aware of the programme they have with the Caf Champions League group stages starting later this month, Mosimane also rested skipper Hlompho Kekana, Lebohang Maboe and Tiyani Mabunda so that he can have a fresh team against the hard and running Abafana Bes’Thende. “The Fifa break gave us some time to have Zwane back. And this will also give us time to have Sirino back, hopefully,” said Mosimane. “I can assure you come this weekend we’ll be in full force. So we accepted the loss. When you play and you are not winning, it means you are not good enough. So we’ll try some more.” Though Mosimane vowed that they will be in full force, he is still not taking Arrows for granted. Sundowns don’t have it easier against Arrows in Durban, he admitted. For Sundowns to beat Arrows in Durban this weekend, it will be first side to do so this season as Abafana Bes’Thende have not lost at their back yard, so far. “Arrows always give us hard time. We have been in Durban for the last four years and we win with one zeros,” revealed Mosimane. “So I was not surprised at how they played. We didn’t undermined them, we had to freshen up the team.”
