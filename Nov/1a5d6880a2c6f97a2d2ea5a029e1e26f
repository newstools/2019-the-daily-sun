A woman claims that sunbathing helps give her
punani energy and makes her sleep better. However,
doctors have warned others not to copy it. Social media
users were left lost for words after the woman's post about the little-known
practice of 'perineum sunning' went viral. The woman
called Meagan took to Instagram to share a very X-rated photo of herself laying
flat on her back in the great outdoors, holding her legs in the air with her
arms to get some rays on her punani.  According
to The Mirror, the woman explained that she begins every day with five minutes
of exposing her punani to the sun, and claims it leaves her so energised she's
been able to ditch the coffee. She also
said it has drastically improved her sleep but told others it should not be
done to 'tan your b***hole' as that is not the intention of the practice. Meagan, who
describes herself as a 'healer', also claimed that 30 seconds of the ritual is
'the equivalent of a full day of sunlight with your clothes on' and should be
done between the hours of 7-9am for best results. Doctors say
there is no evidence that sunbathing in this way has any effect on physical
wellbeing.
