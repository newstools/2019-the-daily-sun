LOBBY group AfriForum has laid criminal charges against Free State health department head, Dr David Motau. This is part of the group’s campaign against the National Health Insurance Bill. READ: THE TERROR OF A CAT TAXI DRIVER! After studying the department’s annual report, the group found there was evidence Motau had gone against the Public Finance Management Act. The charges are that over R446 million was wasted by the department. The group’s Joseph Renaud said: “This misappropriation of funds is one of the main reasons we cannot rely on the government to implement the National Health Insurance. They have shown they cannot be trusted with taxpayers’ money,” he said. “The annual report indicates the department incurred irregular expenditure of almost R324 million in the 2017/2018 financial year.” Renaud said it incurred fruitless and wasteful expenditure of almost R1 million in the 2017/2018 financial year and unauthorised expenditure of almost R140 million in the same year. At the time of going to print, health spokesman Mondli Mvambi had not responded to the SunTeam’s inquiries. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed a case was opened. “The complaint is that of irregular expenditure, unauthorised expenditure and fruitless and wasteful expenditure,” he said.
