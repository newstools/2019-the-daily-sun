THE ways of banking are changing and very fast. The latest launch of Money App Lite, a more streamlined and lighter version of the Nedbank Money App, is one example how banking is taking another turn. Money App Lite balances providing rich digital banking experiences with the need to ensure access for all clients, including those with limited data or memory. According to Stelios Vakis, digital executive for Nedbank Retail and Business Banking, it’s important to realise that, while the bank has clearly stated its Digitally First, First in Digital ambitions, it is also a bank for all. The recently launched Affordability Report indicates that the average cost of 1GB of data is 7,12% of the average monthly salary. “Combine this with the fact that South Africa’s data prices are among the highest on the continent, and we certainly have a significant challenge around accessibility on our hands,” said Vakis. App benefits includes: Additionally, the app can also be downloaded directly from the bank’s website by people who don’t have access to Google Play Store. “We’re committed to ensuring that our customers are integral to our digital journey,” said Vakis. “And that has led us to consistently deliver market leading client-empowering digital offerings, of which Money App Lite is the latest example.”
