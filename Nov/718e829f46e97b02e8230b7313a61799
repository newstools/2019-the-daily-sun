GOLDEN ARROWS coach Steve Komphela says his failure to win a trophy in his coaching career doesn’t bother him. His chance to win his first trophy went up in smoke on Saturday when Abafana Bes’thende lost 2-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout semi-final at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium. Komphela, who has managed to reach three cup finals in his coaching career will now have to wait a bit longer before he realises his goal. The former Amakhosi coach will take solace from the fact that his side are fourth on the Absa Premiership table, where he want his players to focus on. “We have to change our focus and quickly forget this. We can’t change this,” said Komphela. “Those who got knocked out when there were 16 teams, have healed. Those who got knocked out when they were eight teams, are not completely healed. “Those who are getting knocked out in the semis are feeling a fresh pain. Somebody is going to feel the pain and worse when you lose in the cup final. From our side, we still got a mission to compete. We now concentrate on the Absa Premiership.” Komphela admitted though that Sundowns had an edge as they are “too experienced” for such occasion compared to his side, despite the visitors finishing the game with 10 men after Gaston Sirino was sent off. Cleverly, coach Pitso Mosimane tweaked his line up just before the second half got underway. He took off captain Hlompho Kekana, who powered home the first goal, and replaced him with Tiyani Mabunda. This substitute came after the Bafana international was cautioned just three minutes after the game got underway. Mosimane feared that Kekana, may get another yellow card. “Sundowns are more experienced for sure,” revealed Komphela. “But our team performed well in the second half. But we didn’t pitch in the first half. Had we played the same way like we did in the second half there won’t be an issue of experience.”
