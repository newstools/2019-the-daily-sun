Bafana Bafana and Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune seems to have scored a big goal in his personal life. Yesterday the SunTeam reported that  Khune paid ilobolo for his girlfriend Sphelele Makhunga. READ: PICS: KHUNE'S MAKOTI! It seems now that the couple may be expecting a baby! According to a screengrab from Khune's Instagram, he posted a photo of himself touching his new bride's belly. The photo is no longer on his IG but is doing the rounds on social media.More photos of Sphelele in traditional SeTswana attire have surfaced with many people congratulating her.  One photo from her IG is captioned, "the aunts came bearing gifts for the makoti",which hints to Khune's aunts who travelled to KZN and dressed their new makoti. Earlier today Khune posted a photo of himself by a beach, showing that he is likely still in KZN. Ricky Rick's 'Zulu Girls'song is true to Khune who has previously dated Zulu girls Minnie Dlamini,who is now Mrs Jones, and Sbahle Mpisane. The emergence of Sphelele  earlier this year raised eyebrows as Sbahle was still dating Khune when she was involved in a serious car accident last year August. Khune had continously posted photo of a recovering Sbahle until Sphelele appeared. In June, Sphelele explained that her and Itu once dated for a year, and then rekindled their relationship in 2019.
