THREE women from Mtubatuba, northern KZN are lucky to be alive. This comes after they were rescued at Umfolozi River yesterday (Thursday). It is alleged that the three women stayed in the homes close to this river and it happened that it burst its banks.  KZN MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka said his department has since dispatched disaster management teams in Mtubatuba where the river burst its banks threatening residents in the surrounding homes. He said yesterday afternoon rescuers responded to an incident where three women who were farming were cut off by rising waters of the the river. "The speedy response by rescue teams ensured that the women were brought to safety by boat," said Hlomuka. He said they urge residents living along the banks of the uMfolozi river to find alternative shelter on more safer places as water levels are expected to increase further. “We are in contact with our teams on the ground and we urge residents living next to the river to seek shelter on higher ground. Our teams are on high alert in this area and will intervene timeously should the need arise,” said Hlomuka. The province has been faced with heavy rains since last Friday.
