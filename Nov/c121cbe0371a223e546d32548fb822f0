THE crowd demanded he uncover his face, while some hurled insults at him. “Stop hiding. Why are you covering your face, murderer!” shouted someone in the gallery. This was the scene when Luyanda Botha appeared in the Wynberg Magistrates Court in Cape Town yesterday. He walked in with his face covered. He appeared in connection with the murder of University of Cape Town student, Uyinene Mrwetyana. Botha told the court he wouldn’t apply for bail, which angered many people in the courtroom. “He must be granted bail because we want him to come out and get some proper justice from the public,” said Mlungisi Jalana (31), one of the activists in court. Botha appeared on two charges of rape, one for murder and one for defeating the ends of justice. Advocate Rodney de Kock, who’s leading the prosecution, said further investigations led to the fourth charge of rape, but he couldn’t explain further. Magistrate Goolam Bawa lifted the ban to identify Botha, which was placed by the court during his previous appearance. Botha will appear in court tomorrow, where his case is expected to move to the Western Cape High Court. Uyinene went missing on 24 August after she had gone to fetch a parcel at the post office in Claremont. Her body was later found in Lingelethu West in Khayelitsha and her death caused a huge outcry across the country. University of Cape Town student Naome Martins said they were happy the law was taking its course. “They must throw him in jail and lock him up forever. I wish the trial starts and finishes quickly. He must suffer for what he did,” said Naome.
