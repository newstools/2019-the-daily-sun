SUPPORTERS  came out in their numbers to cheer, sing and dance as the Springboks paraded the Webb Ellis Cup which started in Pretoria on Thursday morning and was concluded in Soweto at Orlando Stadium with Orlando Pirates players.  South Africans lined the streets of Gauteng on Thursday to witness the Boks' trophy parade, they did so with their best foot forward with quirky impersonations, chants of Shosholoza and circles of dancing fans.  The final stop was Orlando Stadium where they spend some time with Bucs players. Hopefully the Bucanners drawn some inspiration from the World Champions as they have been struggling thus far in the Absa Premiership.  On Friday they will paint the streets of Durban Gold and Green as the trophy parade continues.
