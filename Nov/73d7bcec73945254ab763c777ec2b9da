INKATHA Freedom Party in KZN has called on the task team investigating political killings in the province to conduct a lifestyle audit on all suspects to check how they are affording expensive lawyers. This was told Daily Sun by the party's provincial secretary Xolani Dube on Tuesday. Dube was speaking outside Escourt magistrate court where he led scores of party supporters who came to oppose bail for the 26-year-old man who is accused of killing the party councillor in Inkosi Langalibalele municipality Mthembeni Majola. The accused Ayanda Mvelase also from Weenen outside Escourt where Majola lived dumped state's legal aid lawyer and brought his own on Tuesday. He was supposed to apply for the bail but changed his mind and abandoned it. His lawyer Shafique Sarlie from Shafique Inc.said his client felt it didn't make sense to apply for bail as he has two pending cases to still apply for bail for in Joburg. Dube said it is clear that the accused is a hired hitman which means he has his bosses somewhere who are paying for his lawyer." We thought today the suspect will reveal who had hired him or tell us why he killed Majola. This boy is young surely he has never had a problem with Majola so we believe he was hired," said Dube. He said the party hasÂ  noticed that suspects in the political killings always bring top law firms to court and police must investigate the income of the suspects because there is no point sentencing hit man while the real killer is free. He said the real killers are those rich people who take an advantage of unemployed youth and use as hitmen. Majola was shot and killed in Escourt in August. His bodyguard Sithembiso Mahlinza who was driving died later at the hospital.Majola's nephew Fah Bhaila survived the shooting.
