WE ARE fast approaching Christmas, and when the spirit takes over, most people forget about saving. Yes, we may be stuck in a debt trap and unable to change our behaviour, but it doesn’t have to happen to our children. Money Savvy Kids is a guide that aims to put an end to financial illiteracy cycle, starting with our kids. Money Savvy Kids is revolutionising the way financial knowledge is shared to younger generations while questioning the traditional schooling system, which currently produces more followers than leaders. “It infuses children, from a very young age, with the problem-solving and critical thinking skills they need to make financial decisions now and, in the future, using the analytical skills they learn through the program,” said Kathryn Main, the CEO of Money Savvy Kids. The guide is also designed to help people through the hardest time of the year by saving and budgeting your way to a worry-free January. “Christmas past is key. Learning from previous Christmas spending blunders is a good place to start when it comes to creating a new and improved Christmas budget. Here are Main’s tips to help you: - Cash in your loyalty points. That Dischem card you have been swiping all year will become the second most important card in your wallet or purse this Christmas. Make sure to ask in-store and browse online for all the rewards they have, before handing over cold-hard cash when buying presents for loved ones. - Use a debit card as opposed to a credit card. This is important to making sure there are no outstanding balances that need to be paid once January rolls around. - Christmas spending list. Don’t be tempted to spend your whole bonus on a holiday. Save about 30% of your bonus and allocate 25% to paying off debt.
