THE Khumalo sisters have spoken out about the Senzo Meyiwa murder – but Mzansi people are not hearing any of it. On e.tv’sMorning Show Kelly said: “People have already decided I’m guilty. Why must I defend myself?” Kelly’s sister, Zandi, wrote on Instagram that she felt for the Meyiwa family. “But the way they treated my family since the incident, I owe them nothing,” she wrote. She called on the family to move on. “Their anger and abuse is misdirected. Their sense of overentitlement towards my family needs to stop,” Zandi wrote. People bashed the sisters on the Daily Sun Facebook page. Phumzile said: “Senzo’s spirit is haunting them one by one.” Godfrey said: “Really, little sister? You were there when he was killed or murdered. You owe evidence to the family and the public. Sorry.” Mzoxolo said: “The days are numbered for the killers of Senzo Meyiwa.” Kenneth said: “Senzo’s family never said you owe them. They just want justice for their son. Senzo’s killer and his protectors, their day is coming.” The comments from the sisters came after a Sunday paper reported that Senzo was shot by one of the people who were in the house at the time. Daily Sun’s efforts to get comment from family spokesman Sfiso Meyiwa were fruitless.
