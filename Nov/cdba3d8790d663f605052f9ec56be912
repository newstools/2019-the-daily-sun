There's so much in common and similarities between these four former Kaizer Chiefs stars... They were blessed with the most amazing dribbling skills and they were destined for greater heights. But sadly the four did not live up to expectations and their careers did not reach the highs that would have matched their God-given talents. While Jabu "Shuffle" Mahlangu has managed to turn his life around, the other three have not been so lucky. Mahlangu is an Analyst and ambassador for Supersport and does a lot of motivational talks for the youth in Mzansi. The other three are trying to pick up the pieces after squandering it all and throwing their careers in the drain. What's your fondest memory of the four players?
