SunSports reporter Mthokozisi Mkhonza recently had a nice time when he was invited to ShaYe Lounge… The swanky pub/lounge, situated in Dobsonville, Soweto, is jointly owned by former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana stars Siphiwe “Shabba” Tshabalala and Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane. ShaYe which is a combination of their nicknames, was opened early this year. Both are in the twilight of their careers. Letsholonyane, is still kicking the ball for Highlands Park while Shabba is still looking for a club.  With Football not being a lifetime career, many players battle with financial and emotional problems once they have stopped playing, that is not a secret.In most cases that is caused by not having anything to fall back to when they hang their boots, or some when they sustained lifetime injuries.  The place attracts young, funky, clean and upwardly mobile patrons who are looking for quality good time.  The place serves a variety of popular drinks and the most delicious shisa-nyama. Letsholonyane told SunSport that they decided two years ago to open the place as part of investing. “We did this just to prepare for life after football - not only looking at us, but also to give back to the community by creating job opportunities for the locals.”  “Yeye” revealed that their plan is to open more branches.He stated: “Currently we have 11 people working there. Long term goal, we are looking at opening other branches in other places.”
