SIPHIWE "Shabba" Tshabalala is set to return to Europe in January where he will join an undisclosed club. Shabba is currently in South Africa keeping fit for the January transfer window period where he has a choice of two clubs to choose from. The 35-year-old businessman has not played professionally ever since he left Turkish club, BB Erzurumspor, at the end of the past season. He was reported in August to be training with a Mpumalanga ABC Motsepe side, Passion FC, a club he said he would not just join. "... I'm in Mpumalanga because the owner of the team Passion Football Club, is a very close friend of mine. I'm just here to motivate the boys and hopefully inspire them...," he was quoted at the time." His manager Jazzman Mahlakgane was non-commital on Wednesday when confronted about Shabba's next move. "Let us talk about it when the time is right," was all he could say about the former Kaizer Chiefs left-footed star. Chiefs supporters have been calling on club bosses - Kaizer and Bobby Motaung - to consider signing Shabba, as they believe he would help them win some silverware. But the midfielder from Soweto is still dreaming of returning to Europe.
