 SINGER Lady Zamar left Mzansi confused. This after she posted gorgeous wedding photos on her Instagram and Twitter with sweet captions. One of the captions reads: “A love so true.” It left many people asking themselves, has she truly walked down the isle, or was it just a music video shoot? Social media users quickly joined in the discussion. Some labelled her as "If suka amabhozen was a person" and some are happy that she's moved on. But the discussion went on for hours without her answering questions. Others compared this with Dumi Mkokstad’s wedding drama when he allegedly told one of his girlfriends he was doing a music video while getting married. Another caption read: “Life has a way of weeding out bad things and bad people... I’ve learnt to trust in the one who made/makes life.” I’ve been blessed and highly favored????♥? #Grateful — MONARCH???? (@Lady_Zamar) November 15, 2019 A love so pure and so true??????
