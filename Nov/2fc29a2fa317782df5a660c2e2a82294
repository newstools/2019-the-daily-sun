A MASS funeral was held for five pupils who died in a horrific car crash last Tuesday. Lucky Monareng (19), Chantel Monareng (15), Pearl Rakgalakane (17), Karabo Mogoaneng (16) and Beauty Motshweni (17) from AM Mashego Secondary School in Limpopo had just finished writing an exam paper when they hitch-hiked a white NP200 Nissan bakkie. But the driver lost control and the bakkie rolled. The pupils died on the spot. The funeral yesterday at Kgaphamadi Village, outside Jane Furse, was attended by residents, pupils, teachers and MECs Polly Boshielo (education, Dickson Masemola (transport and community safety) and Monica Mochadi (public works, roads and infrastructure). Boshielo said: “On Saturday, we buried two pupils in Vuwani and two more in the Sekhukhune area. And we’re again burying five today. It’s a very sad weekend for the Department of Education.” Meanwhile, the 29-year-old driver of the bakkie is still recovering in hospital under police guard. He’ll appear in the Nebo Magistrates Court on 27 November for a formal bail application. The driver faces five counts of culpable homicide and drunk driving.
