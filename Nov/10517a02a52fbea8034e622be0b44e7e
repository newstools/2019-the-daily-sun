THEY were happy when cops finally responded to their plea for a mobile police station to be placed near their clinic. But their happiness was short-lived when all of a sudden the station was removed. Now residents want the cops to bring back their mobile police station! The station was placed next to the KTC Gugulethu Community Health Centre in Gugulethu, Cape Town, because patients and staff members were being robbed and stabbed. Nwabisa Mzana (37) said the station was placed there last year but was soon removed. “Police deputy minister at the time, Bongani Mkongi, said the mobile station would be here forever. Criminals are not stupid. When the station was there, they stopped robbing patients and staff but when it was removed, people got robbed again,” she said. Another resident said they saw the mobile station in Gugulethu Mall. A staff member at the clinic said when the station was there, they worked freely. “These criminals don’t only rob people coming to work or going home, they come into the parking lot and rob people there,” he said Sergeant Siyabulela Malo said the mobile station was being moved around Gugulethu based on crime pattern analysis.
