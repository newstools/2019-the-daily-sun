NO matter what your financial challenges are, keep saving money. This is FNB Retail money management CEO Doret Jooste’s advice. She said many people are unable to save money regularly because the cost of living is too high. She said unchanged interest rates and the rising petrol price, as well as food and electricity costs, are some of the factors which continue to put financial pressure on peoples’ income. Doret said despite all these, people can still save by changing how they manage their money. According to the bank’s money management unit, which looks at the savings potential of its customers, people are still heavily reliant on loans to get through each month. “However, looking at our middle-income clients, we found that by making a few small changes in financial or spending behaviours, they can actually free up a significant amount of cash every month,” said Doret. She shared some simple ways to save money: Unlike most rewards programmes, eBucks has no membership fee and you earn rewards simply by using your bank account.
