WHAT a poor way to start a qualifier campaign! Bafana Bafana went down 2-0 to Ghana in their opening 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday. Goals from Thomas Partey and Mohammed Kudus in either half ensured the Black Stars shine bright... even on a dark night. It was always going to be a massive task for Molefi Ntseki's men to win in West Africa, given their poor preparation for the match. But past results away from home, including the famous win in Nigeria two years ago, had given South Africans belief and hope of a positive outcome. Partey thundered in past a flat-footed Williams to send the crowd into a frenzy. It was due reward for the effort the home side put in, having dominated the opening half. The Athletico Madrid midfielder was one of the few senior players in a team teeming with fresh faces, and his experienced told with how directed play for the Black Stars. But Bafana were still in the game, and despite the injury-enforced withdrawal of Bongani Zungu they still held their own in the midfield. Ntseki rung five changes to the team that beat Mali 2-1 in the Nelson Mandela Challenge friendly, with the return of defensive trio, Buhle Mkhwanazi, Thamsanqa Mkhize and S'fiso Hlanti. In fact, Bafana could have found an early breakthrough, had Bradley Grobler had a better shot when fed by Percy Tau 16 minutes into the match. Substitute Thapelo Morena's effort was thwarted by Maritzburg United 'keeper Richard Ofori. But Mohamed Kudus made no mistake as he turned both centre-backs, Thulani Hlatshwayo and Mkhwanazi, inside out before striking in Ghana's second on the 79th minute. Of course, the journey to Cameroon 2021 is still long, but certainly wasn't the right step to take for Bafana. They will look to bounce back when they host Sudan in the second qualifier at Orlando Stadium on Sunday.
