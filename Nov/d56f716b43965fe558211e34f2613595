Following a motorbiking accident, Maluks the bird was there for him. “I needed someone to talk to and Maluks was there for me,” said Maluks the human. Yes… it’s confusing right? So, let me explain. Maluks the Parrot was there in times of need for Maluks the human, who had been in a motorbiking accident. In this case, Maluks the human is the owner of the parrot who is also named Maluks. So, now that’s out the way – following the accident Maluks’ leg was amputated. Since the beginning of time, the lives of parrots and people have been closely interlinked for centuries and the story of these two is a true meaning of the relationship. “I got the parrot following my accident, because I needed to talk to someone and there was no one there for me,” Maluks said. According to him following the accident his house was always full of people, but they were allegedly not there to support him. He says they were there for the food in his fridge. “As soon as I locked the fridge, they disappeared into thin air,” he added. He says at first, he didn’t know if the parrot could speak or not. “It was so embarrassing carrying around a parrot and you don’t even know if it can speak or not” “The first words that came out of his mouth were – Hallelujah, imagine! Out of all the things he could have said, he chose hallelujah,” Maluks said. He says he couldn’t understand the connection and it puzzled him. “In the end I understood, because I was from church on that day.”
