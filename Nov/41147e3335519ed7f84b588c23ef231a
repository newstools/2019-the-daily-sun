Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp says football is a physical game and that there's nothing wrong with an aggressive style of play. The German tactician spoke in response to his Orlando Pirates counterpart Rhulani Mokwena who claimed that Chiefs employed "thuggish" tactics in the Soweto derby, which Amakhosi won 3-2. Middendorp pulled no punches, stating that he isn't in the business of coaching to make friends and to take it easy against his opposition. "If you're in a game, sorry, there's nothing to talk about you having to kiss each other or go lightly (on the opponent)," said Middendorp. "You do the preparations two or three days before then the 90 minutes get heated based on whatever you do intentionally or to provoke - that's something that happened. "Some coaches are taking it, and sometimes you need an hour longer or a day more to eat it and process it, but I have already a friend; I don't need another one." Chiefs are currently running away with the Absa Premiership as they enjoy a 10-point lead over second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
