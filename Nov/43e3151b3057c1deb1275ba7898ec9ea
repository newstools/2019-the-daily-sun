DEPUTY President David Mabuza has urged civil society and the private sector to work with government to stop the increase in HIV infections. Speaking at the South African National Aids Council plenary meeting in Secunda in Mpumalanga on Saturday, Mabuza said it was the responsibility of the three partners to empower women and young girls with information that could save their lives. “One HIV infection is one too many,” said Mabuza. “Working with our partners in society and in business, it is possible to reverse the pandemic that has affected about 7,4 million people who are HIV positive. “We need to continue putting in place practical and decisive measures to reduce incidence levels as we know how much it affects young women,” he said. “It is within our grasp to reverse the pandemic and conquer gender-based violence. We’ll win the battle by working with all stakeholders in our schools, our homes, boardrooms and workplaces.” Mabuza said government would work closely with district mayors to strengthen district Aids councils. “The model of district participation will ensure we make the desired impact. We’ve given ourselves the responsibility of reaching two million people who need to be tested and treated,” he said.
