THE colours of cellular giants MTN are yellow. But on Thursday the famous cellular logo had a tinge of green and gold, as the Springboks, the newly-crowned Rugby World Cup champions, stopped over at the sponsor company's headquarters in Joburg as part of their trophy tour.  Throngs of fans, staff members jostled for spaces in an attempt to get a better glimpse of Siya Kolisi and his team, standing atop a makeshift stage. Wild celebrations have been the order of the day since the team arrived home from Japan where they clinched the country's third World Cup title on Tuesday.  Fans filled the streets of Pretoria for parade ticker-tape parade with hundreds coming out to hail the champions as the Boks open-top bus passed through. The bus, carrying Rassie Erasmus and his men, made its first stop at the Union Buildings, then inched its way through the capital city town before it proceeded to the MTN headquarters.  Several other stops on Thursday include Soweto, downtown Joburg and Braamfontein will wrap up the Gauteng leg, before the team fly out to Durban on Friday.
