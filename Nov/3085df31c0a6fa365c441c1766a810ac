Following recent reports around the investigations into the death of late Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa, Kelly Khumalo appeared in a TV interview to air her side of story. She said people already found her guilty but only her and God know the truth. Now her younger sister Zandi, also broke her silence in long post on Instagram. Zandi wrote on her Instagram page that the Meyiwa family should "get closure and move on". She wrote: “What I want Senzo's family and the society to know is that after the truth that I have told the police and the sympathy that I feel for them as they lost a hero, a son, a brother and a father... after the hurt that I still feel for his passing plus the way that they treated my family since the incident…. I owe them nothing, they must never feel entitled to anything else in my life.” She said she understands and feel the pain they are going through but that does not give them the right to abuse them. “Their anger and abuse is misdirected and this sense of over entitlement they have developed towards my family needs to stop,” she wrote. All these comments come following reports from a Sunday papers that Senzo was shot by one of the seven people who were in the house at the time of the incident. The Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper was killed during a robbery five years ago at the house of Kelly Khumalo’s mother in Vosloorus. Since then, no one has been arrested for the murder. Cops have been investigating ever since.
