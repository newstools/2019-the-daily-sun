HIGHLANDS Park boss Brad Kaftel has given coach Owen Da Gama five years to win the Absa Premiership title. Despite Kaftel fully knowing that they won’t have an easy passage to realise their target, he is confident they will eventually realise their dream. “It’s all a process of development and getting players to improve in order to win the league. We are not a selling team, we haven’t sold our players. “We have seen Mothobi Mvala now being called up to the national team and Luckyboy Mokoena was called up the previous time. “We’ve got (Peter) Shalulile from Namibia and (Limbikani) Mzava the Malawian international doing a good job. “We have now signed Abdi Banda, the Tanzanian international. We’ve got quiet a good pedigree, so we are trying step by step to get better, month by month, game by game, year by year. As long as we are better than last season, we’ll eventually win the title in a long run.” However, Da Gama assured Kaftel that he can deliver the title within the next three years. Explained Da Gama: “I always believe in building strong foundations. I personally think too much has happened too soon for Highlands Park which also raises expectations. People think the club will be winning every game and that is false. We are a team that is growing slowly and I believe maybe in three years time we can turn around and say we want to challenge for the league. “But for now we’ve got to be realistic and we don’t want to undermine teams that have been in the league for six or more years.
