GOGO Ellen Magagula believes she and her family were saved by God’s grace when part of their home came crumbing down in the rain. The 62-year-old gogo’s house was wreaked by a hailstorm that hit Makoko, outside White River in Mpumalanga, last week. Gogo Ellen said as the storm lashed her house, she was ready to meet her Maker but “He said no”. “I took my kids and ran into the house and locked the doors when the rain started. Everything happened so fast and all I could hear was God’s voice. “He kept asking if I had prayed. I looked for the person who was saying that but I couldn’t see anyone. I got confused but the voice kept saying: ‘Don’t cover yourselves, pray and move out of the house’,” she said. Besides cheating death, gogo Ellen said her heart was sore because she had just finished building the house. Now she has nowhere to live. “I don’t know what to do now. Everything has been destroyed by the rain. I hope the government will assist us in getting our lives back,” she said. At least 100 homes were damaged by the storm. Two schools and a clinic in the area were also not spared. Mbombela Mayor Sibusiso Mathonsi said the municipality would send out a team to assess the damage and come up with an appropriate relief mechanism.
