FITNESS bunny Sbahle Mpisane knows the person who caused her accident last year. “I know who caused my accident and I’m not mad at them.” Sbahle couldn’t remember anything from her past after the crash last August. She said her memory started coming back in April. “I went out with friends,” she told Daily Sun. “I shared a video singing along. I remember some things. I remember my varsity and the classes I used to go to perfectly.” On Monday Sbahle shared she remembered who caused her accident on Instagram. She said the cameras weren’t working on the day of the crash. “People said I was drunk and that’s why I had the accident,” she said. “In my flashbacks I saw the guy who caused the accident. I never shared anything about my recurring dream.” Sbahle posted on Instagram so the person responsible can see she knows what happened. “We will meet one day and we’ll talk. I will share more so people can see that I’m not crazy,” said Sbahle. She said she’d meet Brian Ndlovu, the guy who took her out of the car before it burned out. “I want to thank him for saving my life,” said Sbahle. She told Daily Sun her mum Shauwn put her in a brain treatment programme. She spends an hour a day in a machine. “I share everything on my social media as part of my therapy, including that I know who caused my accident and that I’m not mad,” she said. Sbahle said going to gym is part of her recovery but she is taking it easy.
