IT WAS A rare sight – Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane cosying up to Thuli Madonsela in a photo that emerged over the weekend. The two were photographed during what seemed to be a pleasant chat at the Pan-African Bar Association’s anniversary dinner in Joburg on Friday night. Madonsela couldn’t be reached yesterday but Mkhwebane told Daily Sun it was a warm encounter. “She was warm towards me and I was warm towards her. We met in an environment where speakers emphasised the need for black professionals to work together,” she said. Mkhwebane said they discussed the Venda Pension Fund issue, which they both agreed the government needed to solve by paying up. Madonsela wrote a report finding beneficiaries of the fund were not properly consulted when it was privatised, leading to some reportedly getting the standard government pension instead of a higher amount. Mkhwebane later wrote a report ordering the National Treasury to comply with Madonsela’s remedial action. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni indicated he would take both reports on review.
