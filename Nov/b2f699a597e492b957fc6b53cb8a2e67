THE challenges that national Under-23 coach David Notoane had to deal with is something his predecessor Owen da Gama can relate to. Notoane struggled to get a full team that will do duty for South Africa in the Caf Youth Championship in few days’ time in Egypt. The 50-year-old and Safa were scrambling to come up with a solid 21-man team for the tournament, with SuperSport United unwilling to release Teboho Mokoena and Sipho Mbule. “Unfortunately, that is the nature of the game,” said da Gama. The Highlands Park coach was in a similar position when he led Mzansi to the last tournament in 2015 which was held in Senegal. Two of his key players then, Orlando Pirates Menzi Masuku and Gift Motupa joined the camp late as Bucs were involved in the Caf Confederations Cup final. Da Gama’s side, though, eventually finished third after defeating hosts Senegal in the third and fourth play-off on penalties to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games that were held in Brazil. The tournament, being staged outside the Fifa calendar, has not only caused clubs to be unwilling to release players in SA, but countries such as Ghana and Senegal have also had to pull all the stops to convince clubs abroad. Despite these challenges, da Gama has faith in Notoane who left for Egypt yesterday with his charges. “I think he’s a brilliant coach. He mentioned that it is jungle there, so with that mentality he’ll get it right,” da Gama revealed. Notoane’s boys, who are in Group A with Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia, will hope to emulate da Gama’s feat of four years ago and help Young Bafana to finish as one of the three best nations to quality for the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year. They’ll start the competition against Young Chipolopolo on Saturday, before facing Young Elephants on 12 November. They’ll conclude the group stages against champions Nigeria on the 15 November. All these games will be played at Al Salam Stadium.
