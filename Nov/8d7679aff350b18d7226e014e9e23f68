PARENTS are not paying school fees and the principal is sending kids home. This is according to parents who came to Daily Sun to complain. But principal Sam Masuka of Nashville High School in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, told the People’s Paper the parents must stop treating his school like a park. “They drop their kids in Jaguars, BMWs and Range Rovers, but they claim they can’t afford school fees.”  He said pupils order food from Uber Eats and Debonairs. “Umalusi said parents who fall behind in their payments for two months must take their kids to government schools,” he said. Masuka said there are parents who have only paid twice since the beginning of the year. “Some are in arrears by R8 000. Soon the school will close then who will pay? Some kids have passed matric and their parents still owe fees. I pay teachers half salaries so we can carry on because we want to give the kids a bright future.” READ: PASTOR TURNS TO WINE! Daily Sun spoke to several parents who admitted they have financial problems. “Its not like I’m not going to pay. “I’ll pay as soon as I get the money,” said a parent. Another parent said: “I know I owe the school a lot of money.” A pupil said he’s worried he’ll go to a government school after his parents failed to pay. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said in case parents felt they won’t be able to pay, they should make arrangements with the school. “Parents must honour their commitments,” he said.
