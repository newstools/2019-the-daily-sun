SIDE chicks are every woman’s nightmare in a relationship. And according to most men, they are not going anywhere! The Daily Sun Team asked men how they felt about side chicks. France Sibuyi (38) has been married for seven years. He said his wife was struggling to conceive. He said: “I love my wife with all my heart. I’d love to have more children. I have a 13-year-old son with a woman I dated before I met my wife. I told her I wanted to get a second wife or a side chick just to give me more children but she refused. I don’t want to have an affair behind her back. That’s why I keep discussing this issue with her.” Lucky Chiloane (33) said: “I’m obsessed with side chicks. They make life fun because they are adventurous. But I will never leave my main chick for them.” Felix Tivana (47) said he was raised in polygamy. He said: “I have six children with my wife back home in Mozambique, and I stay here in Joburg with my girlfriend. I want to marry her one day.” This is what SunReaders on Facebook had to say.
