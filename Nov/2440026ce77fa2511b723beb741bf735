JOBURG residents will have to wait until next week to find out who their new mayor will be. Council speaker Vasco Da Gama yesterday postponed the sitting to decide who would replace Herman Mashaba to Wednesday. The candidates were the DA’s Funzela Ngobeni, EFF’s Musa Novela and ANC’s Geoffrey Makhubo. Da Gama postponed the sitting to seek legal opinion around majority rule but this made many unhappy. READ: STRONG BATTLE OVER JOZI! EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu said the correct interpretation of majority rule, according to his party, was that 51% of councillors had to vote for the mayor. ANC regional secretary Dada Morero said the party would approach the courts over the issue, saying the ANC believed the DA had made an illegal decision.

As presiding officer, it is incumbent upon you to consult the legal services of the council where possible to source an opinion. The DA is just postponing their pain and the reality is coming to them.” DA chairman Mike Moriarty said the decision was a correct and proper one. He said had voting continued the winner would have been dragged in and out of court to defend the legality of their election. He also said whatever deal the EFF and ANC had was falling apart.
