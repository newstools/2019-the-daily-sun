KAIZER Chiefs ace Khama Billiat has revealed that there are no hard feelings between himself and Orlando Pirates star Thembinkosi Lorch. This after Lorch appeared to stamp on Billiat in their Telkom Knockout clash last weekend – causing a scuffle between players from both sides. However, Billiat insists that there was no malice involved but perhaps just a sudden rush of blood to the head on Lorch’s behalf. “No I don’t think it was something personal,” said Billiat. “I think it was just a big game. We need to control our emotions in such games. They come with a lot of pressure. “It was just a moment where one could maybe control themselves better. But I don’t think it was anything personal.” The two talismanic attackers are set to resume their battle on Saturday (3.30pm) when the two Soweto giants meet again at the FNB Stadium.
