NINE people escaped death when a building suddenly collapsed yesterday in Durban. The three-story building collapsed into one of the shops in Pixley Kaseme Street and injured nine people who were inside. Eight people had to be rushed to hospital for medical attention as they suffered minor injuries. Shopper Noluthando Sibiya (24) said she was walking near the building when it collapsed. She had just gone past it when she heard a loud noise from behind. “I then heard people screaming. I went back to see and discovered that they were just injured. Paramedics took them out of the rubble. “I thought people were dead. I’m glad nobody died,” she said. She said she didn’t know why the building collapsed. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said members from Durban Search and Rescue along with the K9, Metro police, eThekwini Fire and Rescue, KZN Emergency Medical Rescue Services, Rescue Care and Life Response emergency services and IPSS Medical Rescue all responded to a building which collapsed. She said rescuers removed nine occupants from the building. “Eight of them were treated for minor injuries before being transported to hospital. “The K9 unit conducted a search in the collapsed structure for any further victims.” Mbele said city engineers and building inspectors were on the scene and confirmed the building was previously issued with contravention notices. “Fortunately, there was no loss of life or serious injuries,” said Mbele.
