PROPHET Sibongile Mtolo says King Shaka is turning in his grave, furious with people who poke next to a stone he rested on along the Amanzimtoti River. The 47-year-old prophet from Felekisi Village near Amanzimtoti told Daily Sun Shaka started visiting her in her dreams in 2013.  She said he told her the Zulu royal family didn’t know about the stone and he wanted King Goodwill Zwelithini to cleanse it. Sibongile said in her dream Shaka was carrying a spear and was very angry. “In the dream, he led me to the site and I later found it very easily,” she said. On Friday, Sibongile led the SunTeam to the river and pointed out the stone where Shaka apparently rested and drank water. She said if the stone was not cleansed, the royal family would have bad luck. “I’ve had this dream for a long time, but I didn’t know how to pass the message to the king as I’m a commoner. “I asked many people about this stone, but no one seemed to know about it.” Induna David Mbeko was aware of the site. He said Mtolo told him about it. He said a few years back, they collected funds from locals to have a ceremony at the site but had to cancel it because they were told they couldn’t do it without approval from the king. They didn’t have anyone to communicate with the royal family. The stone has a sign on it, believed to have been erected by an unknown historian, which says Shaka visited the area in 1828. The king’s spokesman, Prince Thulani Zulu, said he’d not heard about the stone but would like to visit it before informing the king. Head of arts, recreation and culture in the eThekwini Municipality, Thembinkosi Ngcobo, didn’t know about the site. According to historians, Shaka drank from the river on his way to attack the amaMpondo in the Eastern Cape and is said to have named it Amanzimtoti.
