KAIZER CHIEFS winger Joseph “Tight” Molangoane’s football career looks bleak. The pint-sized winger looks set to be forced into early retirement due to a career-threatening foot injury he sustained a couple of seasons ago. The 31-year-old fractured his leg in a 50-50 challenge with then Free State Stars tough tackling-midfielder Makhehleni Makhaula in the MTN8 quarterfinal against Ea Lla Koto at FNB Stadium last year. Amakhosi medics then ruled him out for the rest of the season. Miraculously, he returned in April, coming off the bench to replace Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya for a brief spell against Golden Arrows at FNB Stadium. He was never to be seen in the Amakhosi squad again following that substitution. He was only fit to be on the bench in club’s last league game of last season against his former club Chippa. According to SunSport sources, the former Orlando Pirates and Chippa United player is said to be sorting out his paperwork so he can claim insurance from the PSL. “The guy is retiring. His injury is still very bad,” said the mole. “At the moment, he’s busy sorting out papers to get insurance. Probably, Chiefs will release a statement of his injury situation. It is just sad that the country never saw the best of him.” When asked for comment, Chiefs spokesperson Vina Maphosa painted a dim picture about the midfielder. “On my script, Molangoane removed the two screws last week from his leg fractured surgery,” said Maphosa. Last month, Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp also declared a bleak future for the player and was not sure as to when he’d be back in the team. “At the moment, it’s a very clear message that he’s unable to play a competitive game. He’s working individually. “It’s worth noting that Tight’s injury has lots of complications and during the off-season, it flared up again. It’s the reason why he hasn’t been with the team despite signing an extension for one-year deal in May.”
