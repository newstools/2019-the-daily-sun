SUPERSTAR DJ Black Coffee has spoken regarding his current marital troubles with Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa. Black Coffee has been receiving backlash on social media since the news that his marriage is coming to an end surfaced. On Tesday, Twitter lashed out at Coffee, calling him insensitive for wishing his collaborater David Guetta a Happy Birthday, while he kept quite about his marital troubles. This has led to the DJ releasing a statement asking for privacy. READ:WATCH: ENHLE SPEAKS OUT! Said Coffee: “After much deliberation since the news of
our relationship broke in public, I wish to state that we have been trying to
sort our problems amicably and in private for almost a year now and it has been
the most heart breaking and challenging period.” Black Coffee said that as much as there’s two side to
every story, he will not discuss his private life in public, let alone speak
ill of “my partner or my in-laws, as this can only hurt the people we love
dearly”. “As Mbali has stated our priority is to protect our
children at this point. This is now a court matter and we ask for privacy,”
said Coffee.  READ:IT'S BEEN A VERY ROUGH YEAR! A Statement. pic.twitter.com/gk1T1E5P85
