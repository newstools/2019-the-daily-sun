BASANI Baloyi will be back in the Gauteng North High Court in Tshwane today. The former chief operating officer in the office of the Public Protector will be challenging her dismissal by her former boss, Busisiwe Mkhwebane. READ: BOSS FORCED ME TO SUCK HIS 4-5! The matter was postponed because the court roll was too full. Mkhwebane claimed she dismissed Baloyi for not having the required skills for her job, but Baloyi wants the court to declare the Public Protector abused her office and violated the Constitution. In court papers, Baloyi, who was fired last month, said she believed she was dismissed because she stood in the way of Mkhwebane and CEO Vusi Mahlangu using their powers for personal advancement. Baloyi wants a personal cost order against the Public Protector and Mahlangu. She also wants a declaratory order that Mkhwebane abused her powers. These include the CR17 campaign funding and Sars rogue unit investigations. READ: 'I TOLD MY WIFE BEFORE THE AUDIO WAS LEAKED!' However, Mkhwebane has denied the allegations, calling them scandalous and irrelevant. She said Baloyi’s application should be struck off the roll with costs. The Public Protector is represented by Advocate Dali Mpofu while Baloyi hired the services of Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
