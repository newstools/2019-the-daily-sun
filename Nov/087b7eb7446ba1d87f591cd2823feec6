Nkosinathi “Mabhere” Joyi is gunning for the vacant (IBO) mini flyweight title against Filipino opponent Joey Canoy. FORMER two-time world champion Nkosinathi “Mabhere” Joyi has dropped to his natural weight to challenge for the vacant International Boxing Organisation (IBO) mini flyweight title on 14 December at East London’s ICC HotelJoyi moved up the division to campaign in the light flyweight class after he surrendered the same title to Hekkie Budler at Emperors Palace six years ago. He is making a dramatic return to face a dangerous Filipino opponent Joey Canoy. The seasoned fighter from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape is on the mission to reclaim back his crown. Despite competing as a junior flyweight in the past six years the hard-hitting fighter who ruled the smallest division in boxing with iron fist and listed a pound for pound fighter said he won’t struggle to make a weight. Said Joyi: “I have moved to light flyweight division seeking for new challenges not because of weight problem. I can still make a weight easily in the mini flyweight. I’m very excited to compete in the division once more. To be honest it never crossed my mind that I would still get a title shot at that division. The title belongs here in South Africa and I won’t allow Canoy to take it away,” he said.The title has been held by South African champions since 2006 when Joyi knocked out Canoy’s countryman Amando de le Cruz to claim the then vacant title. It was relinquished by Simphiwe Khonkco when he went to challenge for WBC world title last month. Other local fighter who once owned the belt are Budler and Gideon Buthelezi
