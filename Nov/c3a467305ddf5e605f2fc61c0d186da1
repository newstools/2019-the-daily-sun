THE man accused of stabbing two homeless men remains in custody. Manusi Mothupi (40) appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday, but the matter was postponed to Monday. Mothupi allegedly tried to kill the second victim in Sunnyside in May, leaving many residents horrified. He arrived in court confident, but he looked disappointed after the postponement. The investigating office told the court Mothupi’s father was a pensioner and last saw his son in February. “When the suspect was arrested, he had no phone,” he said. The officer said a sharp object was used in the attacks. Mothupi was bust in June and charged with attempted murder. He made his first appearance in July. Mothupi was also charged in connection with the attempted murder of another homeless man in Muckleneuk in February. However, the police and NPA said he had not been connected with the murder of five homeless men in the area in June.
