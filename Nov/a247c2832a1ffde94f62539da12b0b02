WHEN it comes to workers’ rights, there can be no doubting the SA Federation of Trade Unions general secretary. Zwelinzima Vavi sat down with us on the latest Under the Umbrella episode. His take on workers is that they’re doomed. He says the ANC-led government is ruining the country to please the West. He says former president Nelson Mandela sold out, and that governing party policies don’t benefit black people. His dream before he calls it quits, he says, is to see a united workers’ union coming into existence. Vavi says it would be difficult for Cosatu to come on board after the union federation unceremoniously kicked him out. He tells us Saftu has reached out to the federation in an attempt to unify but had no joy. Vavi also reveals that he’s very unhappy with the slow growth of his federation and that it needs to grow its membership.
