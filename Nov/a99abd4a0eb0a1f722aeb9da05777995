A HEIDELBERG teacher was rushed to hospital after a grade 4 pupil allegedly threw his pencil case at her. The teacher was hit in the face but was discharged from hospital on the same day after receiving medical attention. The Sakhile Primary School pupil has since been suspended following the incident last Tuesday, confirmed Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona. It’s understood the pupil left through a broken fence and returned to the school accompanied by his gogor and aunt. “The circuit manager and the school principal related the incident and informed them that their child was suspended with immediate effect, which they acknowledged,” said Mabona. “The parents were assured departmental procedures would unfold and the pupil would be allowed to write his exams.” A hearing will take place after 20 November. Said Mabona: “It’s indeed regrettable and embarrassing that a learner could harm a person that should teach, nurture, and mentor him. “Teachers play a significant role in our schooling environment. We always advocate for their respect. “Learners must be reminded that teachers are their parents and should be treated as such.” The teacher is recovering at home and the department’s employee wellness officials have offered her support. – NEWS24
