 TWO tenderpreneurs were arrested as they tried to bribe a Special Investigating Unit official investigating the irregular awarding of a borehole tender. The Mopani District Municipality in Limpopo has for years been involved in allegations of borehole tender fraud. A report has recommended that the service providers pay back R3 million unlawfully paid to them and also face criminal charges. The company submitted documents to the municipality for payments, even though no work had been done. Unit national spokesman Kaizer Kganyago told Daily Sun the two men linked to the fraud couldn’t wait for the report to be released. He said they tried to bribe a unit investigator to exclude the portion of the report that recommended their company be charged criminally. They further asked the amount to be paid back to be reduced. “On Wednesday at a Polokwane hotel, the suspects met the investigator and handed over a R300 000 gratification, which led to their arrest. “Efforts are already underway to forfeit the R300 000 bribe money to the state, and also to ascertain whether the suspects are liable to pay back the R3 million,” said Kganyago. He said both suspects, aged between 34 and 44, appeared in the Polokwane Magistrates Court and were granted R50 000 bail each. Mopani municipal spokesman Odas Ngobeni said the municipality had not seen the unit’s report. “If there is wrongdoing from any of our officials, then consequence management will be implemented without fail,” said Ngobeni.
