 Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has filed a notice of
intention to oppose an application by the SA Revenue Service to stop her
accessing the tax records of former president Jacob Zuma "[She] filed a notice to oppose. The answering
affidavit will be filed soon," said her spokesperson Oupa Segalwe on
Monday afternoon. Earlier on Monday Business Day reported that the tax agency
had launched an urgent court bid to prevent Mkhwebane from getting the former
president's tax information. In October, Mkhwebane issued a subpoena to obtain
Zuma's taxpayer information, the publication reported. As Fin24 reported, Mkhwebane is investigating a 2017
complaint from the DA that Zuma allegedly received undeclared money from a
security company during (at least) the first four months of his presidency. The claim was made in investigative journalist Jacques
Pauw's book The Presidentâ€™s Keepers, which alleged that Zuma received R1m a
month from Royal Security, a company owned by Roy Moodley. Pauw wrote that
neither Zuma, nor Moodley, declared these payments to SARS. SOURCE: NEWS24
