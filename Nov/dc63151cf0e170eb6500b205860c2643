ERNST Middendorp often wears his heart on his sleeve. Never one to hide behind platitudes, the Kaizer Chiefs coach would have surprised anyone with the jibe he aimed at the Amakhosi fans and the club management. His comments have followed the team’s 4-0 crushing league win against Stellenbosch, victory win lifted the TKO semifinal exit gloom. It appears the German could not resist taking a dig at his critics after the crushing win. “I was quite irritated to hear some comments inside the club totally confusing,” said Middendorp, who won the Absa Coach of the Month award on Thursday. Daniel Akpeyi took the Player of the Month award. “I think actually each and everybody, fans, technical team, management, should be humble. "To say we’re coming out of a season in position nine, not achieving anything. We should not run away and carry on just because we have the expectation, we have a history. “I think it’s absolutely important that we stay humble with the situation we’re in, go with the right attitude to the next game and not criticise and destroy ourselves with a useless attitude and think we’re on cloud nine.” Amakhosi have no fixture this weekend. But they have retained their 10-point over nearest-rivals Mamelodi Sundowns at the top of the Absa Premiership.
