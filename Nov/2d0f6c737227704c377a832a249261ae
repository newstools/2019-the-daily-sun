GOLDEN Arrows chairperson Mato Madlala won’t allow her club to be exploited by kit suppliers. She claimed sports kit manufacturers in South Africa have unrealistic demands. On top of that the sports goods companies want advertising boards to be placed at every game, which gives them more mileage, something she refused. She said there are sponsors who have knocked on her door but she has turned them down because what they bring to the table and what she brings are far apart. In the PSL, Arrows are the only club that doesn’t have a kit sponsor. “Some of these brands give you two golf shirts, two pairs of shorts, a tracksuit and four kits. On top of that they say I should buy a thousand replicas. No,” Madlala said. “When you calculate the cost of replicas that you have to buy, it goes beyond the (cost of the) kit and they say they are sponsoring me. It doesn’t end there. “I have to put their boards up at every game. Each board costs about R5-million per season. When we sell it (the board) at matches, maybe we sell it for R15-million. “I don’t sell, I’m not in the business of selling, I’m here to play football.” She added: “A sponsor should understand what they want from me. If they want mileage, I’ll give them mileage but I can’t pay for it. I don’t know what arrangements are in other clubs, but no brand has given me a good proposal.” Madlala is not the only chairperson who has been infuriated by the demands of kit sponsors in South Africa. Her provincial rivals Maritzburg United weren’t happy with what their kit supplier was bringing to the table. They wanted the Team of Choice to buy kit, something that the chairman Farouk Kadodia wasn’t happy about. That deal only lasted one season. In the world of football, kit sponsors provide clubs with free kit and also offer money. In the PSL, clubs who enjoy that are Orlando Pirates (Adidas), Kaizer Chiefs (Nike) and Mamelodi Sundowns (Puma).
