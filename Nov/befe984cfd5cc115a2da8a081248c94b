MARITZBURG United coach Eric Tinkler says Jeremy Brockie has brought lady luck in the team despite his failure to score a single goal since he joined the club during the PSL transfer window in August. Tinkler told the media after his side drew goalless against Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium that the most important thing is that Brockie has contributed to his side’s seven match unbeaten run in all competitions. The Team Of Choice are now 10th on the league table with 12 points from nine matches and they have also secured a place in the Telkom Knockout semi-final where they will face Kaizer Chiefs at Mbombela Stadium on 23 November. Said Tinkler: “We brought Jeremy here to score goals. He is part of our structure, the way we want to play. The fact of the matter is since Jeremy has been in the starting line-up we haven’t lost, so sometimes it’s not only about the goals, it’s also about what he is doing for us to collect maximum points. But I know that Jeremy’s main objective is to score goals and he works extremely hard in training on that. Now it’s also about applying himself, I thought first half he could have done better. ”The former Bucs coach insist that Brockie cannot be blamed for his team’s failure to score as he is not getting supply. “But realistically today can we blame the striker (for the draw)? How many opportunities did we really create for Jeremy? We didn’t do that, so pointing a finger at the striker would be entirely incorrect. If it was a situation where he was missing in front of goal then I can start criticising, but I can’t criticise because he is not getting those opportunities. There was one in the second half from a corner that he caught (kicked) on a half volley, that’s the only chance he had during the period he played. He will keep working, we know what qualities he has. Like I said, we are winning, we haven’t lost now since he has been in the team, which is important.”
