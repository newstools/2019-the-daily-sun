Friends, family and fellow students came in numbers to bid farewell to murdered Capricorn's TVET College student Precious Ramabulana. Ramabulana was murdered when a man raped and stabbed her 52 times on Sunday night. Emotions ran high when some of her friends ascended the podium to say their last words. Friend, Kulani Mogale (20) broke down in tears and assisted to continue with her speech. "Precious loved prayer with all of her heart, everytime when I share my problems with her, the only thing she would say is that "let's close our eyes and pray,". She loved education a lot and wanted to change her family situation but she is no more to do that." Kulani said.  Precious funeral was attended by Minister Maite Nkoana Mashabane, Minister Buti Manamela, Premier Stan Mathabatha, MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale, MEC Dickson Masemola including both Vhembe District Municipality mayor Dowelani Nenguda and Makhado mayor Samuel Munyai. Precious's body is expected to be laid to rest at the local graveyard this evening atÂ  Tshirowe village in Nzhelele, Limpopo. Precious is being laid to rest in the evening because she is from the Ramabulana's Royal House.
