THE Premier Soccer League Desciplinary Committee has handed a six months ban to Cape Town City midfielder Mpho Makola. The 33-year-old was found guilty of assaulting match official Abongile Tom and also bringing the league into disrepute during Telkom Knockout last-16 fixture between The Citizens and Kaizer Chiefs at Cape Town Stadium on 19 October 2019. Makola pushed referee Tom after he was not impressed with the officials decision of Chiefs being awarded a penalty.
