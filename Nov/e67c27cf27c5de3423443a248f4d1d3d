We know rats to be scared of cats and dogs... But it seems the opposite is happening in Alexandra, Joburg, according to a video that is being shared on social media. A huge rat can be seen putting up a fight with a dog and a cat. The cat appears to have thrown in the towel during the fight as the dog is the one doing the chase. But the rat is putting up a fierce fight against the dog.
