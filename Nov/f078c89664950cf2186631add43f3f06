PEACEFUL Kgomo is living proof that HIV isn’t a death sentence. The 24-year-old from Siyabuswa in KwaNdebele, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun she tested positive at 19. READ: ‘WE PRAYED, THEN SHE DIED!’ At first it was difficult to accept, but she managed to achieve more as a person living with HIV than she otherwise would have. Peaceful said she’d helped thousands of people across Mzansi and neighbouring countries. Peaceful said she had hosted an annual dialogue to get people to talk about their problems and get help to overcome them. “I took control of my life when I started living out the purpose God had intended me to live for,” she said. She also started the Peaceful Kgomo Foundation to help people struggling to come to terms with their status or that of a loved one. “There are far more deadlier things than HIV, and living with it doesn’t mean your life has come to an end. It has actually just started,” she said. READ: WATCH: COPS 1- 0 TSOTSIS! She said her own life was proof to others anything was possible. “I’m in a relationship with a man who’s HIV negative, and we have a child who’s also HIV negative. People ask me how that’s possible. “It’s all possible because of my lifestyle. I avoided stress, took my pills as instructed, which made my viral load low, and we were able to have a baby without infecting him.”
