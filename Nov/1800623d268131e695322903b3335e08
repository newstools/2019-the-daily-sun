ARE you saving monthly as you should? Okay, you are not saving. Do you know of anyone who is saving enough? Chances are you know of a few people. Everyone is living hand-to-mouth as times are tough. Research from Budget Insurance showed that just over half (52%) of Mzansi people between 18 and 55 said they were saving for an emergency but would not be able to cover an unexpected expense of R10 000. That’s why the insurance company encourages people to budget for two separate savings funds: a rainy day fund and an emergency fund. Budget Insurance’s Susan Steward said the rainy day fund is for smaller amounts and short-term expenses, whereas an emergency fund is there to support you if there’s a sudden disruption to your income, such as job loss. She said rainy day funds are generally one-off costs which you need to cover but haven’t been planned for and will help to keep you out of debt and overspending. The money would normally be held in a savings account which you can access within 24 hours. In short, this fund will get you through to your next payslip. The emergency fund, on the other hand, will cover you in the unfortunate event that you are retrenched or suffer a sudden illness. It will cover items such as rental, bond repayments, vehicle repayments and living costs. This money should be put into an interest bearing account, such as a 32-day notice account. You could also put this money into an access bond which can help save interest on your repayments. Essentially, it’s the money you have to fall back on. “Our survey showed that people would either need to borrow more money from friends or family and take out a loan to cover shortfalls. But by having and budgeting for the two separate savings accounts, you will protect not only your income but also the money you put away for any emergency, big or small,” said Steward.
