BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki is already plotting Ghana’s downfall for their second-round meeting in Mzansi next year. The former national Under-17 coach lost 2-0 against the Black Stars in his first competitive match in the Africa Cup of Nations Cameroon 2021 qualifier in the West African country on Thursday. But he says that he will be much wiser in their second meeting. According to Ntseki, the pitch in the Cape Coast was in a terrible state and it made things worse for Bafana as they we not able to play their free-flowing football. But Ntseki believes that the four times African champions are beatable and are not strong as they used to be in the past. The Black Stars are in a re-building process and have introduced a lot of young players in their team. Ntseki said he will have settled into his role of the head coaching position by the time the West Africans visit Mzansi. Ntseki said: “We didn’t lose to Ghana because we were outplayed. We committed errors that cost us. We lost concentration before the break and conceded a goal. We prevented them from playing from the back and caused them all sorts of headaches. We can beat them when they come here, and I believe that we will have grown in confidence.” Ntseki had a chat with Black Stars coach Kwesi Appiah and they spoke about blooding in youngsters. Ntseki is also planning to refresh the Bafana squad. Ntseki added: “We will introduce a couple of youngsters next year to bring a balance to the team. We will be ready for Ghana when it’s their turn to visit us here next year. Our youngsters have U-17, U-20 and U-23 experience under their belts. We are looking forward to meeting Ghana and causing an upset next year.”
