SAMSON Malinga has been suffering for 40 years because of painful lumps on his body. The 55-year-old from Delpark in Delmas, Mpumalanga, said he developed the condition when he was still young. “My body became itchy and when I scratched it, blood would come out. A few hours after scratching, a big painful lump would develop.  My late parents tried to help me but couldn’t,” said Samson. He said sangomas and medical doctors couldn’t help him. “The lumps on my body have ruined my life. I must remain half-naked when it’s hot and sit next to a fan. “I can’t walk outside and expose myself to the sun.” Samson said he needed help with his condition so he could live a normal life.

Doctors once tried to cut the lumps, but the scars remained itchy,” he said. Sangoma Mehlwemamba Sikhosana said Samson’s condition might be caused by a curse. “Samson needs a strong inyanga to heal him. He was cursed at a very young age and his condition is very serious,” he said. Dr Bob-John Masango said Samson may be suffering from eczema, which causes his skin to become dry, causing the bleeding when he scratches himself. “He needs to get a clinical examination so he can be given a proper diagnosis. He can still come to me if he can so that I can try to get to the bottom of the problem,” said Masango.
