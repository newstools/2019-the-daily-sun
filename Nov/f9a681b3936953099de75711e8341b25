FORMER colleagues of the top traffic cop who threw another cop’s cellphone into the water say they are happy she’s gone. Provincial Inspector Ausie Lebone was the manager of Wepener, Zastron, Rouxville, Smithfield, Reddersburg and Bethulie in the Free State before she was arrested. Daily Sun published the story last October after many traffic cops said the woman was a bully.  On Friday, Lebone was found guilty and sentenced to five months in prison or a fine of R10 000. She is no longer the manager of those areas and cops said they were happy. “She used to say she had connections in the department. The phone she threw in the water was never found. “We were happy she was arrested and that gave us the courage to blow the whistle on bully bosses,” said one.  “I feel sorry for her colleagues in Bloemfontein. The owner of the phone was happy justice was served but we think a harsher sentence would have been better.” Daily Sun called Lebone, who said she was going into a meeting and supplied her attorney’s number. Nthabiseng Lekhotla from Lekhotla Attorneys said: “We are willing to respond fully to all your queries at a pre-arranged date.” she suggested dates from 21 November onwards. Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “Lebone was found guilty of malicious damage to property and paid a fine of R10 000”.
