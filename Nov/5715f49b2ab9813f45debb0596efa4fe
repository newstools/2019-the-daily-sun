A SHORTAGE of doctors has become a huge problem. Last Tuesday at Butterworth Hospital in the Eastern Cape, there was only one doctor available to help patients. Ntsanta Buza from Nqabara Village, near Willowvale, told Daily Sun he went to the hospital with a broken leg and spent the whole day and night without being attended to. “Our public health facilities are failing us. I was in the hospital for many hours but didn’t even get pills for the pain or to calm me down,” he said. READ: WATCH: SPINNING A BMW M3 GONE WRONG!  Ntsanta said he spent R1 200 on hired transport which took him to the hospital. “I told myself I’d wait until I got help, but there was only one doctor. I slept on a chair because I couldn’t afford to hire transport again,” he said.

We slept on chairs and some people used cardboard to sleep on the floor,” she said. Eastern Cape health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the hospital had 10 full-time and six session doctors. He said the department was in the process of appointing six more.
