YOUNG Buhle Ncapai is ready to show her talent to the world. The 17-year-old house DJ said: “I have what it takes to be a well-known musician, and when I’m on set people love my work.” Buhle from Midrand, Joburg, was inspired by Oratilwe Hlongwane, who’s also known as DJ Arch Junior. “I used to follow him on his social media platforms. This inspired me because if, at that age he could do it, so could I. I realised DJ Arch Junior was a star. “This made me realise I could do what I love, which is deejaying at local pubs and school events.” Buhle plays house and amapiano, the in-thing, and whenever she plays people are happy. “I started learning about deejaying earlier this year at Rise Academy,” she said. Buhle said she’s doing what she loves and following her passion. “I’m working on a compilation of different sounds. I just play sets at events for now.” She’s working on a mix she’s ready to give fans. “I should release it next month. Many are going to love it.” Buhle would like to work with DJ DBN Gogo, Focalistic, Moonchild, Samthing Soweto, Black Motion and Shimza.
