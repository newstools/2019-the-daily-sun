ONE person was killed and 15 others seriously injured in a horror accident near the Bellville Road offramp in Durban yesterday morning. Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said the accident involved six cars and three trucks on the M7 Durban bound at about 8am. “Paramedics arrived on the scene to chaos. Multiple vehicles were involved, with three catching fire after impact.” He said patients were found on both carriageways.  “More ambulances and advanced life support paramedics were immediately dispatched.” The Durban fire department was on the scene to assist. “Fifteen patients were found along the scene and two had sustained serious injuries. Helicopters were called.” Helicopters flew the seriously injured patients to hospital as the freeway was closed to traffic. “The remaining patients were transported by ambulance,” he said.  The highway remained closed yesterday while cops were investigating. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said at about 9am yesterday, a tanker truck apparently crashed into several cars and burst into flames on the M7. “Cars caught fire. Occupants were seriously injured and one person died. “The tanker truck driver has been taken into custody. Victims were taken to hospital.” Police were investigating a case of culpable homicide.
