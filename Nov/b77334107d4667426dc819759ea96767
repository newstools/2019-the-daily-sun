KAIZER Chiefs’ coach Ernst Middendorp’s big gamble to rest key players ahead of their Absa Premiership derby against Orlando Pirates paid off. With one eye on the Soweto derby against arch-rivals Orlando Pirates on Saturday, the German tactician made wholesale changes against Chippa United. Amakhosi’s fringe players showed the faith that their coach gave them when they helped the Soweto giants to a comprehensive 2-0 victory over the Chilli Boys at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth last night. Dumisani Zuma bagged a brace for Amakhosi as they collected the maximum points. Middendorp made eight changes to the team that defeated Pirates in their Telkom Knockout quarterfinal encounter in Durban last week. Only three played that played in the derby were included against the winless Chilli Boys. He prioritized the derby match over Chippa encounter in the Windy City. Chiefs consolidated their lead at the summit of the log to 25 points from 10 matches. At the end of the night, Middendorp’s experiment paid off as his team emerged victorious and they are now going into the derby high on confidence. The Chilli Boys are still the only team not to have won a game in the league this season. Chippa defeated Amakhosi on five occasions, losing just once and drawing two matches since they were promoted into the top flight in 2012. But they failed to collect the maximum points as they remain rooted to the basement of the table with four points from 10 games. Norman Mapeza’s charges threw everything at the Soweto giants in the first half. Chippa had a nightmare in the first half losing three players due to injury and were forced to use all their available substations and that affected their performance after the half-time break. The home side did not come to the part in the second half as Amakhosi steeped a gear.
