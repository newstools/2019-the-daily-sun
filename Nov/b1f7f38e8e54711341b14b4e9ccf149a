Ntwagae - may his soul Rest In Peace - made his professional debut for Platinum Stars in 2002 where he established himself as one of the most difficult and robust defenders of his generation.  The man with a re-arranged dental formula did NOT think twice about kicking troublesome strikers and as a result, he caught the eye of Mzansi’s big clubs. In 2005 he joined big spenders Mamelodi Sundowns and played for the Brazilians for three seasons. He later moved on to neighbours SuperSport United. He played 15 matches for Bafana Bafana in his short but impressive career.  He had rejoined Platinum Stars when he was killed in a car accident in 2010. He was knocked down by a speeding car in Germiston on the East Rand. Please share with us your fondest memory of Ntwagae…
