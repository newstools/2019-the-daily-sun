A policeman was robbed of his cellphone and shot dead while
walking to his home in Delft South, Cape Town, in the early hours of Wednesday
morning, said Western Cape police. Unknown gunmen had driven up to Sergeant Thanduxolo Wiseman
Stuma, 43, around 00:45, robbed him and fired a shot before fleeing, said
Brigadier Novela Potelwa. Stuma, who was stationed as a detective at Elsies River
police station and was off duty at the time, died on the scene. Elsies River station commander Brigadier Sandile Sonjani
described Stuma as a "quiet, humble and disciplined police official". He visited Stuma's family to pay his respects and said his
colleagues were saddened by the loss. Stuma joined the police service in January 2006. Western Cape acting police commissioner Lieutenant General
Sindile Mfazi vowed that those responsible would face the full might of the
law. Early on Wednesday morning, the provincial flying squad
arrested two people who were allegedly found in possession of Stuma's
cellphone, 16 other cellphones, two firearms and items taken in a business
robbery in Bellville. Police investigations have not yet determined whether the
firearms seized were linked to Stuma's murder. "Our investigations currently are focusing on
determining which other serious crimes the suspects are linked to as we curb
violent crimes in this province," said Mfazi. Funeral arrangements will be announced later this week. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/cape-town-cop-robbed-shot-dead-while-walking-home-20191127
