FOLLOWING a
cash-in-transit heist you would expect onlookers to be scared and staying clear
of the crime scene. But this wasnâ€™t the
case earlier this week on the R566 near Cape Town when onlookers helped themselves
to what was left of the cash van money. In a video that has
surfaced on social media, a large number of people can be seen looting a cash van
that was blown up. The area appears to be
isolated and the people looting the cash van seem to be coming their cars to
loot.  #CITRobbery Awaiting more details... pic.twitter.com/eBhBnm2u4X
