JUSTICE Mabuza’s dead son is haunting him. It’s been happening since his 19-month-old daughterwas hospitalised after being burnt with water at home. He said the dead baby tells him he needs to move his sister Boikgantso Mabuza from hospital or something bad is going to happen. Justice (44) from SNS in Mamelodi East, Tshwane fears she would also die and told Daily Sun he wanted her to be released to another institution.  The month-old child was admitted to Mamelodi Day Hospital on 5 September and died on 9 September. Doctors said he suffered from meningitis. “He cried for four days. I failed him. He’s not resting peacefully,” said the father of six. Justice has begged them to release his child to Steve Biko Academic but they refused. “I’m not at peace,” he said.  Acting CEO of Mamelodi Regional Hospital, Dr Terrence Makhudu said Justice’s dead child was timeously attended by doctors and referred to the paediatrics team. “A diagnosis was made and treatment started at once under a specialist paediatrician.” He said the child developed complications and Steve Biko Academic Hospital was called but it was decided he would stay at the Mamelodi hospital. “The child died of his complications.” Makhudu said the child burnt with water was admitted on 1 September. “She was attended to and referred to surgeons. She had moderate burns but is stable and making good progress .There’s no indication to transfer the child. The father wanted to refuse hospital treatment but the Child Act doesn’t permit this.” He said losing a child in the same ward had made things worse and counselling was arranged. “The child is being looked after by surgeons and paediatricians.”
