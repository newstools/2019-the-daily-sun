The Special
Investigating Unit's (SIU) Special Tribunal has issued summonses to 13
non-profit organisations implicated in unjustified enrichment emanating from the
Life Esidimeni scandal. The
summonses were issued on Monday, tribunal spokesperson Selby Makgotho told
News24 on Wednesday. "At
the moment we have issued summonses against the 13 defendants and are waiting
for the return of service," he said Makgotho
said the organisations allegedly submitted fraudulent invoices and ended up
being overpaid. The tribunal was expected to recover an amount of R5.5m from
the organisations through civil litigation, Makgotho said. On Monday,
the new tribunal announced that it had received its first batch of cases to
commence with civil proceedings against government departments and state organs
in an effort to recover the billions looted from the state. The
tribunal was established by President Cyril Ramaphosa in February, after an
announcement to that effect in his State of the Nation Address, News24
previously reported. In
September, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola gazetted
the regulations for the SIU's Special Tribunal These
regulations came into effect upon their publication in the Government Gazette.
The value of cases ready for adjudication and recovery stands at R14.7bn. Makgotho
said the tribunal also had a mandate to recover public funds siphoned from the
fiscus through fraud and illicit money flows. He said
that the president of the tribunal, Judge Gidfonia Mlindelwa Makhanya, had met
with its members and "expressed the need to move with the required speed
on the work, especially because it has only three years in which to operate and
finalise its work". Makhanya
will chair the tribunal for three years and is assisted by seven other judges:
Icantharuby Pillay, Johannes Eksteen, Selewe Peter Mothle, Lebogang Modiba, Thina
Siwendu, David van Zyl and Sirajudien Desai. SOURCE:
