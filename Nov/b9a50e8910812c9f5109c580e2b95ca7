AS the Polokwane Municipality in Limpopo looks forward to earning extra revenue through the new on-street parking system, motorists are not too pleased by the move. The system came into effect on Friday. Some motorists complained that those who stayed long while visiting government offices would have to pay more. Parking in city streets for just an hour will see a motorist parting with R8. Anyone who loses his or her ticket will have to pay a R72 penalty. Municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said the lack of parking space in the city prompted the move. He said the system would assist motorists as their cars would be guarded by the marshals. “They will have access to adequate, clean and safe parking areas to avoid break-ins by thugs. “The system also creates job opportunities for locals. We’re urging motorists to use the system as it will be to their benefit. “Motorists must co-operate with marshals on the streets,” said Selala. He said the system would be implemented in phases. At the moment, it will operate between Grobler and Bodeinstein streets via Landros mare, Schoeman and Hans van Rensburg streets. Motorists will only park for free on Sundays and public holidays.
