IT is safe to say Orlando Pirates coach, Rhulani Mokwena, was not a happy man following his side’s defeat to arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday. Bucs were downed 3-2 in a thrilling Soweto derby played at the FNB Stadium. The match, which had everything, was tainted somewhat by ugly scenes near the end when players from both sides clashed – leading to referee Thando Nzanzeka booking four players for that particular incident. Chiefs Erick Mathoho was sent off after he pushed Bucs’ Abel Mabaso. Meanwhile, his teammate Samir Nurkovic and Bucs duo Ntsikelelo Nyauza and Mabaso received yellow cards. Speaking to the media after match, Mokwena did not hold back as he described his opponent’s behaviour as ‘thuggish.’ “I hear Coach Ernst Middendorp saying that he doesn’t know what happened with the red card, I watched it again and it is just not just Mathoho that should have been sent off, it is real thuggish behaviour, it doesn’t belong on the pitch, it is very bad for football,” said a furious Mokwena. “It starts with Katsande’s tackle on Fortune Makaringe in the first half, over the top, career threatening tackle and thuggish as well. Those are the situations that I am talking about, those things does not belong in South African football. “I’ve got a player bleeding now with a broken nose because he was punched in the face. “Kaizer Chiefs is good enough to beat us on tactics, on personnel, well coached team - excellent, but not on diving inside, Parker’s excellent dive, not on thuggish tackles and not on boxing, we don’t train boxing.”
