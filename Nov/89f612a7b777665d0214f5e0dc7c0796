KAIZER Chiefs have been dumped out of the Telkom Knockout. They were stunned 2-1 by Maritzburg United in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday. Judas Moseamedi scored a brace to help The Team of Choice dump Amakhosi out of the Ziwa More. Chiefs, who last won a trophy back in 2015 when they lifted the Absa Premiership, will have to wait longer to end their trophy drought. They came unstuck against Eric Tinkler’s army of soldiers on a mission to upset the odds and reach their first ever TKO final. Chiefs came into the match in a rich vein of form having gone unbeaten in their last eight matches in all competitions. But the form book was thrown out of the window with Maritzburg coming up trumps. They came out of the blocks quicker, creating numerous chances before eventually breaking the deadlock in the 30th minute through Moseamedi. The bulky striker capitalised on Daniel Cardoso’s poor back pass and rounded keeper Bruce Bvuma before slotting into an empty net. The goal sparked Chiefs into life as they attempted to take control of the match looking for the all-important equaliser. The goal came in through an unlikely source in the form of Yagan Sasman in the 78th minute. And just when it looked like Chiefs would romp to victory and set up a dream final against Mamelodi Sundown, up stepped man-of-match Moseamedi in the 85th to send the Team of Choice into their second Cup final across all competitions in the top flight. They will take on Downs at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 14 December.
