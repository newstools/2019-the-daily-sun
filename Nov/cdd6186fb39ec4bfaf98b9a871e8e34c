EVERY day the two would hitchhike to and from school to save money. But a man in a BMW kidnapped them last Tuesday. Maniki Tsheoga (17) and a 15-year-old relative from Tsantsabela Village, outside Marble Hall in Limpopo, used to hitchhike to Lepelle High School. WATCH: TWERKING, THEN BULLETS But this time a driver took them to an unknown location before dropping one of them off at a nearby village. Maniki is still missing. The teenage witness said the driver, who was light in complexion, pointed a gun at them and tied them up. The 15-year-old said: “He told us to lie in the back seat and drove to a house in a village I didn’t recognise. He took my relative into the house before driving me to Ga-Molapo Village and leaving me there.” DUMPED AFTER ENGAGEMENT! The driver apparently said he’d never release her relative if she told anyone what had happened. “He said I must say she went away with her boyfriend after school, but I couldn’t lie.” The 15-year-old’s mum (46) said residents and police were searching for Maniki every day. “It’s hard because she lost her mother a few months ago,” she said. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said two cases of kidnapping were opened. “We’re looking for the suspect. We’re pleading with anyone with information to call Warrant Officer Salome Lebelo on 082 414 6674, or to visit their nearest police station,” he said.
