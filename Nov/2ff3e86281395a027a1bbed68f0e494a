  THE SHERRIFF of the Court is expected to attach National
Freedom Party president Zanele Magwaza-Msibi’s assets Friday. This after she failed to meet a Wednesday deadline as she
promised. The Sheriff went to Zanele’s house at Umhlanga Ridge north
of Durban on Wednesday to empty the house in order to sell the asset to get
R283 000 owed by her, but her son Melusi Gumede apparently begged the sheriff
on Wednesday not to take anything and promised to pay before 4 o’clock that
day. Hlengiwe Luthuli who’s responsible for the collection of the
money at Kunene legal firm the company Zanele owe - told Daily Sun that the sheriff
went to attach NFP leader’s assets on Wednesday, but her son promised to pay
before 4 o’clock. She said sheriff left without taking anything, but the money
wasn’t paid. She said Melusi again promised to pay by 11 o’clock on Thursday,
but still the money wasn’t paid. “If things continue like this, I think the sheriff must just
go and attach the assets as per court order. We don’t understand this and don’t
know what is going on. Sherriff will have to go back there on Friday and his
job as we have the court order,” said Luthuli. Melusi refused to comment and said he doesn’t want to say
anything about. “Eish this is killing my brother, so I chose not to talk
about it,” said Melusi. NFP spokesman Canaan Mdletshe said there was nothing he
could say because the matter is being handled by Melusi. Magwaza-Msibi’s, acting secretary Mzwakhe Sibisi and acting
chairman Bhekithemba Dlamini lost a case against the party’s KZN legislature
member Vikizitha Mlotshwa after the three tried to stop him from being sworn in
as a member in May. The three lost a case in September and they were ordered to
pay cost of Mlotshwa’s two counsels.
