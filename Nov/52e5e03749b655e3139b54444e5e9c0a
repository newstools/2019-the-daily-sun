RUGBY World Cup-winning Springbok legend Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira has called it a day. The 34-year-old veteran of 117 Tests confirmed he will no longer be playing international rugby, having helped South Africa to World Cup glory. He couldn’t have signed out with any better performance than the majestic display in his final match as the Boks thumped England 32-12 in Yokohama.Mtawarira, who made his senior provincial debut for the Sharks in 2006, has won almost all there is to win in rugby, from the Currie Cup, the Tri-Nation and right up to the World Cup. “I’ve been privileged to play this great game and achieve many career goals over the last 12 years of playing senior rugby,” said Mtawarira. “I’ve been blessed to have been part of teams that achieved so much success over the years, and I have many memories to cherish forever. But I can honestly say that winning the Rugby World Cup is the perfect ending and cherry on top. ”He became the third most-capped Springboks, behind Victor Matfield and Bryan Habana, the most capped prop, made the most appearances for a South African Super Rugby team (159) and won the Rugby World Cup (2019), Tri-Nations (2009), Rugby Championship (2019), a series against the British & Irish Lions (2009) and the Currie Cup (2008, 2010 and 2013). He added: “I am grateful for the opportunities afforded to me by many top coaches at the Springboks and the Sharks, and grateful to my numerous team mates in green and gold, and black and white, over the years.” President of SA Rugby Mark Alexander paid tribute to Mtawarira, who won his first Springbok cap in in 2008. “Beast is someone who never complained, always put in the hard work and simply got on with his job in his typically unassuming way,” said Alexander.
