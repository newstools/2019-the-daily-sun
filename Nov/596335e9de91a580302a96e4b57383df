MUSA Phakathi believes her late mum is her guardian angel and she gave her a loving man. She now wants help to locate her mum’s family and her mum’s grave. The 21-year-old from Ivory Park, Tembisa, said her mum, Nobuhle Bhengu, was buried in Nquthu, KZN, but no one can locate her grave. Musa said she last saw her mum when she was five years old. “My mum left me with dad’s mum because she was tired of the abuse from that family. So I was raised by my gogo, who also abused me until I ran away from home to live in a homeless shelter. “Shortly after that, I moved in with my aunt, who also treated me badly,” said Musa. She said she only learnt what love is when she met her partner in June last year. “My fiance patiently pursued me for some time and I eventually gave in. We are getting married next month. “This is despite my gogo giving my fiance’s family a hard time when they came to pay lobolo. She sent them back until I begged her to accept it,” said Musa. Musa said all she knows is that her mum was from Durban. “Finding my mother’s family before my big day will bring me peace and will be the best wedding gift ever,” she said.
