IT was the only way for her to survive and she did it. The woman chopped off the rapist’s 4-5 while he was raping her. The woman got a chance to escape and then ran from the house naked and covered in blood to knock on neighbours houses. It’s reported that the alleged attacker is already on the sex offender’s register in South Carolina, USA, according to US media. According to the Greenville News paper Dennis Slaton is now out on bail after the alleged sexual assault. Jacqueline Fair, who lives across from the scene of the reported assault, heard someone banging desperately on the front door on the night. She reported hearing a woman's voice begging for help. Fair didn't open the door but looking at footage taken from her home's security camera, saw the woman on her front porch was completely naked and covered in what appeared to be blood. "I didn't open the door because you never know what's going on with that kind of stuff," she told The Greenville News. The Mirror reports that an incident report from the Greenville County Sheriff's Office says that woman continued running down the road, stopping periodically at homes in the neighbourhood to plead for help. She finally found a Waffle House restaurant about half a mile away, where staff helped her. Slaton, 61, is charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping in relation to that assault. He has been a registered sex offender since 1989, and a criminal background check shows dozens of criminal convictions, many of them violent, stretching back to 1977.
