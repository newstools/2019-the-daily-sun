A MENTALLY ill girl (10) was allegedly raped by four people at a disability centre in Tzaneen, Limpopo. The girl was allegedly raped several times by two men and two minors at Tshwaranang Disability Centre in Lephepane.  The girl’s cousin noticed she was bleeding and notified social workers, who reported the matter to cops. The child has since been moved to an undisclosed home and is receiving intensive psychological help. RAPIST SENTENCED TO 3 LIFE TERMS Limpopo Social Development spokesman Witness Tiva said they were investigating how children ended up at the centre meant for adults. He said they had also sent a team to investigate the circumstances surrounding the sexual abuse. “We also want to check if the environment at the centre is still suitable to take care of vulnerable people,” said Tiva. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said cops were investigating, but no arrests had been made. “We’re still waiting for a second assessment report from social workers.” Limpopo Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale condemned the incident. “What worries me the most is that this incident comes to light at a time the country is commemorating Disability Rights Awareness Month. I urge residents to speak out whenever they see incidents of gender-based violence,” said Rakgoale. She said social workers had already started providing psychosocial services to the victim and others at the centre. Tshwaranang Disability Centre is a government funded organisation which offers people living with disabilities valuable skills such as farming.
