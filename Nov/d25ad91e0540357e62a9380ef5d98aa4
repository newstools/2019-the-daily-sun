JAN Kekana (48) is worried about his one-year-old son. That’s after he and his wife had an argument.  He claims she then stormed out with their one-year-old son last Sunday. They live in the Joburg CBD. He claimed his wife (45) started screaming during the argument and said he was being unreasonable. “This isn’t the first time she’s left. She’s been doing this disappearing act for the past four years. I would look for her until I found her. I’m so tired of her behaviour.” READ: WAR OVER IDOLS TWINS! Jan said he always found her at taxi ranks, but he didn’t find her this time. He told Daily Sun they’d been married for 12 years and their relationship used to be the best. “Her behaviour started changing after five years of marriage,” he said. He claimed that she started being stubborn. “She’d leave during discussions when our families tried to intervene,” he said. Jan said he stayed all these years because he loved her and they have three kids together. Hillbrow police spokesman Captain Musa Shihambe confirmed that a missing persons case was opened but said there weren’t any leads yet.
