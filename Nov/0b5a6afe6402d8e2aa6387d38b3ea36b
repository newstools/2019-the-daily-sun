THE Qwabe twins have been released from their contracts! Viggy and Virginia have been seen with DJ Tira and just recorded a song with Durban-based Mondli Ngcobo. The song, Hamba, is expected to be released on Friday. Many expected drama, but Daily Sun learnt the twins have been released from their Think Entertainment and Gallo recording contracts. Mondli said: “Gallo has released the twins. DJ Tira negotiated with Gallo Records and showed me proof of their release. Everything seemed fine. They were released last Monday.” Mondli said it was important that the negotiations be completed because this could cause problems in future. “During negotiations the twins made it clear they had no interest in ever working with Gallo. But we know contracts can be complicated, leading to problems in the future.” Mondli said he composed and produced the song. “Tira also contributed to it. I own 75% of the song and Tira owns 25%. The twins will get their share in the sales of the song.” The twins’ dad Laurence said: “Their release is not formal, but they’ve been released from their recording contracts. We’re negotiating with Gallo Records to ensure a smooth transition.” But Tira said his business with them was only about the song. “At the moment I don’t have information. How they plan to release the song is entirely their business.” He denied negotiating their release. “They’re speaking to Gallo directly,” he said. Kim Coppen, their former publicity and booking agent, confirmed their release. “The twins have been released from both Gallo and Think Entertainment contracts. “I’ve released them without any strings attached, meaning they’re free to do whatever they want to do. I wish them all the best.” Rob Cowling from Gallo couldn’t be reached for comment as his phone rang unanswered. He did not respond to emails or text messages.
