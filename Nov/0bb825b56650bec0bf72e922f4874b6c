RESIDENTS are furious at the Limpopo Health Department. Piet Molamudi (41) volunteered at Nkidikitlana Clinic for nine years. But the department hired someone else when a permanent post opened earlier this year. 6 SUSPECTS BUST AFTER HIJACKING AND MURDERING A WOMAN Residents of Ga-Nkidikitlana Village, outside Steilloop, have since last Wednesday shut down the clinic, demanding Piet to be hired. When the SunTeam visited the village yesterday, community leader Malesela Mashamaite (43), said everyone was sure Piet would get the job when it was advertised. “We’re so disappointed an honest servant who worked for the clinic for free wasn’t the preferred candidate. “Management approached residents asking for a volunteer gardener, promising that person would get the post. WATCH: TWERKING, THEN BULLETS “They told us they were shocked the department hired someone else. They said they even helped Piet with his CV.” Piet said the clinic manager even wrote a letter for him. Residents claimed the clinic’s operational manager previously hired his wife and two relatives. Lucky Bambo (51) said when they closed the clinic last week, management failed to properly respond to their concerns. Health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said people should raise their concerns with the department. “If hiring is queried, this must be within the law. The facility shouldn’t be closed to disadvantage others.”
