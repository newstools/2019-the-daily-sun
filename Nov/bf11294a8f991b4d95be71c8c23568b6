COPS pulled over a black car during a stop and search on the N3 freeway in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, on Friday. When the driver opened the window, the first thing that caught cops eyes was the size of his giant 4-5! Police ordered the man to come out of the car and unzip his trousers. But to their shock, it wasn’t his 4-5 that was big, but he was hiding a 9mm pistol. A cop told the People’s Paper all heads turned when the man with a huge 4-5 came out of the car. “We were all shocked. We were wondering what kind of 4-5 it is. “It looked like this man had three or four 4-5s stuck together in his trousers,” he said. Vosloorus police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw told Daily Sun there were three occupants in the car. “Cops were really shocked at the size of his 4-5, but little did they know the 4-5 was actually a gun.” Rossouw said police pulled out the gun from the 4-5 and arrested the man. “It was found the gun was stolen in January in Meyerton in the Vaal,” he said. “The man was arrested for being in possession of a firearm without a licence and also charged with being in possession of ammunition without a licence,” he said. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said this weekend alone, several firearms were found. She said a stolen police firearm was found on a wanted suspect, who was also driving a suspected stolen vehicle on the N12 in Alberton. “This brings to total four firearms recovered after one was confiscated at a roadblock on the N3 and a suspect arrested and two firearms recovered during a hostel raid in Thokoza, where a suspect was arrested,” she said.
