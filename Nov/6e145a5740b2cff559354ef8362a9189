THEO Damba (22) was chilling with friends in Samora Machel squatter camp in Cape Town on Saturday when three cop vans arrived. The cops ordered them to lie down and to confess where they had hidden a gun used in a robbery. Said Theo: “I never robbed anyone. They kicked and dragged me. Some of them searched the house and were even on the roof.” WATCH: TWERKING, THEN BULLETS The victim apparently told cops the robber was wearing an orange T-shirt. “After the victim told them they had assaulted the wrong people, the cops didn’t show any remorse,” said Theo. His mum Thokozile (45) said she never thought her son would be attacked by the police. She was not at home when her neighbour phoned to tell her cops were breaking down her door. “I asked my neighbour to tell them I was coming to open the house,” she said. ZUMA OWES SCHOOL FEES! Thokozile later asked the cops to apologise. “They said I must take Theo to the hospital myself,” she told the People’s Paper. Manelisi Somlenze (23), who claimed he was also assaulted by the cops, said: “Instead of protecting us they’re the ones abusing us.” Constable Siyabulela Malo said a case of common assault had been registered. “At this stage no further information can be provided as it will hamper the investigation,” Malo told Daily Sun. Acting national spokesman Sontaga Seisa confirmd that Ipid received an assault complaint laid by a victim at Samora Machel. Seisa said no arrest had been made.
