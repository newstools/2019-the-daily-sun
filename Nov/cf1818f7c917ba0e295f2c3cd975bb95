Luyolo Yiba has been crowned Idols SA
season 15 winner. He closed the show with a stellar
performance of his single ‘Sunshine’. The face-off was between Sneziey Msomi
from Umlazi, Durban in KZN and Luyolo who hails from Buffalo River in King
Williams Town, Eastern Cape. This prestigious event took place at
Carnival City, Ekurhuleni, east of Joburg tonight. The winner instantly becomes a millionaire
and wins prizes such as a Ford Fiesta Eco-boost, Truworths voucher, Telkom One
million cash and a recording deal from Gallo Recording Company The top two contestants performed with
the Mzansi Gay Choir. Sneziey's performed ‘Burn Out’ by Sipho
Hotstix Mabuse and Luyolo, who came out of his shell, took the crowd away with ‘Green
Light’ by John Legend. Somizi said: "Whoever wins tonight
must take this opportunity and run with it. They must sing music that from
their heart and not what the composers give them. Both of them are winners and
the only difference is that the other one is winning money." Unathi said: "It’s been a true
honour to sit here in the season fifteen of Idols. I believe both of you have
won already. The moment you announced the winner that is when you start running
in the game." Randall said: "Both of you have
very successful careers ahead of you. You have made a special year for the
three of us and everyone working in this production." It has been over two months since the
show started and the pressure has been high. The show has been trending for good and
bad reasons and there was a bit of controversy when the twins exited the show
and the most recent one about Unathi’s tribalism comments. The opening performance was by former
contestants who performed ‘Preach’ by award-winning American singer John
Legend. The wooden mic winner was Beatrice, who sang ‘Waka Waka’ by Shakira Artists such as DJ Zinhle, Season
