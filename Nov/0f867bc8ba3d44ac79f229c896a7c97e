FAMILY and friends were joined by hundreds of mourners who flocked to the Joburg City Hall yesterday. They were paying tribute to late social development MEC Thuliswa Nkabinde-Khawe. She died at Mulbarton Hospital in Joburg, Gauteng, on Friday after a short illness. Nkabinde-Khawe had been an MPL since 2009 and was also Sanco secretary in Gauteng. She was described as a committed activist who mobilised communities in the province. Deputy ANC chief whip in Gauteng, Thoko Magagula, said: “She was committed and passionate about the work she was doing underground to improve the lives of poor black people in Gauteng.” Magagula praised the late MEC for being at the forefront in the fight against gender-based violence. “The government has lost a reliable servant and loyal member of the public who always strived to deliver services to the most vulnerable,” she said. Family spokeswoman Busi Nkabinde said: “Her presence made a huge difference to us. We hope to gain strength going forward.” Nkabinde-Khawe is survived by her six kids and husband. Her daughter Tshepo Nkabinde (21) described her mother as someone who placed the needs of others before her own. Tshepo said her mother took care of the people of the country and those of her family. “My mother was the servant of the people,” she told the People’s Paper. Political parties paid tribute to the MEC at a special Legislature sitting on Tuesday. Nkabinde-Khawe will be buried at the Meyerton Cemetery on tomorrow.
