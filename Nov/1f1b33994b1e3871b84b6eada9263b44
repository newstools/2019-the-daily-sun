MARITZBURG United coach Eric Tinkler has shrugged off his side’s disappointing 2-0 Absa Premiership home loss to SuperSport United on Wednesday. But he stressed his players will roll up their sleeves and he will make changes when they meet AmaZulu in a Kwa-Zulu Natal league derby at King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm). The Team of Choice were suffering from burnout after their heroics in beating Kaizer Chiefs 2-0 in the Telkom Knockout semi-final last weekend to set up a final date against Mamelodi Sundowns in Durban on 14 December. Tinkler said it was expected that his team will not play brilliantly twice in the space of three days. He added it was impossible his team was going to show the same performance they displayed against Chiefs. Tinkler’s charges were brought back down to earth against SuperSport. This loss ended United’s eight game unbeaten run. The exertion of beating Chiefs was evident and Maritzburg could not replicate their cup form. Star of their TKO triumph, striker Judas Moseamedi had a quiet game against SuperSport. The former Orlando Pirates coach only made one change - an enforced one to the side that defeated Amakhosi so convincingly, replacing suspended Keagan Buchanan with Bandile Shandu. Said Tinkler: “Getting the guys in the right frame of mind was very, very difficult (against SuperSport). We simply didn’t play with the right intensity we needed to. “We have to take this defeat on the chin. But we now have got to roll up our sleeves (against AmaZulu).” Tinkler promised that he’ll refresh his team against Usuthu who are desperate for points after losing 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday in Pretoria. The Midlands-based side will be without Siyanda Xulu and Phumlani Ntshangase, but Keagan Buchanan returns from suspension.
