The 34-year-old woman believes the investigating officer forced her to withdraw the case after taking a bribe. On Monday, Daily Sun visited the woman from G section Umlazi, KZN. She said her boss at an engineering firm in Mobeni, Durban took her to a park in 2012 and forced her to suck his 4-5. She said in 2017 she couldn’t live with the trauma anymore and opened a case and resigned because the man demanded that she suck his 4-5 again. She claimed the investigating officer called her last year and advised her to drop the case. He apparently told her the employer had two lawyers and she didn’t stand a chance against him. She said in September last year the investigating officer came with three female officers and told her the prosecutor said the state will not prosecute. She was handed a letter to sign but she refused. READ: IDOLS TWINS FREED!
