SHACK fires in Gauteng have over the years left scores of people homeless. In an effort to reduce fires, government has distributed smoke detectors all over Alexandra, Joburg. Over 1 000 smoke detector kits were recently handed out to residents ekasi. Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile said: “These will warn them when there’s smoke and help save lives, as well as the shacks they live in.” Maile said government was trying to ensure squatter camps residents got help in the event of a fire. “We’d like to plead with you to not sell the detectors as they’re going to prevent accidents that can cost you your homes.” Resident Nonhlanhla Munyu (32) said she was happy government was implementing safety measures. Ntsako Sithole (43) said: “We’ve lost valuable items in the past due to fires and hope these detectors will help reduce damage.” Joburg emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said shack fires were often started by negligent people.  His department was on a mission to help avoid such fires. “We’re conducting educational programmes on the dangers of fire and introducing residents to variousenergy sources ones that are unlikely to cause fires,” said Mulaudzi. Earlier this year, about 1 000 households across Joburg received the Jozi Safety Kit. The kits each have a para-safe stove, which puts itself out if it shakes too much, a smoke detector, a burn kit, a lantern light and a 25-litre bucket. Last December, over 800 people were left homeless when a fire destroyed about 500 shacks in Greenville squatter camp in Alex.  In March, over 300 people were left homeless following a fire in Stjwetla.
