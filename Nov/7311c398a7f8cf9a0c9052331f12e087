RESIDENTS are relieved after two thieves who caused power cuts in their area were bust. The men were driving a white BMW when they were spotted by a resident of Paballelo, Upington, and cops were alerted. While some people said they would have preferred the copper thieves be given a serious dose of people’s justice, but they’re happy the men are in jail. Piet Rudolf (37) said they had recently experienced electricity cuts. “I was angry. I was beginning to think Eskom wasn’t taking us seriously,” he said. “But I was pleased the fault was not with the power supplier, but the two thugs. “I wish the person who called the cops would have alerted the residents first. Those two would have gone to hospital before going to the cells.” Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba told Daily Sun the two were bust on Thursday after a tip-off. “Paballelo and Upington Border police members followed up on information about two suspicious men driving a white BMW sedan.” She said the cops stopped the car in Paballelo and found copper cable in the boot. The cable weighed 56kg with a street value of about R8 500. The suspects, aged between 37 and 51, will appear in court soon.
