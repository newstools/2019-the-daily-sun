THERE are big holes in the ground everywhere you look. Residents of Marikana squatter camp near Everest in Springs, Ekurhuleni, say zama zamas dig holes everywhere in search of gold. They told Daily Sun they feared being swallowed alive by the ground as the illegal miners were digging close to their shacks. Worried Samuel Sithole said: “They dig, taking the soil in trucks, saying they’re going to look for gold. We live near dongas that fill with water when it rains”. Another concerned resident said: “This is risky for our kids. They could drown as they play near these man-made dams.” The SunTeam visited Marikana and saw the holes, some of which were filled with water. Residents told the SunTeamthey had been trying to tell the zama zamas to stop, but they had said they had to feed their children. “They tell us to give them jobs or leave them alone,” said Petrus Sibeko.“These people dictate to us yet they mine illegally.” Resident Sibonelo Malatjie said they dug anywhere they thought they might find gold. “Our lives are at risk,” said Sibonelo. Another resident said it was difficult to fight the problem because illegal miners lived in the squatter camp. “Some people are renting out accommodation to them and even when people complain, others protect them because they benefit from the rent,” said the resident. Captain Johannes Ramphora of the Springs police said cops had on several occasions confiscated the equipment used by illegal miners. “We often pounce on the illegal miners when they least expect it.” Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said illegal mining was a police matter.
