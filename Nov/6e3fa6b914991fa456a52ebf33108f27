THE appointment of Andre de Ruyter as Eskom CEO has received mixed reactions from political parties and unions. The Department of Public Enterprises announced on Monday night that De Ruyter will run the power utility from 15 January next year. He’ll replace Phakamani Hadebe, who left the power utility in July. The EFF labelled the appointment as anti-transformation and racist, alleging that it was part of a racist project led by Minister Pravin Gordhan to undermine Africans. “The appointment of Ruyter is irrational, shameful, a clear demonstration of deliberate intent to collapse Eskom to rationalise privatisation of South Africa’s most important strategic assets at the hands of people, and doesn’t come as a surprise. “His appointment is part of a racist project led by Pravin Gordhan to undermine Africans. Since his appointment as minister of public enterprises, Pravin has been removing African managers at SOEs in favour of non-African males, some even less qualified or less experienced compared to the removed African managers,” EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said in a voice note. NUM spokesman Livhuwani Mmamburuu told Daily Sun the appointment of Ruyter was a reversal of the transformation gains made since 1994. He said: “His credentials are questionable. He has destroyed Nampak and, as such, he will not receive our support.” Other parties – the ANC, DA, IFP and Cope – welcomed the appointment. Spokesman Pule Mabe said: “The ANC is confident the appointment of the new CEO will strengthen its capacity to deliver reliable energy to South Africans.”
