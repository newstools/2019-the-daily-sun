A major drug bust led to the arrest of two suspects today. Speaking to Daily Sun Provincial spokesman Vishnu Naiidoo explained that this bust was linked to two houses that were raided three months ago in Diepkloof and Middleburg. “The house in freestate is the main supplier of the four houses linked to this family. There, we discovered drugs and equipment estimated to be not under R100million, said Naidoo.

His boss drove off in a Toyota Fortuner when he saw the police driving up the hill of his house. Unfortunately for him the police gave chase until they arrested him,” said Naidoo.  SAPS National Commissioner Khehla Sitole said this is an operation targeting criminal kingpins involved in major drug syndicates. “This is an ongoing investigation that will help clear the communities off drug lords towards a safer festive season. "We still have more addresses that link to this family name. In the houses that we bust, we found lots of money and minimal equipment showing that these are mostly used for storage and distribution,” he said.
