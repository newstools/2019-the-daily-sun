PATRICIA Matsi (51) wants her “miracle” to be delivered, failing which she wants her money back – nothing more, nothing less. She said she’s tired of running after the pastor, begging him to return her money after the pastor sold her fake “miracle” for R2 000.  The 51-year-old from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she went to a church in Rustenburg to sort out her personal problems. At first a prophet helped her, and she decided to stay before returning to Tembisa. But later a pastor told her things about herself he couldn’t have known about. “I believed him because I was already receiving help from the same church,” said Patricia.

Patricia was excited and waited a few more days for her miracle. “I thought all my problems would go and I’d finally be happy,” she said. But three days passed and there was no miracle. “I gave him two more days as I thought he might be busy,” she said. “But a week passed and he said nothing. “When I asked what was going on, he said I was being impatient. “I waited three more days and still nothing happened.” Patricia said she’s sick and tired of waiting. “He must send a miracle or give me my money back,” she said.

Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said Patricia needed to open a case. “Before you pay any money, you need to ask questions,” said Peters. “Do your research and call the church for validation. “You need to report such cases immediately and make sure you bring proof of payment with you.”
