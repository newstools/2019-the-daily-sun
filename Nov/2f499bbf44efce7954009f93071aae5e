The bail hearing of the man accused of killing his girlfriend has been postponed again. Kevin Ndlovu appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Tuesday. READ: TWINS DUMP HUSBAND! He’s from Agincourt Village, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga. The 21-year-old was bust in June after confessing to his mum that he killed Nokulunga Mbatha (22) from KZN. Nokulunga’s body was stashed in a suitcase and found buried in a shallow grave in Ndlovu’s mum’s backyard. Magistrate Fortune Mhlaba postponed the case to 5 December so police could investigate and conduct DNA tests. Mbatha’s decomposed body hasn’t been matched with any of the relatives who came forward. Prosecutor Musa Makhubele pleaded with the court to give cops a chance to finalise the DNA testing process. During Ndlovu’s previous appearances, the court heard that his Legal Aid lawyer Eric Mashele intended to drop his bail application. Ndlovu remains behind bars.
