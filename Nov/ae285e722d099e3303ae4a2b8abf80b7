THE people of Imizamo Yethu are sick and tired of being failed by the police. Residents of the kasi in Hout Bay, Cape Town, told the SunTeam their cop shop was just like a clinic as it was closed by sunset. About 200 people gathered at the local sports ground near the police station on Saturday. They sang and danced before handing over a memorandum of demands to the cops. Community leader Nomaxabiso Mdange said: “We want the station commander to be removed. “We also want two investigating officers to be removed because they’re working against us. “People who commit crimes appear in court and their cases are thrown out, despite the overwhelming evidence residents give the cops.” Zukiswa Qezo of the Social Justice Coalition said the cop shop needed to be open 24 hours a day. “Residents have lost faith in the cops. They now patrol the streets and often catch the thugs themselves. “The cops aren’t happy about this and we’re saying hands off our patrollers,” said Zukiswa. Another community leader, Bridgette Hangcu, said the patrollers were being victimised by cops. “When they catch a thug and hand him over to the cops, the patrollers are arrested on trumped-up charges,” she said. Acting cluster commander Brigadier Fred Alexander accepted the memorandum and promised to deal with the matter. “I’ll come back to the community and update them on steps we’ll be taking to address the matter,” he said.
