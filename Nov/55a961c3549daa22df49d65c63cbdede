It's been seventeen years since pop superstar Celine Dion scored a number one album. Now her latest offering Courage, which was released on November 15 has debuted at number one on the Billboard Charts. In its first week of release, the album sold 113 000 units, according to Nielsen Music. Courage marks Dion’s fifth No. 1 album, and her first chart-topper in over 17 years. She was last at No. 1 with 2002’s A New Day Has Come. The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The new Nov. 30-dated chart, where Courage bows at No. 1, will be posted in full on Billboard's websites on Nov. 26.
