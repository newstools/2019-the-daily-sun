So on Saturday in rainy Johannesburg, a drunk driver (4x the legal limit at least according to the test) decided that he like mine (5 days old) and the Metro police officers’ (2 days old) cars so much that he wants to crash into us. Lucky for everyone involved, no one got hurt. My poor little red riding hood got the shock of her life when we heard a sudden screech and BANG! Lucky my #SwedishLuxury activated and all the safety features the @volvocarsa is fitted with came into effect and prevented me from skidding on the wet surface and rolling into crossing traffic. My little red riding hood is gone now but I’m still #V40BringingSexyBack with another sexy little number just in time for my road trip down to Durban! Truly the safest cars in the world! #volvomoments ???? A post shared by  Dr Musa Mthombeni (@drmusamthombeni) on Nov 12, 2019 at 2:08am PST
