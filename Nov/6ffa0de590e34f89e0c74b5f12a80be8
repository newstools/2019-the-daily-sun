GOGO Anna Mokgotho loves her bicycle, which she has had for years. It takes her from point A to B without having spent a cent.  The 52-year-old gogo from Ga-Rametloana in Moletjie, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, is a farmer. Anna uses the bicycle to travel to her farm every day. Gogo said: “This bicycle is like a car to me, and I’m able to provide for my family.” She enjoyed riding her late husband’s bicycle so much she bought one for herself.     “It was in 2010 when I decided to buy a bicycle from the little I had budgeted, but it was not my family’s wish,” she said. “At first people used to look at me and laugh, but deep down inside I knew what my intention was. “Today I catch everyone’s attention through my riding skills and the experience I have.” Gogo said she rides a lot!

She said she rides her bicycle even in her spare time as it keeps her young and healthy. “This also keeps me fit and fights away chronic diseases some elders experience.” She said because of the high cost of living, her bicycle helps her save a lot of money she would otherwise spend on transport.
