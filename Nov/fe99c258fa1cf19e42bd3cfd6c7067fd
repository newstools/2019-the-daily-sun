ILLEGAL dumping and an overflowing drain make life difficult for Elizabeth Andrews. The 51-year-old from Melkbos Street in Arcadia, Port Elizabeth, wants the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality to rescue her from the stinking environment. She said she suffers from asthma and a thyroid disease. The SunTeam saw her on Monday morning while she was busy picking up rubbish. “The rubbish gets collected every week. “People from other streets dump rubbish next to my house. “When I complain they insult me. On windy and hot days the stench is unbearable. “People dump all sorts of things here. “It becomes worse when they burn their rubbish because smoke comes into my house. I can’t stand this anymore.” Mayoral spokesman George Geleba said: “The municipality appeals to residents to help fight waste by reporting illegal dumping. “Service delivery issues can be reported to our operational line on 0800 205 050.”
