RESIDENTS of Ga-Ramotshinyadi Village outside Tzaneen, Limpopo, said their crumbling clinic needed urgent attention. Residents want the clinic to be upgraded to deal with the increasing demand for healthcare services in the area. “All we have is an old, embarrassing building with a dilapidated roof, cracked walls and leaking roof and toilet,” said a resident. Another resident, Phuti Phalane, said they had complained about the problem but this fell on deaf ears. According to Sanco committee member Bruce Ramoshaba, the clinic was built in 1985 by local businessman Makoti Pilusa, who died in 1993. Patient Johannes Malatjie (92) said: “The department took over the clinic as well as other community clinics in the area. But our clinic remains neglected since. Ntate Pilusa must be turning in his grave seeing how bad the clinic is.” Limpopo health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said: “We don’t want to make empty promises. “We’re aware of the situation at the clinic, but there’s no budget to build a new one. We can only make plans to refurbish, which something we’ve been doing with other local clinics.” He said Ga-Ramotshinyadi wasn’t the only area with a clinic problem.
