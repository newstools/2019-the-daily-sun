UNDER-fire Baroka head coach Wedson Nyirenda is a relieved man! The Ga-Mphahlele based club came into this clash without a win in five consecutive Absa Premiership games, losing four and drawing one. But Baroka finally registered a much needed victory after beating Polokwane City 1-0 in a Limpopo derby on Saturday night at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. Reports were that the Zambian born mentor could have been sacked if Baroka had lost to City. Said Nyirenda: “This is good result for us, but I don’t think we played our normal game. But what is most important is the result. I think we struggled due to fatigue. “But I am happy with a win as it gives us something to smile about going into the international break. This win gives us a breather.” This was also a first win for Nyirenda against Rise and Shine since he took over last season at Baroka. Nyirenda has also warned his players not to rest on their laurels. “We need to stay focused and continue working hard,”said the former Kaizer Chiefs striker. “There is still lot of work to be done. We have collected four points in two games which is not bad. I think now we need to build on this run and move up on the log.” Nyirenda was also impressed by his goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze. “Chipezeze was excellent. It is good to have an international goalkeeper like Chipezeze. We were exposed two or three times but he was there to save us.” Baroka have now collected 12 points from 11 games. However, Bakgaga are still at the wrong end of the table, only five points separates them from bottom side Chippa United. Baroka face struggling Orlando Pirates in their next league match at Orlando Stadium on 26 November.
