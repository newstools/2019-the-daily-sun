When you miss your car instalments, the bank will come and take it away. Firstly they would ask you to surrender it peacefully but if you refuse, they will trace you and take it by force. A video has emerged showing officials from Mercedes Benz finance repossessing a Mercedes Benz C63Â AMG from a Limpopo man. It appears he was unable to keep up with the installments and never bothered to surrender the car when he was called to do so. Now a video has emerged on social media showing the man arguing and fighting with the guys who came to collect the C63. Upon realising that he is losing the battle, he then empties a bucket of water into the car through the sunroof to try and damage it.
