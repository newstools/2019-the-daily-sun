HOME Affairs has been working hard to deal with long queues. Deputy Minister Njabulo Nzuza and acting department director general Thulani Mavuso said surprise visits were made to offices to keep workers on their toes.

He said officials needed overtime pay to work more hours to serve more people. “Minister Aaron Motsoaledi directed the department to conduct an assessment to develop intervention strategies to deal with the challenges of long queues.” He said initiatives were put into action, including separate counters for those using eHomeAffairs and issuing tickets to customers not served on a particular day, to ensure they were helped first the next day. Asked about services to refugees, Mavuso said they had to employ interpreters to help people from different countries. READ: BOSS FORCED ME TO SUCK HIS 4-5! This didn’t sit well with Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota, who said Mzansi shouldn’t be paying the costs. “People come from their countries to South Africa and we have to use lots of money for interpreting services. Something must be done. You must present this to the cabinet. If they don’t do something, then I give up on this country,” Lekota said.
