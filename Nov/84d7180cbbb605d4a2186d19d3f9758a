THE fiancee of the KZN Legislature member, Vikizitha Mlotshwa from the National Freedom Party (NFP) who died in a blaze was buried today. The fiance Amelta Dlamini (39) died after setting their house on fire while she was with her son Sheleni (4) in Winterton last Thursday.  She killed herself because she was troubled by her daughter, who is Mlotshwa's step daughter Busiswa Dlamini (15). And the daughter Busiswa who drank brake fluid and died on Friday after hearing of what her mom did will be buried tomorrow. Amelta's funeral which was attended by the KZN legislature member, National Freedom Party (NFP), Democratic Alliance (DA) and African National Congress (ANC) members and leaders was held at Amelta's home in Khetheni, Winterton.  Speaking at the funeral Amelta's brother Bongani Dlamini (36) said as family they are hurt about the death of his sister. She was a loving and kind person. "It will be very hard to live without her. But I will not speak much about what led to her death as we all know. I hope she rests in peace, he said. And Amelta's aunt Sithembi Dlamini said a week before the incident happened Amelta came to her and they spoke about the troubles she was going through. She said on that day she couldnt even eat because of the pain she felt in her heart. "But I didnt think that she will end up doing something like this. I will really miss her," she said. The KZN Legislature speaker Nontembeko Boyce said:"We are saddened by Amelta's death because we understand the critical role played by women leaders especially those who stay at home and continue to mobilise community and ensure that services reach the residents." She said but most of all they pray for speedy recovery of the son, Sheleni who is still in hospital. "We hope that the boy recovers so that Mlotshwa does not loose three familiy members," she said. The son Sheleni is in a stable condition at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban.
