The City of Johannesburg has welcomed more than 1000 newly trained JMPD officers. Joburg currently has the largest recruitment of metro police cops in the country.  The event took place at the Nasrec Expo Centre and was filled with ululations from friends and families who came to support the graduates during the pass out parade. JMPD used the opportunity to show off their newly acquired fleet to entertain the spectators. The parade was headed by the outgoing mayor of Joburg, Herman Mashaba. Mashaba said the newly trained officers would help curb the rate of crime in the city. "We have always understood that to win against crime we need to provide proper attention to the JMPD," he said. He further said the JMPD academy was working tirelessly to reduce the rate of unemployment in Mzansi. “Like many public entities or government agencies, the JMPD has had to confront the harsh realities that come with our unusually high unemployment rate,” he added. More than 60 000 applications were received for 1 579 trainee positions. Michael Sun, MMC for the Department of Public Safety encouraged the graduates to serve the public with pride and dignity. “You endured intensive training and made it through, for that we commend you for taking an oath to protect the public,” he said.
