VIKELA Dladla wants justice. The 28-year-old from KwaPata in Pietermaritzburg told Daily Sun he narrowly escaped death in the early hours of Sunday. Vikela said a cop set a dog on him. He said he and five others were driving home from a club when a dog unit patrol car stopped them. “He asked for my licence and searched my car. When he was done, he let me go but followed me,” he said. Vikela said he dropped off his friends in Imbali.  “The cop stopped me again and asked me to get out of the car. I did as he asked. “That’s when he set his dog on me. The dog bit me. I ran for my life. It was so aggressive I thought it would finish me off.” Vikela said he was saved by another police van that arrived out of the blue.  Vikela said he was arrested and spent two days in the cells at Plessislaer cop shop. “I went to court on Tuesday and all the charges against me were withdrawn,” he said.  He was charged with reckless driving, not stopping when instructed to do so, and crashing into a police car. “All those charges were lies because I was driving responsibly,” he said. He said he wanted to open a case against the policeman.  KZN Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a 28-year-old man was arrested for reckless and negligent driving. She said: “If the suspect feels his rights were violated by the police, he is advised to report to the nearest cop shop.”
