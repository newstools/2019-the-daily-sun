THE YOUNG Pharaohs may be one of the fan favourites to win the Olympic Games qualifier matches, but they are certainly quacking in their boots at the thought of meeting South Africa in the semi-finals. The Egyptians are a shaky to meet South Africa in the Africa Cup of Nations currently underway in the north African country.The permutations suggest that Young Bafana could play the tournament hosts. But that can only happen if South Africa finish second in Group B and Egypt win Group A.Currently Egypt are leading Group A with six points and they have automatically qualified for semi-finals, while in Group B anything can still. Young Bafana are leading the group with four points from two outings. A win against Nigeria in the final group match Thursday will see them proceed to the semis.But coach David Notoane is already rubbing his hands with glee, relishing the prospect of meeting Mzansi’s old football enemy. Notoane says he would prefer to meet them in the final of the tournament, set for Cairo on 22 November.It could be a crowd-puller, considering the recent senior Africa Cup of Nations humiliating quarter-final exit Egypt suffered at the hands of Bafana. “I would prefer, if everything goes well, we meet Egypt in the final,” said Notoane. “I think it will be a good spectacle, good atmosphere but if we meet them in the semi-final, it is a competition then we have to do what we have do. “Maybe we are on track, we have one more game left…” South Africa have a fairly good history against the Egyptians. The SA Under-17 team, Amajimbos, got the better of the Pharaohs in 2014 during the Youth Championships qualifiers. Amajita (SA U-20s) have also done the job beating Egypt 1-0 in the Cosafa Cup Championships in Zambia. Now having got the cream of crop in his team, Notoane is ready for the hosts, but he must qualify for the next round first. The top three teams in this tournament will qualify and present Africa at the Olympics next year.
