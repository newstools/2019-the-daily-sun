THE kasi is known as the country’s murder capital and they want to change that. Residents are trying everything to change this.  Recently the community, in partnership with Triangle Project, cops and other stakeholders, met to discuss problems affecting the kasi. Triangle Project organiser Pharie Sefali (31) said the indaba was held to encourage people to come forward and tell stories about being abused. “They must speak out. Keeping quiet is not an option. Women and children are being killed every day. “Men who know they have problems must seek help and admit they’re having issues.” Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi said: “Kids must play in safe places and in groups and mustn’t ask strangers for money.

If you’re too lazy just forget about it.” Mothers were told to create a strong relationship with their kids, so it becomes easier for their daughters to report being abused. Street committee representative Sandile Nomjila said children could report to them if they had problems with their parents. “We’re here for them,” he said. Sandile said people couldn’t expect cops to do everything. “We must work with them to change how people see Nyanga,” he said. Nqaba Madlavu (49) said the only people who’ll end violence against women and children are men. “How will they hear the cries when they don’t attend these events,” he asked. Zikhona Mtsi (36) said: “We’re not safe in our own homes. It seems things we do to end gender-based violence have not worked, but we won’t stop.”
