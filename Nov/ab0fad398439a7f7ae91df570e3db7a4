CIVIL Rights Organisation AfriForum has laid criminal
charges of incitement to violence against the EFF Secretary General Godrich
Gardee at the Lyttelton police station in Tshwane. The organisation filed charges under Section 18 of the
Riotous Assemblies Act, 17 of 1956. AfriForum also lodged a complaint of hate speech with the
South African Human Rights Commission against Gardee. Afriforum Campaign Officer, Ernst van Zyl, said the charges
came after Gardee’s recent tweet stating that the Loftus Versfeld stadium where
Evangelist Pastor Angus Buchan had organised an event should be “booby-trapped”
with limpet mines prior to the event. Buchan specifically called for Afrikaners to attend this
event. Van Zyl said the disturbing tweet by the Secretary General
of the EFF seems to indicate that the party believes it can incite violence
against South African citizens without having to face any consequences. “Violent threats of this nature have no place in any
society, especially not from the Secretary General of the third-largest
political party in South Africa,” she said. According to her, AfriForum views Gardee’s threatening tweet
as very dangerous and malicious. “The civil rights organisation therefore took steps to
ensure justice through proper legal channels. “We urge the authorities to take proper action against
Gardee to ensure accountability and also to serve as a deterrent for those who
want to make violent threats of this nature in the future,” she said. Gardee’s tweet came after EFF deputy president Floyd
Shivambu posted a video clip on Twitter of Buchan convening a prayer meeting
called "Staan op vir Jesus" (stand up for Jesus).
