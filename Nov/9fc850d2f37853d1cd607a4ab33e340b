THOUSANDS upon thousands of proud Mzansi citizens turned the OR Tambo International Airport green and gold to welcome home our Rugby World champions. Young and old all of races filled the airport the entire day and evening waiting for the heroes to land from Japan. True to Mzansi style, music and dance entertained the crowds as they waited . A pouncing cat and vosho caught the eyes of the SunTeam as dancing circles opened and  amapiano to pop music blasted throughout the crowds. Some were really good on the dance floor, while some were dancing like they have two left feet, however the mood was electric. Rumbling sounds echoed across the International Arrivals terminal as the first group of the Springboks arrived. Makazole Mapimpi who scored the first try against England, his name was chanted as he walked through the crowds. Vincent Kock was delighted by the reception at the airport. That probably prompted to be generous with the High Fives as he was dishing them left, right and center. In the midst of all the happiness and excitement, there was also a pinch of chaos as police clashed  with photographers who all wanted clear shots of the players.
