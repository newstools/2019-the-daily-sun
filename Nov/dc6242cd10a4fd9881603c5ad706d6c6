GLADAFRICA Championship strugglers Royal Eagles have to find a way to break their slump. Soon. This is according to their assistant coach, Mncedi Sibiya, who has admitted their poor form is a huge cause for concern. They have lost six, drew four and won just one of their 11 matches so far in the league. This has left them languishing at the bottom of the Championship standings and are the early favourites to get the dreaded axe. Said Sibiya: “Things have to change. There’s no question about it. “We’re in a very bad situation at the moment and can’t afford to let it get any worse. As a club, we’re all working hard to turn our fortunes around. “We need to start winning games and that needs to happen now.” In an attempt to stave off relegation to the third tier of Mzansi football, the Pietermaritzburg side turned to Momcilo “Moma” Medic to save them. The former Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila mentor, who has been handed the reins earlier this month on a two-year deal, will have to find his feet quickly if he’s to pull off the great escape from this dark hole. Sibiya is confident the Serbian tactician can steer the team to calm waters once he settles into his new job. “We’re working extremely hard and believe we can get out of this situation,” added Sibiya. “We need to stick together and continue fighting until the very end. “The good thing is that we still have a lot of time to turn things around.” Eagles will be hoping to kick-start their revival with victory over rookies Steenberg in today’s only Championship match at Athlone Stadium (3.30pm).
