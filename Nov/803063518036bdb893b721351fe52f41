BENNI McCarthy for Bafana Bafana? “No. I don’t know what his next move is. We’ll have to wait and see,” said Safa president Danny Jordaan, when quizzed on McCarthy’s possible return to Bafana, though in a different capacity other than a head coach. “He’s a South Africa. He is a coach in this country. That is why I say it’s not the end of his career, but the beginning.” McCarthy is unemployed after he was fired as Cape Town City coach on MondayAnd no sooner was the former Bafana striker dismissed than he was linked with a return to Orlando Pirates or Bafana. But Jordaan has refused to be drawn on whether or not he could be roped in at Safa. “I can’t speculate. If we have anything to say, we will tell you. For now, we don’t have anything to say,” added Jordaan. “These things do happen in football. Unfortunately you’ll see we have hardly reached 10 matches in the league and so many coaches are gone. “Obviously, he’s done well over the last three years, and I think all of you have said so. He is young as a coach. And clearly it is not the end of his career. He is only at the beginning. “There are too many ifs in your question. Let us sort out the ‘ifs’ first and then I can give you an answer. I can’t go on the route and speculate.” McCarthy won his first major trophy as a coach when he guided City to the MTN8 Cup championship last season. It is unclear whether McCarthy will be considering offers locally or will be heading overseas.
