CHABALALA may be facing the law, but it hasn’t stopped him
from tying the knot! Trucking boss Sam Chabalala (23), who goes by his clan name
of Mshengu, married long-time sweetheart Lerato Legodi (28) at Zimbali Resort
in KZN on Saturday. It seems they didn’t want others to know about the big day.
But two photos of them dancing were leaked on Instagram. One of those who attended the wedding said there were fewer
than 200 guests. Apparently, the two had a customary ceremony late last year.  On 7 July Lerato said on Instagram she couldn’t wait for
their big day. She posted a picture of Mshengu in a suit. “Yum yum, can’t wait
for the wedding day! I mean, damn babe!” she wrote. He is out on R200 000 bail after being bust in September at
Witbank Mall. He faces charges of fraud, corruption, contravention of the
Immigration Act and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Lerato has been attending his court case, supported by her
family and his friends.  Chabalala attracted attention by flashing 72 expensive cars
in a convoy going to the Durban July. He claimed to be born in Venda. But when Home Affairs
quizzed him, he said he was born in Bethal Hospital. But there was no record of
it. When Daily Sun called his attorney, Namedi Phatudi, he said
he didn’t know he was getting married. Chabalala is expected in the Witbank Magistrates Court on
Friday.
