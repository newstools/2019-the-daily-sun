MSINGA in the KZN Midlands has seen an increase in the number of rapes and murders of women and children. Arts, Culture, Sports and Recreation MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela revealed this on Monday during the launch of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children. She said the latest statistics showed more women and children were being raped and killed in the area.

We need to be residents who live in harmony.” Mavimbela said: “We’re going to continue with this programme, visiting different parts of Msinga. These campaigns should be for the entire 365 days.” Nozibusiso Zikhali from Mbazwana said she chose to be part of the march as she was worried about the way men treated women. “Many see us as sex objects. We’re here to say the killing and abuse of women and children must come to an end.” She said so many women had been killed, including Mangosuthu University of Technology student Zolile Khumalo (21), allegedly killed by ex-boyfriend Thabani Mzolo, about two years ago.  Sbonelo Mbuyazi, one of the men who took part in the march, said everyone needed to get involved so they could show how serious the problem was. “As men we need to start taking responsibility for the safety of our women in the society. “They’re our mothers and sisters. It’s our duty to make sure they’re safe, and that we don’t abuse them.”
