THREE suspects are expected to appear in the Vryheid Magistrates Court today. The men, aged between 23 and 30, were bust on Sunday after seven cows and calves were found in their trailer. Brigadier Jay Naicker said cops found the carcasses of four cows in their bakkie. They were bust when they could not explain how they came into possession of the livestock. READ: THE TERROR OF A CAT TAXI DRIVER! “The suspects were held at Vryheid Police Station and charged with stock theft and possession of suspected stolen property.” “Further investigations linked them to other stock theft cases in Vryheid and Paulpietersburg.” In another operation by the Pietermaritzburg stock theft unit in Plessislaer on Sunday, a man was bust and four cows seized in KwaPata. Naicker said two of the cows were branded and were handed back to their lawful owner. The suspect would appear in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court soon. A livestock owner (54) said: “Maybe this will decrease the high stock theft rates in KZN.”  Meanwhile, provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula praised the police for the arrests. “Due to heightened visibility on major routes since the launch of festive operations, we have bust a large number of criminals transporting stolen stock and carcasses.” The commissioner appealed to livestock owners to brand their stock.
