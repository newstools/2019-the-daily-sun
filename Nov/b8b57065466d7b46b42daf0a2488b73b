ACCORDING to figures recorded by state mortuaries in Gauteng, gunshot wounds, accidents and stabbings are the top three ways people die. These are the deaths that were recorded in state mortuaries between 2018 and 2019. This breakdown was released by the Gauteng Health Department. READ: I CAN’T BATH IN FRONT OF MY SON! The department revealed that 2 416 people died from gunshots, 1 695 from accident crashes, while 1 295 people died from stab wounds. “These figures are recorded by state mortuaries. “They reflect deaths at the scene or people who survived the initial trauma, but later died of complications at home or at healthcare facilities,” said the department. Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said the rate of unnatural deaths as a result of violence was a cause for serious concern for the country. “Accident and emergency departments in our hospitals are the busiest around month end period, with a notably high number of gunshot wounds, stabbings and motor vehicle accident patients coming in. One of the contributing factors is the high level of alcohol consumption, which leads to violence and reckless driving,” he said. READ: WAR OVER IDOLS TWINS! Over a week ago, Parliament announced that the Portfolio Committee on Police has approved an application from the Ministry of Police for a firearm amnesty to reduce guns on the streets. The amnesty will be effective from next month. Gun Free SA welcomed the announcement. The organisation’s researcher, Claire Taylor, said: “The chance of being shot is not random. “For someone to be shot, there must be a gun. When guns are controlled and less available, fewer shootings happen and lives are saved.”
