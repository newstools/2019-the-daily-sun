DR LINDANI Sithole left for work last Wednesday as usual. But that was the last time his family saw him. Lindani’s aunt, Nolwazi, said the family later discovered he never arrived at work. His car was found abandoned in Utrecht. The family suspects he was kidnapped. “His lunch box was found inside his abandoned car,” Nolwazi said. Cops are appealing to SunReaders to help find the 27-year-old from Dannhauser, KZN. Nolwazi said on the day he disappeared, Lindani was supposed to collect his mum after work, but he never arrived. “We became worried when he didn’t arrive home at 9pm as expected. When his mum called him, there was no answer and his WhatsApp was last active in the morning,” she said. Nolwazi said Lindani’s mum called the hospital where he worked to find out if he had reported for duty. “His mum later got a call from the hospital informing her his car had been found abandoned.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a missing persons docket had been opened. “We appeal to anyone with information to contact Colonel Kubheka on 082 373 8693 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111,” she said.
