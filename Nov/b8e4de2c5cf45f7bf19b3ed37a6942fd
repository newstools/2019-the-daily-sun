SOUTH African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has confirmed Bafana Bafana's Sunday 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier between South Africa and Sudan will be televised. On Thursday footbal fanatics were left with a egg on their face as they could not watch Bafana Bafana Afcon qualifier match against Ghana as neither SuperSport nor the SABC showed the match. Bafana lost that encounter 2-0 which was coach Molefi Ntseki's first official match in charge of the national team. Thomas Partey and Kudus Mohammed netted a goal each as Ghana secured maximum points at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium. Coach Ntseki will be hoping to bounce back when South Africa face Sudan on Sunday at Orlando Stadium, 3pm
