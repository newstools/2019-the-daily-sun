 MZANSI peoples have a period of six months to return their
illegal guns to the police with no effects! This was announced by the South African Police Minister,
Bheki Cele, on Thursday when he was briefing the media in Tshwane. He said they have a six months space of firearm amnesty
starting from the 1st of December to end of May 2020 after that period there
won’t be any mercy. He said their interest with the guns was more focused on the
illegal firearms, but they have been receiving negative response from the
people, saying they won’t get those guns. “The reason people think we won’t get those firearms is
because when you return your gun we are going to check to see if your firearm was
not used to commit crimes.” “There is no way we can take your gun and not check its history. “If we do that, we will be opening a can of worms,” he said. Cele said because of that they have been told that they are
discouraging people from returning their guns. “After the six months period we will do everything by all
means to get those guns, if it means we go house to house that is what we will
do. “We have actually began doing that. “In the past two months we have found over 2000 guns mostly
in Gauteng and Kwa-Zulu Natal,” he said. The minister said up to 450,000 firearms that were legally
owned are now unlawful after the licences expired. According to him the notice holders of unlicensed firearms
or ammunition can drop them at any police station in the country, except for 46
of them. He said applicants will have to surrender their weapons or
ammunition to a designated amnesty officer who must provide a receipt. The Minister said those who have firearms with expired
licences can renew their licences or return them, but when you renew they will
also do a check on the gun, in case it can be linked to any crime that was
committed. “Gun owners who have failed to renew their licences will
also be able to reapply for the weapon they have surrendered,” he said
