Following reports from Sunday World that Enhle and DJ Blackcoffee are divorcing, a teary Enhle speaks out. Enhle quoted Chimamanda Ngozi famous quote which reads in part “..I am expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important. Now marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support but why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don’t teach boys the same? We raise girls to see each other as competitors not for jobs or accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men..” .
