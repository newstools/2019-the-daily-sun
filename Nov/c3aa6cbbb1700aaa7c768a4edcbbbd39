THE South African Post Office said it was upgrading security in its branches to ensure that customers feel safe. The organisation’s acting chief financial officer Jabulani Dlamuka told Parliament on Tuesday that Sapo realised security needed to be boosted after the death of University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana. “We were shaken by what happened in Cape Town, where a customer was killed in our branch,” said Dlamuka. “It indicates some lack of security protocol in our branches. We want to ensure our customers feel secure at all times.” Dlamuka told MPs about security challenges Sapo was encountering when distributing Sassa grants. “Looking at our security costs, they have been escalating because of Sassa. We want to take a different approach to security.” Uyinene was raped and killed at a post office in August, where she had gone to collect a parcel. Former post office employee Luyanda Botha (42) was arrested two weeks after Uyinene went missing and has since appeared in court in connection with the murder. He is expected to make his first appearance in the Western Cape High Court after his case was transferred from the Wynberg Magistrates Court last week. Investigations revealed Botha had a criminal record as he had served jail time in the late 90s for a hijacking.
