ERIC Mathoho is confident his Kaizer Chiefs side can end their winless run over Orlando Pirates that has now stretched to a Soweto Derby record of 13 games. Chiefs triumphed over their great rivals only last weekend in the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals, but that was on post-match penalties after a 2-2 draw in Durban. Saturday’s clash at the FNB Stadium is an opportunity for them to get an outright victory over Pirates for the first time since December 2014. “It’s going to be tough and they definitely won’t go easy on us,” Mathoho told his club’s website. “The nature of the Derby is such that even if a team is not doing well, when Chiefs play Pirates everyone lifts their game.“But we are ready for any challenge, especially this season. We must fight the full 90 minutes and we want to get the three points.“Personally, I don’t focus on the stats, I just want to go out there and do well. We might not have been doing well last season, but this season we are much improved, and I can’t wait for the game.”Mathoho says it was always his dream as a younger to play in the Soweto Derby.“When I was young, I always watched Chiefs and Pirates play. I said to myself that one day I will play for Chiefs against Pirates.“Now that I have played and hopefully will play in the Derby this Saturday and many more in the future, I am happy to have realised a life-long dream.“I enjoy the Derby, it’s hard for me to explain, but I love it – the atmosphere and everything. We play many games in a season against good teams but the Derby against Pirates is what I have dreamt about playing.” -SUPERSPORT
