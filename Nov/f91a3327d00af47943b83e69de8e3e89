SHE’S only four years old, but Londeka Mgobhozi has more tittles than her age. Her community has dubbed her the future Miss SA. The little model from Newlands East in Durban has 17 titles under her belt, including Miss Petite KZN, Miss Purple Cover Magazine and Miss Denim.  Her dream is to meet Miss SA Zozibini Tunzi so that she can share her modelling experience with her. Her parents Sandile Gumede and Amanda Mgobhozi already call her “Little Zozibini Tunzi”. Sandile told SunBuzz that from a young age Londeka showed an interest in modelling. “Ever since she was a toddler she loved watching modelling shows on TV. She’d imitate the models on TV. She told us she wanted to become a model,” he said. Sandile said they were not surprised by their little daughter’s achievements.

When Zozibini was crowned Miss SA she was watching. She loves her.” Both parents said they wanted Londeka to take part in competitions outside KZN. “We’re trying to get her to participate in Miss Pink One Springs in Gauteng, Miss All Star SA, as well as Miss Global Beauty. “We have no doubt she’ll win all these titles.”
