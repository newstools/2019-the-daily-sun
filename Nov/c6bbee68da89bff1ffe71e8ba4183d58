A preschool teacherâ€™s video teaching kids how to wipe using balloons has gone viral. The creative teacher in the video is unknown, but it is believed that the school is abroad as wipe lessons are not common in American preschools. Everything about this video is perfection. The tiny chairs, the balloon butts, the methodical wiping, the tissue paper folding technique, the very small kids sitting very still in those tiny chairs.
