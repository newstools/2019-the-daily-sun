Wanting to give your dead loved ones a decent funeral is understandable, but one doesn’t need to spend a fortune to do that. Some people splurge on funerals, forgetting there are still dependants left behind who need to be taken care of. Instead of wasting thousands of rands on death, what about saving for children’s education and living expenses? There’s really no need to overspend. Other people use funerals as a platform to show off. We see this in the coffin or casket used and the flashy attires families wear. We need to stop it. In the past funerals were shorter and families didn’t spend a lot of money on them. The cost of funerals is financially crippling people who’re already under immense pressure. A funeral should be respectful – it’s not a show-off parade. It has become a lot like a soapie to some people and this is not necessary. We can celebrate the dead by spending wisely. There are many ways to make funerals affordable.
