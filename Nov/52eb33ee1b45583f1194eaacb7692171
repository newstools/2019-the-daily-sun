With her song John Cena, Limpopo-born singer Sho Majodzi is making waves. The star recently visited singer Kelly Clarkson's show The Kelly Clarkson Show and while Kelly praised her for penning a song about John Cena, she  joked that he wouldn't be there,  because we "don't have the budget". Kelly then asked Sho Majodzi to perform and while she was performing, John Cena emerged from behind her - much to her pleasant surprise. From Limpopo to Hollywood??
