Social Media gives people a lot of access to a lot of information and this time it is blamed for fueling sex addiction. Sex addict Laurie Jade Woodruff, admitted that social media apps like Instagram fed her lust for no-strings liaisons. Laurie told the British tabloid newspaper, The Sun that  she was 'obsessed' with the thrill of sex with strangers and  Instagram feeds her need for no-strings attached sex. The 30-year-old confessed to having slept with between 100 and 200 people, and at the height of her addiction she had sex with two or three new men a week. “Instagram is a playground full of temptation. At my worst, I was obsessed with the thrill of sleeping with strangers. And social media made it scarily easy to do. Forget going to a bar or bothering with pricey dating apps, Instagram would help me hook up in minutes for free from the comfort of home.” she said. Laurie says she would dress up in provocative clothing and post photos online to attract attention from men. A bad experience was the wake-up call Laurie needed and she went on to join Sex And Love Addicts Anonymous where she got help. She signed up to their 12-step programme the same day and started attending meetings with other addicts.
