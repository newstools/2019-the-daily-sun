COPS are looking for a young man who has been working as a
student doctor but has no qualifications. TimesLive reports that the Mamelodi Hospital discovered that
Richard Phumlani Magudulela used a fake letter bearing the letterhead from UKZN
to gain entry into the hospital. The hospital came under fire this year when a gogo was tied
up onto a steel chair by hospital staff. The site said that for a full month, the man carried a
stethoscope and reported daily for duty at the hospital as a student doctor
from one of Mzansiâ€™s medical schools. Dr Naing Soe, CEO of the hospital, told the paper that
Magudulela started on September 29 and was last seen on October 31 as the
hospital had been doing background checks on him. "As the hospital's CEO I'm appealing to the public to
help the police arrest this man because he must face the law for what he
did," said Soe. The hospital and the provincial department of health have
since launched an investigation into the matter. So far the hospital has not received complaints against the
fake doctor but has warned patients to be on the lookout for him even though he
has been banned from entering the hospital. Mamelodi East police spokesperson Constable Lethabo
Mashiloane confirmed that a case of impersonating a medical doctor has been
opened. She said the police were appealing to the public to assist with any
information regarding Magudulela.
