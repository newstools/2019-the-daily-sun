IT is unclear whether or not Khama Billiat will be fit to feature for Kaizer Chiefs against Stellenbosch on Wednesday. Smarting from the Telkom Knockout semi-final exit, Amakhosi return to league action when they visit Stellies at Cape Town Stadium. But they could do without Billiat, who struggling to shake off a hamstring injury. In fact, the niggling hamstring pain accounted for his absence from the TKO semifinal duel with Maritzburg United on Sunday. And that has ostensibly angered Ernst Middendorp, who couldn’t hide his frustration following shock cup exit. “It is upsetting. He (Billiat) already went to the national team with a tight hamstring, in the two national team matches and there is nothing we can do,” fumed Middendorp. “He was in pain when he played against Botswana. He came back and played in Zambia. It was not going to be possible (to play him against Maritzburg). We tried with his fitness. But it was impossible to bring him in.” The influence of Billiat in the league title-chasing Amakhosi team cannot be over-emphasised. Although he has scored only once in eight league games so far, the twinkle-toed Zimbabwean remains Middendorp’s biggest asset in attack. The Soweto giants are top of log on 28 points from 11 games, yet to drop a point in five success matches.
