SOUTH AFRICA Under-23 coach David Notoane has managed to achieve at least one of two targets he set for himself when he left Mzansi for Egypt early this month. This despite the club versus country dilemma. Notoane went to the eight nations tournament with a depleted squad of 13 players, while some trickled in during the tournament. His goal was to reach the final, which would have seen him automatically qualify for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, next year. But after being booted out in the semi-finals by hosts Egypt, SA made no mistake in the third/fourth place play-off. They deafeted Ghana to qualify for back-to-back Olympics, as they also appeared in 2016. Notoane’s charges join runners-up Ivory Coast and champions Egypt to represent the continent. Now, Notoane has called on Safa and the PSL to make a plan to ensure he gets enough time to prepare players for the tournament which will be played between 24 July to 9 August. Notoane told SunSport: “I came into this tournament with a big headache and I’m now returning home happy, but with another headache. It’s back to the drawing board to prepare for thebigger stage at the upcoming Olympics.”‚ which comes in the period of July to August. Our domestic competition will end in May‚ so that is a big headache I am facing” “There are challenges, there is a domestic league‚ unlike in Egypt where the Football Association stops the league from continuing. He continued: “If I check my calendar then there is only one Fifa break‚ so I hope that I will get support from the FA‚ from the professional clubs‚ to make sure we have a lot of preparation matches and the players available for them.” South Africa also won a third-place play-off four years ago as they beat Senegal on penalties to earn a place at the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
