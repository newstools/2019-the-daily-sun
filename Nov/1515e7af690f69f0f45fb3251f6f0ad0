WHEN his friend asked him to buy beer, he never thought he’d get moered by cops! He was mistaken for a thug. When he tried to explain that he was innocent, the cops apparently didn’t listen to him. Abongile Mayekiso (26) from Betters Life in Philippi East, Cape Town, wants the cops who attacked him on 28 October to pay for what they did. “They almost killed me for something I didn’t do,” he said. Abongile told Daily Sun: “My friend and I were leaving the house. “The cops came and ordered us to get back inside. “The guys they were with said I robbed them.” He said the cops then asked him about a cellphone he stole in Belhar. “I told them they were making a mistake but they wouldn’t listen. They beat me with a sjambok,” he said. “Some kicked me, saying I must take out the cellphone because a cellphone tracker led them to the house.” Abongile said cops searched the house and found the phone. “The owner of the house told them he bought it from someone. They arrested him and left me there in pain,” he said. He opened a case but had not heard anything. Police spokesman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an internal disciplinary process was opened at Philippi East Police Station for investigation and is yet to be finalised. Seisa Sontaga, Acting National spokesperson for IPID said they were still waiting for the report and the case docket from the relevant local police station.
