LITTLE Dewandre Foster is very lucky to be alive. The five-year-old from Mandela Park in Kuruman, Northern Cape, was on Friday shocked by a 263 volt wire in a power box allegedly left open by the municipality. The little boy was pulled away from danger by a neighbour who was washing a car not far from the power box. READ: TV ACTOR AND WIFE HEED CALLING! Dewandre’s mum Elana (28) said what angered her was that residents complained about the open power box on Thursday. “There’s a power box opposite my house and Dewandre was playing hide and seek with his friends there. “There was suddenly screaming and my neighbour ran to pull my son away. “My son could’ve died. The municipal workers were called on Thursday but didn’t do anything when they got here. “I’m thankful to my neighbour Johannes Gouws (42) for saving him. He’s our hero.”   Johannes said he ran like lightning when he heard the little boy screaming. Municipal spokesman David Mabudiwa was not aware of the incident but said he’d investigate. “We will contact the councillor and get the incident report,” Mabudiwa told the People’s Paper.
