NEWLY-CROWNED South African Sportsman of the Year Moruti “BabyFace” Mthalane is happy that boxing is FINALLY getting the recognition it deserves. The International Boxing Federation flyweight champion outboxed Olympic swimmer Chad le Clos and canoeist Andrew Birkett to claim the Sportsman of the Year accolade. An elated pugilist dedicated his triumph to the entire boxing community. “I feel humbled and honoured to win this among the great local champions such as Le Clos and Birkett. This shows that they are noticing what I’m doing inside the ring,” he said. “This is victory for the boxing community after fellow boxers were nominated in the same category in the past SA Sports Awards, but none of them won,” Mthalane. “I’m happy that boxing is getting recognition it deserves and most people will start paying attention to the sport of fistics, and take it seriously. It is a great feeling to win this award when I’m in the last chapters of my boxing career. “Now people will remember me with such achievements.” Boxing has been represented on three occasions of the SA Sports Awards – in 2017 the WBO bantamweight champion Zolani Tete lost to Luvo Manyonga on the Sports Star of year category. Last year Hekkie Budler, the then WBA and IBF junior flyweight champion, was nominated on two categories but was beaten by Caster Semenya and Chad le Clos. The hard-hitting fighter was honoured by Boxing SA earlier this year with a Special Recognition Award for his stunning performances last year, which saw him reclaim his IBF belt. He is scheduled to defend his IBF flyweight crown against Akira Yaegashi at Arena Yokohama in Japan next month. However, the talented fighter said he won’t allow the excitement of winning accolade here at home disturb his preparations for his upcoming battle. He said he will hit the ground running today for his third title defence.
