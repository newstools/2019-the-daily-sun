THUGS escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash yesterday morning. They bombed an ATM at a petrol station in Dwarsloop, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. Shocked petrol attendants heard a loud explosion at about 2am coming from the ATM’s direction in front of the petrol station. “The next thing the ATM was blown into pieces,” said one of two attendants who was on duty at the time of the bombing. “Money flew in the air and scattered around. The thugs helped themselves to the cash.” The petrol attendants felt the whole building shaking! “We hid inside the building, fearing for our lives. We heard pieces of the broken ATM destroying the station’s shop windows,” said another attendant. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said explosives were used to bomb the ATM, leaving cash scattered at the scene. Hlathi urged anyone with information to call Bushbuckridge police on 013 799 5532 or Colonel Beauty Marivate on 072 638 1519.
