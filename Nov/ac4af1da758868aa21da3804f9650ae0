HE WAS shot for wearing pyjamas! The incident left him so traumatised he now locks himself in his room . The sound of gunshots gives him flashbacks.  The 15-year-old boy from KwaNoxolo, in the northern areas of Port Elizabeth, was mistakenly shot and wounded at a spaza shop on 12 July. There is apparently a war over drug spots between a gang that wears pyjamas and another that covers their faces with calamine. READ: WAR OVER IDOLS TWINS! He said he had gone to the spaza at about 8.30pm to buy biscuits. “My sister warned me not to go out, fearing the gang shootings. But I told her I won’t be long. I was wearing my pyjamas and a hoodie. “As I was running I passed two men. One was dressed in pyjamas and another in black clothes. After I put my money on the counter the two men passed behind me. The one in black stood at the street corner,” he said. “But the one in pyjamas came back and pulled out his firearm. I ran and he shot me three times in the back,” he said. His mum (48) said doctors removed three bullets from her son. READ: EYADINI OWNER GETS RID OF HIS R8-MIL CARS! “They said he was lucky to be alive because one of the bullets missed his liver. He was unable to talk for a week. Counselling was organised for him, but he’s still haunted by what happened to him,” she said. She said her son now lives like a prisoner. “The shooting changed his life. He is full of anger and wants to be left alone. I put in an alarm system and burglar gates, but that has not taken away his fear,” she said. Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana said: “The motive for the shooting is unknown. A case of attempted murder was opened but no one has been arrested.”
