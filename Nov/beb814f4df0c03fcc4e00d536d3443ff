ON FRIDAY, Gauteng cops launched their safer festive season operations in Joubert Park, Joburg. And they’ll be all over this season making sure there is law and order! The launch was attended by Police Minister Bheki Cele, his deputy Cassel Mathale, Lieutenant-General Fannie Masemola, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela and Metro police boss David Tembe. Cele said: “You should never die with a gun in your hand. Know when to use it and when not to.” He said cops needed to separate dealing with students, workers and protesters and dealing with hardcore thugs, like those involved in cash-in-transport heists. “Those criminals are dangerous and would eliminate anyone. Deal with them accordingly.” Mawela told the crowd Gauteng cops were ready for the festive season. “We’re ready to deal with any kind of criminality. We’ll be everywhere.” He said they wanted to make Gauteng safe. Tembe said they’d work hand in hand with cops. “When we stop cars, we’ll open boots to see if no one is in there.” He said they also wanted to reduce road deaths.
