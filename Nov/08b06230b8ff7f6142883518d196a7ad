ANOTHER pupil from Nqabakazulu High School in KwaMashu, north of Durban, was found under the influence during exam time. On Friday, the pupil was caught after allegedly smoking dagga during exams. The incident follows another one in September when another pupil was caught drunk before an exam. The two incidents were recorded. In one video, a pupil is seen sitting in an office at the school. He then pours water on himself. He acts funny, stands up and gets out of the office, but then returns again. He can be heard saying: “You’re wasting my time. I’m dying here.” A teacher is then heard asking why he smoked dagga. In another video, a pupil is seen trying to speak, but is too drunk to say anything. He’s seen moving around, trying to get his balance and speak. A teacher in the background can be heard saying: “You’re drunk. Thank you for admitting. You can’t write the exam.” Another pupil said he heard the drunk pupil was drinking with his friends from a nearby school. “They drink a mix of cool drink and cough syrup. This gets them really drunk. He arrived to write, but a teacher saw him and took him to the office,” he said. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said he wasn’t aware of Friday’s incident. He said they were going to investigate the matter. “The issue of drugs is a problem in our schools,” said Mahlambi. “What’s worse is that when the schools deal with these pupils, their parents are the first ones to complain.” He said his department and the Department of Social Development always run drug awareness programmes.
