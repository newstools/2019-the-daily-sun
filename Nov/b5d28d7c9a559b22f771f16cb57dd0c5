CAN South Africa cause another major upset at Egypt’s Cairo International Stadium? In July, South Africa men’s national football team Bafana Bafana caused an upset at the stadium, eliminating the Pharaohs in the last-16 of the seniors Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). And after qualifying for the Afcon Under-23 semi-final, SA coach David Notoane is also looking at repeating the same with his squad. “Naturally, we know what the senior team has done in the Afcon,” Notoane said. “We can draw inspiration from that result, which was not a happy moment for the Egyptians. “We have a job to do, and it is to try and get to the final. There will be a lot of emotions that will come into the game since South Africa eliminated Egypt in the seniors competition. “We will go out to do the same. Our dream is to qualify for the Olympics.” SA Under-23’s kept their 2020 Olympic dream alive when they qualified for the semi-final of the tournament by finishing as runners-up in their tough Group B eliminating rivals Nigeria. By doing so, they have set a date with the host nation Egypt inThe semi-final will be played at Cairo International Stadium on Tuesday. Egypt are the winners of Group A. Earlier in the week, Notoane had revealed he would love to face Egypt in the final of the competition on 22 November. But he will now face them in the semi-final and is not fazed by that. “We knew there was a possibility to play Egypt,” Notoane said. “We will be prepared. For me, it’s a final before the final.” If Notoane’s charges best Egypt they will qualify for next years Olympics Games which will be held in Japan next year. Qualifying will be a huge achievement for coach Notoane considering that he left Mzansi to the tournament with a depleted squad which only had 14 players. However if they lost, they will still get another opportunity of qualifying in the third and forth place play-off match where they will play a loser between Ivory Coast and Ghana.
