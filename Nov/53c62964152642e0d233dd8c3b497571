UNIVERSITY of KZN architecture student Siyabonga Khuzwayo is happy to be the Corobrik Architectural Student of the Year Award winner. Siyabonga (25) from Ndwedwe, north of Durban, was given the award at UKZN’s Howard College on Friday. He designed an iconic traditional healing centre structure.  He told Daily Sun yesterday he came up with the structure after realising that traditional healing didn’t get the respect it deserved. “You find traditional healers doing their work in their indumbas in back yards.

I feel as if justice has been done to my work,” he said.
