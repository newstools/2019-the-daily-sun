AS LIMPOPO reels after the deadly shooting of a cop by her husband on Saturday, Economic Development MEC Thabo Mokone has called on dads to become role models. The man, who was also a police man, apparently turned the gun on himself. READ: 'I TOLD MY WIFE BEFORE THE AUDIO WAS LEAKED!' Mokone told the People’s Paper yesterday: “Parents are better suited to teach boy children the difference between right and wrong at an early age, and to teach them to respect women. The MEC also pleaded with men to change their abusive behaviour. From 25 November to 10 December, various government departments will convene dialogues to mark the 16 Days of Violence Against Women and Children. In light of this campaign, Mokone spoke to Daily Sun shortly after addressing officials in his own department regarding the campaign. Moreover, several other acts of deadly violence against women and children have been reported on in Limpopo recently.
