Junior middleweight fighters Brandon Thysse, Roarke Knapp, Tristan Truter and Boyd Allen will bring the roof down at Emperors Palace tomorrow (Saturday). And as the year draws to a close, up and coming local boxers looks to seal 2019 on a high note when they tear on each other on Saturday night (30 November) at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park.The six-bout boxing extravaganza that will feature the highly anticipated 4@War junior middleweight competition, is the last tournament for Golden Gloves promotions this year.  Four young boxing sensations who will battle against each other for the junior middleweight king spot are Brandon Thysse, Roarke Knapp, Tristan Truter and Boyd Allen. This money spinning local boxing competition will see young gladiators earning the biggest purse of their boxing careers. Beside the much-talked about 4@War competition, the catch-weight contest between two unbeaten SA champions Rowan Campbell and Nicholas Radley is expected to be one of the draw cards.Both boxing sensations are yet to taste a defeat and are also national and African title holders in their respective weight class. Campbell is a king in the super middleweight division while Radley rules the SA light heavyweight and holds the World Boxing Federation (WBF) Africa crown. However, all their crowns are safe for now and the only things on stake are unbeaten records. The fast rising boxer had an eventful year maintain his undefeated record against knowledgeable campaigners.  He is hoping to retain his undefeated record when he clash with an equally talented Western Cape’s Radley. All the fighters have declared their state of readiness and promised sweat, blood and tears at the theatre of dreams. Other bouts: lightweight Shone van Schalkwyk v Katlego Khanyisa, bantamweight Arnel Lubisi v Layton Gloss (4 rounds).
