THE Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) is back in Soweto this weekend. After two full seasons of not hosting festivals of the reserve league, Soweto will be treated to a feast of football as the Diski returns to the historical kasi with three exciting matches on Saturday. Dobsonville Stadium will be the place to be as the venue will host the festival, which consists of three derbies – KwaZulu-Natal, Tshwane and Soweto. The exciting festival activities will start at 11am. Golden Arrows will kick off proceedings with a clash against AmaZulu at 11am, and log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns will entertain SuperSport United at 1pm. The pick of the festival is another Soweto derby, but at the reserves level this time around, between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates at 3pm. Soweto last hosted the MDC festival in February 2016 when Arrows were crowned the Champions at Nike centre. Judging from the 13 matches that have been played so far this season, there’s no doubt that these six teams will not disappoint. Sundowns are going to the weekend leading the pack at the top of the log with 32 points, and SuperSport are third. Sundowns have shown consistency despite having two coaches – David Notoane and Surprise Moriri – alterating in the hot set. Notoane is currently in Egypt wearing his national Under-23 cap, and Moriri will be the man in charge of Downs’ MDC side. But that has not affected them in any way according to Young Brazilians midfield maestro Promise Mkhuma. “We cannot even feel that coach Notoane is not around,” Mkhuma said. “The coaches are similar. We understand Moriri as much as we do with Notoane. They helped us get to the top and we are not looking back.”
