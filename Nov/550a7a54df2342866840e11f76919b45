MARITZBURG UNITED and Ghanaian goalkeeper, Richard Ofori, is said to be the flavour of the moment. According to SunSport sources, the player has courted attention from a club in Belgium. But this comes as no surprise. Since Ofori joined Maritzburg in 2017 from Ghanaian side Wa All Stars, he has been responsible for carrying the team and his country with distinction. “It’s true that there’re talks with Maritzburg regarding Ofori,” said the insider. “Maritzburg chairperson, Farouk Kadodoia has also informed the players’ agent that there’s interest from Belgium.” The Team of Choice’s chairperson Kadodia revealed that there are clubs who have showed interest in Ofori, but it’s still in its infancy. “I’ve been told by Ofori’s agent that there’s an inquiry, but there’s nothing more than that,” said Kadodia. “The club hasn’t received anything whatsoever. So, I can’t comment on it. There’s no offers at all.” The 26-year-old goalie, who was in goals when the Black Stars defeated Bafana Bafana 2-0 in the opening match of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers at Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday, is in the last year of his contract with the club. Maritzburg are pressed to cash in on him in January or try and extend his contract as they might lose him for free end of the season.Failure to do, the player in January, with six months left on his contract, is liable to talk to the club of his choice. In his first season in the league, Ofori’s signing was evident as Maritzburg broke plenty of the club’s records. He helped Maritzburg to their highest ever finish, fourth in the 2017/18 season.on. In the same season, the Midland club reached their maiden cup final, Nedbank, in which they lost to Free State Stars. He was then nominated for PSL Goalkeeper of the Season along Denis Onyango, but he lost it out to Itumeleng Khune.
