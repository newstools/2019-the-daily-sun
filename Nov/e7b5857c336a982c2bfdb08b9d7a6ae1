UNTIL recently they were strangers, but today they are at war over the same body. The Nkani family from KwaThema in Ekurhuleni claim the dead man is their relative. They said they found keys on his decaying body and the keys opened the doors to the house where he lived. Meanwhile, the Sibanda family from Zimbabwe said their loved one had a chipped tooth and they’re sure it’s him.  To settle the fight, cops have decided to do DNA tests. But the Nkanis said they know the DNA is going to take a long time.

She said her brother Samukelo Nkani (30) went to buy stock in Joburg during the xenophobic attacks in September. He spoke to her on the phone and he said he was on his way home when his phone went off. Nomthandazo opened a missing person’s case the following day at KwaThema Police Station.  “Then we saw stories in our local newspaper that two male bodies were found last month.” She said the first body was not her brother, but the second, found on the road near the N17 motorway near Springs, was her brother. “He had keys and they opened his house,” she said. Captain Johannes Ramphora of Springs cop shop confirmed the two families came forward to claim the same body. He said the two families would have to wait for the DNA test results.
