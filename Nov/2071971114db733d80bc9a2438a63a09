Rapper Cassper Nyovest didn’t honour his interview commitment and DJ Fresh called him unprofessional. The star who is currently preparing for his #FillUpRoyalBafokeng was scheduled to have an interview with DJ Fresh yesterday on his 947 radio show. According to the response he wrote to one of the fans he said he couldn’t make it to the show as he was tired and was passing out while on set. The Tito Mboweni hitmaker said this show means so much to him as it is his homecoming. A fan expressed how happy they are that Fresh called out the rapper for being unprofessional. The fan said Cassper was once paid by some company to do a campaign but he did a half job because he complained that he was hungry. Responding to the fan’s tweet Cassper wrote: “Then there’s this. People would rather see you break down or bedridden than understand when you tired or not feeling well. I won’t always be at my best, I won’t be okay every single time. I’m sorry I couldn’t make Fresh’s show today I was literally passing out on set I’m human.”
