THE Special Investigating Unit yesterday raided Lepelle Northern Water’s head offices in Polokwane. It obtained a court order on Friday allowing it to raid the offices over the unfinished Giyani R3,5 billion water project. The project, launched by former president Jacob Zuma, has been in progress since August 2014. It was meant to supply water to Giyani and nearby villages. But for the past eight years the 50 villages have had no clean drinking water. Workers at the water agency were evacuated when forensic officials arrived in the morning. They stood outside for over three hours while investigators loaded piles of boxes into their vehicles. Investigating unit spokesman Kaizer Kganyago told the People’s Paper: “We’ve been asking them to provide us with information and they weren’t forthcoming. “After we’ve finished our investigations, we’ll take the matter to court if we find the contract was entered into illegally. Then we’ll recover the money.” Water agency spokesman Simon Mpamonyane assured the SunTeam that they co-operated fully. “We’re compelled to give them every document they need,” said Mpamonyane.
