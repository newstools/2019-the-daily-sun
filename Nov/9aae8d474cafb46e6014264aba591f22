THE fire which broke out inside public toilets has highlighted a problem residents have complained about for months. The toilets at the corner of Baakens Street and Govan Mbeki Avenue in Port Elizabeth are run down. Residents have said Nelson Mandela Bay mayor, Mongameli Bobani, should revamp the toilets that have been unused for many years. WAR OVER IDOLS TWINS! The toilets are less than 50m from Bobani’s offices and not more than 20m from the Noninzi Luzipho Building, which houses councillors. Resident Rodney Speelman (43) said: “People are being robbed of their valuables when passing through here at night or over weekends.” Steven Lake (36), who lives close to the Donkin Reserve in Central, said: “The toilets are in a strategic place where tourists and visitors come to view the city hall and the popular Vuyisile Mini square. “How can tourists come here when the place is dirty and smells of kak?” WATCH: FIGHT FOR C63 AMG! A Nelson Mandela University student said: “Students have been robbed of valuables such as laptops and cellphones by criminals living in the toilets.” Mayoral spokesman George Geleba admitted that the toilets had been vandalised. “There’s already a budget set aside to completely renovate them,” Geleba said. “The municipality will request the human settlements and land invasion unit to remove the vagrants with the assistance of security services, Metro police and cops.” He said the municipality was still investigating the cause of Friday’s fire. No one was injured.
