TV ACTOR Ntiyiso Mkhari (27) and his fiancee Thandiwe Buthelezi (26) are now healers. They accepted their callings after their lives became a living hell.  They told the SunTeam they met in September last year and escaped death in separate car crashes. They fell sick and were forced to drop out of college.

Limpopo-born Ntiyiso, who’s on local dramas such as SABC1’s Makoti and e.tv’s Rhythm City, and his Soweto fiancee graduated under traditional healer Dr Annuary Ndlovu in Orinocco, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. “I almost died by ignoring my ancestral calling. Trouble kept following me,” he said. “Big brands would sign me for adverts or acting roles and refuse to pay me for my work. I also had terrible headaches. “My mother got sick earlier this year, and every time I visited her I’d see a fresh bone on the pavement, which was explained as a sign of ancestral calling.” Ntiyiso said they spent over R70 000 trying to get help but nothing helped. “Thandiwe opened my eyes and sangomas warned me that to save my mother’s life I must accept my calling,” said Ntiyiso.

She said her late father, a sangoma, came to her in her dreams asking her to heed the calling. “But I ignored it until I met Ntiyiso and shared my story with him,” said Thandiwe. Dr Ndlovu said: “This couple had amazingly taken the same route to becoming healers.” He thanked Daily Sun for connecting people to him.”
