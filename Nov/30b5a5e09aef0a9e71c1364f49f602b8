MOST matrics said yesterday’s Afrikaans paper 2 wasn’t difficult and they were expecting good results. Thatego Mateta from Meridian High School in Tlhabane, near Rustenburg in North West, said she enjoyed the drama and poetry sections. Oratile Seleke said the paper was okay. She’s not sure how well she did. Millicent Matela said the drama questions were easy to understand. Oratile Hlangwane said one of the poetry questions was difficult, while Boitumelo Motsatsing said she was expecting a level 6 pass. Thandeka Mvunelo from Pinetown Girls High in Durban, KZN, said she enjoyed the poetry section because she studied hard for it. Lyanne Mhlongo (18) said the paper was easy. “I’m aiming for 80%,” said a very positive Lyanne.
