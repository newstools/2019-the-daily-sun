WHEREVER Nhlanhla Mabasa goes, people apparently move away. The 19-year-old from Mudavula Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, has such bad body odour people call him Mr Toilet. He told Daily Sun: “I’m failing to cope with this odour. It’s literally turned my life into hell. I’ve become a loner.” READ: WATCH: SPINNING A BMW M3 GONE WRONG!  He said he’d tried all kinds of things to deal with his condition, but nothing worked. “I’ve used expensive fragrances, tried to bath more than four times a day and consulted all kinds of doctors, but I can’t seem to find anything that helps.” He told the SunTeam he’d given up hope of ever fixing the problem, or finding a girlfriend. “My whole body smells so bad. I think someone evil is behind this and I’m begging them to take it back,” he said. The situation had led him to drop out of school in grade 11 as he couldn’t take being called names anymore.

I’ve tried the western way to deal with this but given up.” He’d like traditional healers to help him. Mum Lydia said her son’s condition was frustrating. “It affects me and puts strain on the family.” Dr Ammonia Mabasa from Malamulele Hospital said: “Nhlanhla is probably suffering from trimethylaminuria, a condition that’s not curable. “The patient can only use fragrance to make sure he deals with the smell.”
