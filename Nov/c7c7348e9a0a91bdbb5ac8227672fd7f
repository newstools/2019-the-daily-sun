THE City of Joburg is serious about curbing drinking and driving. On Friday MMC for public safety Michael Sun launched the second Alcohol Evidence Centre in Marlboro, north of Joburg. He was joined by outgoing Joburg mayor, Herman Mashaba. The centre will be used by Joburg Metro police, along with other law-enforcement agencies, to fight drinking and driving. Motorists will be tested with the evidential breath alcohol test instrument launched last year. The alcohol breathalyser gives a printout of a driver’s alcohol level on the spot without having to draw blood. Sun said: “The performance statistics released earlier this month by the Metro police department revealed that 2 924 arrests were made for driving under the influence of alcohol in the first quarter. “Disconcertingly, arrests made from drunk driving reveal that our motorists remain stubborn and continue to put the lives of others at risk.” He said 1 033 suspects were arrested in September for driving under the influence, and the number increased to 1 043 last month. Sun said the rise was concerning when compared to July, when 790 arrests were made for drunk driving. Mashaba urged the police never to fear arresting anyone, including their own mayor, if found to have broken the law. He said: “For law enforcement to succeed, they need to operate without fear or favour. “Drinking and driving in our city is unacceptable. “People must know that when you drink on our roads we’ll catch you.”
