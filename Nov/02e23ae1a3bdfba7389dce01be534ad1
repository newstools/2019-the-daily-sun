 Friends, family and fans were packed at the Assemblies of God Church in Sandton, north of Jozi. They were at the memorial to celebrate the life of the humble and legendary actor Andile Gumbi. Ron Kunene who is one of the original members of the Lion King said Andile was a unique man.  “He was fierce, he was fearless - he exuded the spirit of ubuZulu,” Ron said. Kunene said Andile might be gone but: “He is not lost, his spirit still lives, he was the first South African to place the character of Simba on Broadway. He made history,” He added.  Kunene also pointed out that the South African government needs to support artists in the country because they represent the country well abroad. Desiree Markgraaff from Bomb Production which produces Isibaya said: “He was born to be a King, he was born to become a king,” Desiree said.  Markgraaff was describing how many of Gumbi’s characters where based on him portraying the character of a king. “I want to thank Duma KaNdlovu who introduced Andile to Bomb Productions,” Desiree said.   According to Desiree, when Andile came for auditions on Isibaya he came looking dapper. The legendary actor was described as a person who loved looking dapper and clean. The actor who was described as a humble person reportedly complained about being tired just days before suffering a heart attack. The heart attack lead to Gumbi being in a coma for several days while he was in Jerusalem, Israel, on 25 October.
