HE saved money for five long years to buy the love of his life a R10 000 engagement ring – but Joshua Mayine (46) is stuck with it.  The man from Hostel One in Mangaung explained his girlfriend, Monki Montse (45), said she won’t live in a place that stank so badly! “She dumped me even though I put a ring on her finger,” said Joshua. DUMPED BEFORE EXAMS “She complained about the dirty water in front of the door. She said she couldn’t live like a pig.” His girlfriend left him and took their daughter to QwaQwa. Now Joshua is left nursing a broken heart. He told Daily Sun: “I don’t know why a person doesn’t tell you when they don’t love you anymore. I’m struggling to focus at work. I loved that woman and I know she loved me, too. She can’t dump me because of dirty water. It’s not my fault!” Monki said she met Joshua in QwaQwa. “Earlier this year I moved to his place. The place was bad for me and my two-year-old daughter. I dumped him and moved back home. I’m sorry. But if he can’t find another place, I can’t live like that,” she said. “I was looking forward to tying the knot with Joshua but I refuse to live in a smelly dump like that.” Joshua said he didn’t have money to rent another place. “I don’t want to marry another woman. I will wait for her,” he said.
