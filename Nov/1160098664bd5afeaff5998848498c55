So government sees it fit to introduce comprehensive sexuality education in schools? Did you know that politicians’ kids don’t attend public schools, where this curriculum is being taught? Private schools reject such a curriculum. Only children of poor blacks will be exposed to explicit content. My daughter’s school won’t expose kids to such. In fact, government should have introduced coding, robotics, investing and trading. The world is shifting towards digitisation. Meanwhile, our government is shifting towards sexualisation.
