Eagle-eyed fans have taken to social media to ask: What have the Springboks done with the Webb Ellis Cup's lid? The 2019 Rugby World Cup-winning Springboks are currently on a five-day Champions Tour of the country with the final leg scheduled for Cape Town later on Monday. Prior to their departure, SA Rugby insured the Webb Ellis Cup for R570 000.However, despite the insurance, it appears for safety reasons and ease of transport, they have elected to leave the lid at SA Rugby HQ with numerous photos emerging of a lid-less cup being paraded around the Rainbow Nation. The lid was in place when the team returned to South Africa after beating England 32-12 in the final in Yokohama on Saturday, November 2.One fan decided the culprit was scrumhalf Faf de Klerk, but a SA Rugby spokesperson confirmed that the lid is "safe" and simply wasn't worth the risk.On a more serious note, the Springboks were forced to apologise after a delay to their schedule meant they missed out on seeing several fans on Sunday's Port Elizabeth visit."Humble apologies to the northern areas of PE today who missed out on our planned visit," a Twitter post read."Massive crowds, congestion and a waiting flight to Cape Town meant an unavoidable last minute route change. We are as disappointed as you, and we do apologise sincerely." Humble apologies to the northern areas of PE today who missed out on our planned visit.
