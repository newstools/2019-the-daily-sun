Gogo Florah Mashabela (62) is desperately pleading for a
wheelchair donation from a good samaritan. The gogo is requesting for a wheelchair to make life simple
for her granddaughter Matlatsi Mashabela. She said Matlatsi (16) can have a better life since she has
difficulty walking. Gogo Flora said she has nothing, and she cannot afford to
buy one with her pension grant. She said her granddaughter Matlatsi only leaves the yard
when she is going to school. The old woman from Siyabuswa section 'C' in Mpumalanga said
it pains her to see other children playing outside while Matlatsi is stuck in
the house. "My granddaughter cannot go to play outside; she only
leaves the yard in the morning when going to school. She has become a
laughingstock to other kids at school. “She does not even have friends to play with. This worries
her and does not concentrate well to her studies. Her scholar transport
collects her at the gate and drops her in the afternoon. “It’s like she does not have a life. It pains me when I look
at her trying to walk and I could see that she is struggling," she said. "I wish a good Samaritan could come forward and help
her with a wheelchair. Her life can be better and will be able to visit other
kids to do schoolwork. Her body has grown big and can no longer lift her up. “The more her body becomes bigger the more she finds it
difficult to walk. Before we used to pick her up but since she started taking
her epilepsy medication, she has become very heavy," she said. Gogo Florah told Daily Sun that Matlatsi cannot do anything
for herself. She said they bath and dress her. “I am now too old, and her situation has become worse. All
she needs is an electric wheelchair.”
