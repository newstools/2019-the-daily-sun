BAFANA Bafana coach Melofi Ntseki has confirmed that the team will be without Bongani Zungu for their second Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan on Sunday. Bafana went down 2-0 to Ghana in their opening 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday night. Goals from Thomas Partey and Mohammed Kudus in either half ensured the Black Stars shine bright. Now Bafana will host Sudan in their second 2021 Afcon qualifier at Orlando Stadium on Sunday afternoon, (3pm) hoping for a positive result to keep their qualifying hopes alive. Zungu was forced to come out through injury in less than 30 minutes on Thursday night. “We saw everybody that we have in the camp will still be available except for Bongani Zungu who suffered a knee injury,” Ntseki told reporters after the match. “We have a balanced team and we are looking forward to play the best team on Sunday and do well. In the qualifiers you always have those situations where you lose some matches. He added: “I think we prepared the team very well for back to back matches, we were fully aware that we play the first match in Ghana and another one in South Africa.” Last month, Zungu withdrew from the squad to face Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge in PE. Kamohelo Mokotjo, who was not on the match day squad on Thursday due to fitness concerns could possibly replace Zungu for the Sudan clash.
