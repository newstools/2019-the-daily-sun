KAIZER Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama has been called up to the Bafana Bafana team to replace injured Themba Zwane. Manyama returns to the national team set-up after a lengthy absence. He last represented his country in 2017 with his last match in national colours being Bafana’s World Cup qualifier against Senegal nearly two years ago. He will join Molefi Ntseki’s squad as they prepare to face Ghana and Sudan in their opening two 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Thursday and Sunday. Bafana travel to Cape Coast for their tussle against the Black Stars before hosting The Falcons three days later at the Orlando Stadium. “Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Lebogang Manyama has been called up to Bafana Bafana for the two crucial Cameroon 2021 Africa Cup of Nations clashes against Ghana and Sudan,” Safa confirmed. “Manyama, who has already reported for national team duty, replaces the injured Themba Zwane of Mamelodi Sundowns.”
