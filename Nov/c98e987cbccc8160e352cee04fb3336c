THE football rationale of Maritzburg United coach, Eric Tinkler, and his assistant Vincent Kobola, will come to test this weekend when they meet Kaizer Chiefs at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday. Their analytical football brains have been tested by club boss Farook Kadodia who has described Mbombela Stadium as foreign land to them, as he refuses to accept a day they lose to his former employee Ernst Middendorp in the second Telkom Knockout semi-final. “We are all looking forward to this game,” Kadodia vowed. “We have been in many cup semi-finals before. You talk about Nedbank Cup and Telkom, Absa Cup, whatever it was, but only Nedbank Cup that we reached the final (in 2017-18). “We have a desire to go to the final of this cup now. But it is not going to be easy playing in Mbombela. “I know the players will be up for it. And I’m sure anything can happen.” The last time Maritzburg were at this stage of the TKO was back in the 2010-11 season when they lost 3-0 to Orlando Pirates. Interestingly, Middendorp was in charge of the team. Middendorp, who has had three stints in coaching Maritzburg, was also a lifesaver of the club and has cemented his close affinity with the Team of Choice’s management. “With due respect to Ernst, he’s a very good coach. He worked with me very well, and we still have a good relationship,” revealed Kadodia. “But the reality is that it’ll be 90 allocated minutes of football. I can assure you we will fight to our strength against Ernst and his team.” Unfortunately, Maritzburg will be without suspended defender Kwanda Mngonyama.
