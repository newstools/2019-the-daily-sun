JACOB ZUMA is not well. His lawyers sent a message that Zuma was sick and will not appear at the Zondo Commission. “The commission has been informed by legal representatives of former president Zuma that he’s ill and unable to attend the hearings scheduled for 11 to 15 November,” the commission said in a statement yesterday. “Dates for further hearings will be communicated in due course.” Zuma was initially set to appear in October but his appearance was postponed because he had another case in the Pietermaritzburg High Court in KZN. That matter is related to the arms deal. Zuma is accused of taking bribes worth R4 million before he became president. When Zuma appeared before commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo in July, the former president denied any involvement in a corrupt relationship with the Gupta family. Zuma claimed that on 15 July, after his first day of testimony, his life and his children’s lives had been threatened by an unknown caller who phoned his PA. The commission has also announced that Peter Hain will appear on 18 November. “Lord Hain has volunteered to give evidence before the commission,” the statement said. Hain, who was born in South Africa, is a former UK Labour cabinet minister. According to News24, he has written to the UK’s finance minister, Sajid Javid, to follow the US lead and impose a series of tough sanctions against the Gupta family.
