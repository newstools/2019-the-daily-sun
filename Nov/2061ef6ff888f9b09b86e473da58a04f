Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp says he always has confidence in young defender Siyabonga Ngezana to step into the team. The 22-year-old Ngezana was missed by Amakhosi for the last few weeks as he was with the South Africa U23 side that qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by coming third at the Under-23 African Cup of Nations. Ngezana arrived back at the Soweto giants and went straight into the starting line-up against Stellenbosch FC with Eric Mathoho still serving a suspension and promptly scored the opener in a 4-0 victory. Middendorp said it was a pity that Ngezana was not available for the Telkom Knockout defeat against Maritzburg United on Sunday. The Kaizer Chiefs mentor said: "Siyabonga Ngezana, we released him over the week, I would have loved to have him available on Sunday. "I know there is an element of winning mentality that we get from Eric Mathoho and the only replacement that we have in this moment is Siyabonga Ngezana. "He came back, trained twice and for me it was not a question at all to bring him in and I think it was a very qualified performance. "This is something that I am not too worried about, we have now 10 days, who can make it, we are dealing with around 30 players but we will find the combinations." Absa Premiership log leaders Chiefs are next in action on 7 December when they take on Bloemfontein Celtic. -Sport24
