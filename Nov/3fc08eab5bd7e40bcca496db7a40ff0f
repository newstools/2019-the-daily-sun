BLACK Leopards coach Luc Eymael missed out on an opportunity to coach Orlando Pirates. The 60-year-old Belgian could have fulfilled his dream of leading one of the biggest teams in South African football. The out-spoken Belgian mentor claims that he had the contract in his hand, but due to unforeseen circumstances things did not go the way he had expected. Imagine how his coaching career would have turned out if, he had grabbed that opportunity with both hands. Eymael is known for the entertaining brand of football that his teams play. When he first arrived in Mzansi, he was coming here to take over the coaching reins at Pirates. The first person that he met in SA football circles, is Bucs official Floyd Mbele. Eymael said: “We didn’t reach an agreement that’s why I ended up not signing on the dotted lines. We didn’t come to some form of agreement. "Things just didn’t work out for the both of us, but that misfortune helped me to get to know the PSL much better.” Eymael continues:“That is all I’m prepared to say, I’m with Leopards now and I’m happy. ”The former Polokwane City, Free State Stars and Bloemfontein Celtic coach, is hoping to help the Venda based outfit to win a trophy. Eymael is now focusing on turning the Limpopo based outfit into a formidable force in domestic football. He says that he has changed the mentality of the players to believe in themselves. Lidoda Duvha showed character as they twice fought from a goal down to force a 2-2 draw against Super Sport United in their previous league game before the Fifa International break. Leopards host Cape Town City at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Sunday afternoon (3.30pm). Eymael concluded: “We have a good team and I told the players to believe in themselves and to play good football. I changed a lot of things in the team when I got here.”
