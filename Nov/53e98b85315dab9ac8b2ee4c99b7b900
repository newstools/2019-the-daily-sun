What do you think of this retro-looking Bafana Bafana jersey designed by a young lad from the East Rand? Young designer Karabo Kvrvbo Moloi from Nigel on the East Rand is getting rave reviews after he designed a Bafana Bafana jeysey with the 1996 retro-feel. "Got some time to play around again, so I decided to recreate  the iconic 96' Bafana Bafana jersey merged with a Nike template..and maybe, just maybe..we might win the next World Cup. Yes?No? What you guys think?" posted Moloi on his FaceBook page. It seems like many FaceBook users are loving the 1996 feel on the design. In 1996 Bafana Bafana won the Africa Cup of Nations tournament and this seems to be what has inspired Moloi's drawing and design.
