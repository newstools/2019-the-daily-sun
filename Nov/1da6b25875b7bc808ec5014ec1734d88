WINNING the Soweto derby is a priority to Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp. The German coach showed the importance of gaining bragging rights in the derby as he rested eight key players in their 2-0 win over Chippa United in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. Middendorp fielded the likes of Kgotso Moleko, Philani Zulu, Ramahlwe Mphahlele and Kabelo. Mahlasela who have not been getting too much game time this season. The German mentor who has only dropped four points in 10 matches this season has explained reason behind massive changes he made. “This is crucial that the medical team have a say in guiding and giving report about the players,” Middendorp stated. “The doctors gave me instructions on conditions of the players. It is very clear I have to listen to the technical advice. He went on: “We had to make sure which players we travel with, and the doctors said definitely not Lebogang (Manyama), definitely not Khama (Billiat), not Eric (Mathoho), please be careful with Yagan Sasman.” “And there were no any ambition with Reeve Frosler and Kearyn Baccus. "But it was very clear, listen to the medical department listen to the sport science what can we do, which players are not used and in the end,  you have to make a combination out of what is then requested. “Other cases were obvious in our selection. Daniel Akpeyi is clearly on three yellow cards and we had to look at that and make a decision in that area. I’m glad Bruce Bvuma played well and kept a clean sheet.”
