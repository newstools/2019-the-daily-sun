Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane admits he didn't anticipate his team losing 3-2 against Golden Arrows in the Absa Premiership on Sunday. The Brazilians opened the scoring through Thapelo Morena just before the half-time break, but the hosts soon took control with Danisa Phiri levelling matters before Knox Mutiza put Abafana Bes'thende ahead and followed it up with a third via the penalty spot. Andile Jali pulled one back for the travellers but it wasn't enough. Mosimane was disappointed with the result and the conditions underfoot at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium. "As I said difficult game, what can you say difficult conditions for both teams obviously. Ja, the biggest mistake by our number one goalkeeper [Denis Onyango], it happens, it's the conditions," Mosimane told SuperSport TV. "He applied the wrong technique and the ball bounced differently but it's okay, we accept [defeat]. "We tried to get the speed behind, that change helped us, that's why 'Vila' [Vilakazi] managed to go through on the right once or twice. I though [Divine] Lunga could've been booked on that foul because the referee spoke to him three times. "I thought the third time he was going to book him, but he didn't, it's okay. We got the goal, we could've scored another one in the last minute, to be honest, but it's OK, it's difficult conditions, a difficult game for us. Ja, I never thought we'll lose this game." Sundowns will have a chance at redemption when they take on Arrows in the Telkom Knockout semi-finals on 23 November. SOURCE :Â SPORT24
