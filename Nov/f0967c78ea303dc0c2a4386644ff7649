THE Crown Gospel Music Awards have described claims that the results were unfair as uninformed. Awards spokesman Sipho Khaleni yesterday responded to the claims on behalf of founder Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule. Khaleni said: “The awards committee is noting with concern and disappointment all the uninformed negative comments making the rounds on social media. “They were made by a few uninformed individuals who fail to ask us relevant questions in order to gain understanding and facts.”  Khaleni said the results were determined by service provider, SABC Mobile. “They handle the results independently without any interference from us. The numbers read out on stage is data provided to us and we add nothing to them,” he said. “When we receive the results from our service provider, are we now expected to lie to the public and announce the winner based on popularity and not the actual numbers received?”  Khaleni said those making claims needed to show proof. “We further challenge them to open a criminal case if they find anything untoward against us as an organisation. However, if those individuals continue to make such unfounded claims, we will be forced to file a lawsuit against them for defamation and bringing our organisation into disrepute,” he said.
