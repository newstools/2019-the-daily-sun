Taxi passengers were
forced to take matters into their own hands on Monday, after realising their
driver was under the influence of alcohol. The passengers on
board the 15-seater taxi managed to alert a passing metro police vehicle to
assist them. "The passengers
screamed at officers who were passing, cautioning that the taxi driver was
highly intoxicated and couldn't even drive straight. The vehicle was
swerving," JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said. The incident happened
on the M1 north freeway, near 11th Avenue. Minnaar said the driver had recorded
a DUI reading of 1.74mg/l which is way above the legal limit for professional
drivers.  He said, after the man
was tested, he was immediately arrested and faces a drunk driving charge. He is
expected to appear in court later this week. Minnaar added that the
arrest was a warning to motorists that no drunk driving would be tolerated
during festive season and that all perpetrators would be arrested and detained. JMPD chief David Tembe
shared the incident to his Twitter page, eliciting a positive reaction from
users who lauded the passengers for their bravery and good deed. "It's about time
passengers alert officers of these taxi drivers that put their lives in danger.
I always wonder, why are passengers allowing taxi drivers to skip red
robots...drive recklessly nje. #VivaPassengers," one user replied. SOURCE: NEWS24
