WOMEN have come together to find ways to grow their footprint in the South African economy. Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Maite Nkoana-Mashabane hosted a special conference in Tswhane aimed at bringing women-led businesses, hawkers, spaza shop owners, big businesses, banks and other funders together.  The conference was a platform for women to work together to find ways to get rid of barriers. Nkoana-Mashabane said President Cyril Ramaphosa was on a drive to attract investment to South Africa. “The question we should ask ourselves is: ‘How much is being committed to investing in women-owned companies or projects?’” she said. “When we talk about investment, we’re not only focusing on foreign investment. “We’re also talking about the private sector as they have a role to play in economic transformation and job creation.” READ: HE DIED ON THE SPOT! Nkoana-Mashabane said in the second quarter of the year, it was reported that the mining industry employed 381 000 people and only 13,6% of these were women. “The challenges faced by women in mining include the underground risk of sexual harassment and sexual violence,” she said. Nkoana-Mashabane said mines needed to do more to keep women safe. “We need the mindset of male colleagues to be transformed from being patriarchal and sexist and only seeing women as objects to be abused,” she said. Nkoana-Mashabane said areas of concern to women were poverty, health and the economy.
