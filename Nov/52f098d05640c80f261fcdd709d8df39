DAYS of being squashed in a one-roomed mud house are over for this family of eight. Thandekile Dludla (50) and her family got an early Christmas present when the Umhlathuze Municipality handed them keys to a furnished four-roomed house. PICS: SAXONWOLD GUPTA HOUSE SOLD! Thandekile lives with her two unemployed daughters, aged 29 and 32, and her five grandkids. “I couldn’t afford to build my family a decent house. “I’m unemployed. We thank God that we have a shelter over our heads. I’m over the moon,” she said. Thandekile said during recent heavy rains, they were forced to spend nights mopping up water that leaked into the house. LOTTO WINNER WON'T QUIT HIS JOB! “I was worried the house would one day collapse on us.” The mayor’s wife, Thandeka Mhlongo, handed Thandekile keys to the house. Said Thandeka: “It’s heartbreaking to sleep in the comfort of your bed knowing there are people who don’t have shelter. “I came to know about their situation through a colleague who goes to the same church as Thandekile.”
