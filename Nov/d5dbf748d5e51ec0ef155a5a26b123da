ASPIRING farmer Themba Makana is passionate about what he does and wants to put his name on the map. Makana is farming chilli peppers and dreams of becoming a major supplier of the produce in Mpumalanga. The 28-year-old from Dingleydale Village near Bushbuckridge, said farming ran in the family. He said that was why he decided to take over from where his mum left when she retired. “I come from a family where we grew up watching my mother farming. After she decided to retire, I thought it would be great to continue with her work, especially after I was unable to find formal work,” he said. “After searching for a job for many years without success, I decided to venture into farming. Becoming a farmer was my only option to fend for my family,” Themba said. He said one had to have a passion and love for farming to make a success of it. “With the high rate of unemployment in our country, young people should consider studying agriculture as they can make a living out of it,” he said. Themba supplies his chillies to a local supermarket and hawkers around the village and outside the province. “I’m motivated to work hard so I can have more customers. I am grateful for all those who support me,” he said.
