BLACK Friday is here. And thousands of people across Mzansi will go on a shopping spree. Black Friday will be on 29 November. The day marks the start of the busy holiday shopping season. Shopping malls and retailers will be busier than usual. Therefore, it’s important to remember one’s personal safety. Katherine Madley, marketing director of Game and Dion Wired, said they have prepared for the day and are promising a great shopping experience for customers. Katherine said they have 122 Game stores in Mzansi and a further 28 in 11 other African countries. “Game has 115 stores while Dion has 22,” she said. She said only 96 shops will be opened overnight across the continent starting from 8pm on 28 November. Shoppers can also order stuff online if they don’t want to walk into their stores on the day. Katherine said they also will hire over 1 000 people especially for this day to help in their shops to make sure shoppers shop safely. She said this a big opportunity for people to save money during Black Friday since things are expensive these days. “People don’t have to take a day’s leave to enjoy Black Friday. They can come to our stores anytime from overnight to during the day on 29 November to buy whatever they want to buy.” Katherine said the security will be tight and Customer Care services will be also helpful to ensure that shoppers shop successfully. She encourages people to bring their IDs with them in case they will want to buy TVs which will also be very cheaper on the day because buying a TV one will need a TV licences. They will be opening a new store in Louis Trichardt in Venda, Limpopo, in May/June next year.
