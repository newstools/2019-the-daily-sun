PUBLIC Transport Voice spokesman Dalton Ndongeni believes cops alone won’t win the fight against robbers targeting commuters. He said this after another Golden Arrow bus was robbed in Mitchells Plain, Cape Town, on Thursday.  The robbery happened despite police officers being sent to buses recently. “This is a societal matter. These thugs come from our communities and many people know them but don’t report them to cops. That’s why crime is increasing. We need communities to work with cops,” he said. Mbali Mlinda (36), who travels from Parow to Mitchells Plain daily, said thugs targeted them in the morning and evening. “They know there will be many people to rob and they will get lots of money and cellphones,’’ said Mbali. “I’ve been using this route for the past 10 years and witnessed countless robberies.” READ: 'I TOLD MY WIFE BEFORE THE AUDIO WAS LEAKED!' “When cops were introduced, it looked as if things were getting better, but it seems we’re back to our usual struggles again.” He said it wasn’t possible to put a cop on every bus. “From our point of view, there’s a need for government and all stakeholders to engage the community on crime and come up with solutions,” said Ndongeni. “There should be trust between cops and members of the community.” Golden Arrow’s Bronwen Dyke-Beyer said the robbery took place at about 7am on New Eisleben Road.
