SAFA are still keen on having national team scouts overseas. And according to the blueprint Molefi Ntseki has presented to his Safa bosses, the association could soon have scouts, possibly including Benni McCarthy. McCarthy is unemployed after being jettisoned at Cape Town City and speculation has been rife that he could be roped in at Safa. Safa president Danny Jordaan has refused to be drawn on whether or not McCarthy could be roped in at Safa, though he acknowledged his good work at City.

They will be helping each other for the senior and the junior teams. Having one scout will be difficult for them to be all over and give us a technical report on our players overseas. “It’s just unfortunate that coach Benni had to lose his job at City. But that doesn’t mean he is not a good coach. He is a good coach, a legend of the game. And he’s qualified to do the job for us. When that time comes, we will consider him.”
