A guy is left fuming after someone sneaks up and locks padlock to his earlobe then runs away. Taking to Facebook, Tom Grim Fandango Matthews swore he doesn’t know who locked the padlock in his ear. ‘So guess what some little w*** stain just did to me if I find you I will put you 6 feet under end of rant c*** [sic]’, he wrote after posting the below picture on Facebook. He explained that he was having a cigarette “out back” when he “heard a click turned round and realized there was a padlock on my ear and tried to chase em. ”Matthews was furious that someone had crept up on him. He posted a picture of the lock on the social media site, along with an angry threat to the culprit. But if he was expecting sympathy, or someone to join him in his rage, he was disappointed. His friends just found the whole thing hilarious.
