SOME residents of this kasi have been living with lakes of kak in their yards for many years. Mxolisi Kwani (57) from Kwa Nomathamsanqa, Eastern Cape, said many houses on Dlongwana Street were always filled with stinking water.  “This situation started about 10 years ago. It seems the houses were built on top of a sewerage pipe that eventually burst,” he said. “The municipality is not helping, despite having received several complaints. Our kids can’t play outside in their yards. “We’re also close to the Addo sports field, which is always affected. The whole area is filled with sewage. We’re really desperate for help.” A resident of Sonwabo Street, which is behind Dlongwana Street, said the situation got worse when it rained. The woman said: “We live with pigs and dogs that scavenge for worms and kak in the sewage. “Our houses and furniture have been damaged and there are many mosquitoes, worms and rats. “We’re angry because we’ve been complaining to the Sundays River Valley Municipality, but nothing happened.” Municipal spokeswoman Zusiphe Mtirara said they were busy upgrading the town’s sewerage system. “There’s a project currently underway to upgrade sewer lines, which will address the issue of overflowing drains and blockages in the area,” she said. “We always plead with residents to stop throwing foreign objects into the drains as it worsens the situation,” she said.
