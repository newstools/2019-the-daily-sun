THE seven-year-old girl who was kidnapped from her school on Wednesday has been found unharmed. She was kidnapped by an unknown woman at Imbewenhle Primary School in Mandeni, KZN. Her 28-year-old dad said he was happy his daughter was found. “I’m happy she’s back home and she’s alive,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said on Thursday the Ilembe cluster task team, Sundumbili detectives and personnel of a security company went to Malutho, Matatiele, near the Lesotho border, where they rescued the girl and arrested a 41-year-old woman. Mbele said the grade one pupil was kidnapped at 10.15am on 13 November while playing with her friends at school by a woman who pretended to be her aunt. “When the woman didn’t get permission from the school to take the child to go and buy clothes, she waited outside until she saw her playing. She abducted her and took a taxi to Matatiele,” said Mbele. The teachers called her mum, who said she didn’t know the woman. The matter was reported to the Sundumbili cops. “On Thursday, police acted on information the woman was on her way to Durban. The woman was caught at the taxi rank without the child. She took them back to Matatiele, where the child was found with the woman’s grandma. The child was rescued and taken to hospital for check-ups,” said Mbele. The woman was charged with kidnapping and will appear in the Nyoni Magistrates Court today. KZN provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula said: “The child will get counselling from social workers, which I believe will help her deal with the ordeal.”
