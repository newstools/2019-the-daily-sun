SHE was about to celebrate her second wedding anniversary when she was involved in a car crash on Friday. Now Sophie Lichaba, who was fondly known as Queen Moroka on SABC1 soapie Generations, is thanking God for sparing her life. Sophie took to Instagram on Saturday to praise God and slam the devil, whom she said has tried everything to ruin her life and marriage! THE LICHABA'S CELEBRATE 2 YEARS OF MARRIAGE Sophie was travelling alone from Gauteng to visit her family in Welkom, Free State, when she collided with an Isuzu bakkie. According to 1Life911 emergency medical services, the actress was taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for minor injuries. She was driving her silver Maserati Grandturismo convertible sports car. On her Instagram, Sophie wrote: “Today we celebrate two years anniversary of our marriage. God is amazing. The devil tried everything! PICS: KHUNE'S MAKOTI! “Today I’m alive. I’m thanking you Lord that we have survived it all through your mercy, even the continuous attacks on our marriage because the human devils just won’t stop and don’t give up.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “A case of reckless and negligent driving is being investigated.” When called for comment, Sophie asked Daily Sun to send her an SMS with the questions and said she’d respond. But she hadn’t responded to SMSes or calls at the time of going to print.
