The South African National Editors' Forum (Sanef) says it
has approached Parliament's Ethics Committee to hold Mineral Resources Minister
Gwede Mantashe accountable for his bribery claims.  The editors' forum said in a statement on Wednesday that it
had written to the committee, asking it to hold a hearing into the matter.  Sanef said it noted that, to date, Mantashe had not
apologised for his comments on bribing journalists at Sunday World newspaper.  In October, the Sunday World newspaper published a response
from Mantashe, claiming that he had declined to answer their questions about a
love triangle story involving him, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Lerato
Habiba Makgatho.  The newspaper reported that Mantashe said he had paid R70
000 to two of the newspaper's journalists to not publish the story.  However, he refused to name them and said the publication
could go ahead and write the story as that was his comment.  After meeting with Sunday World editor Makudu Sefara and
Sanef, Mantashe admitted that he had told the newspaper that he bribed their
journalists, but that he had not actually done it.  "This is an extremely serious matter for Sanef, and we
will continue to seek answers,‚Äù Sanef said on Wednesday.  "Finally, Sanef has followed up with members of Judge
[Kathy] Satchwell's independent Media Ethics and Credibility Inquiry,"
Sanef said.  Sanef confirmed that they would be approaching Mantashe to
make a submission at the inquiry.  Sanef said it believed that an apology to the journalist at
Sunday World, the media house, the broader journalism profession and the people
of South Africa was required from Mantashe.  "Sanef reiterates the fact that paid for or so-called
"brown envelope" journalism is a very serious breach of the Press
Council Code.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sanef-calls-on-parliaments-ethics-committee-to-hold-mantashe-to-account-for-journalist-bribe-claims-20191113
