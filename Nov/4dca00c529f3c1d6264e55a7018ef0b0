MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says there is no need to panic after his side played to a goalless draw against struggling Baroka on Wednesday at Peter Mokaba Stadium. The result have left defending Absa Premiership champions and second placed Downs seven points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs. The Tshwane giants travel to Durban to face Golden Arrows in their next league assignment on Sunday at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium (3.3pm). The Brazilians are on 18 points, while the high-flying Amakhosi are on 25 with 10 matches. But Mosimane’s team are one game behind the Soweto giants. Other titles contender Gavin Hunt’s Bidvest Wits are third on the log with 15 points and four games behind Chiefs. “We have to keep going, remember the league is marathon,” Mosimane said. “We are still in the Telkom Knockout Cup, Champions League and the PSL title is still there. We are just little under pressure because of injuries to our important players. But it’s part of the programme. We don’t have to panic. We just have to keep going.” “We are only two points behind in our programme. We have to follow the process and be patient. The outcome will sort itself.” In their clash against Bakgaga, the nine-time PSL champions missed the likes of Themba Zwane, Phakhamani Mahlambi and Gaston Sirino due to injuries. Mosimane also said his side did not deserve the three points against struggling Wedson Nyirenda’s men. “We did not create many easy chances in this game,” said the former SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana head coach. “If I look at our performance, we really don’t deserve the points. I think a point is fair. Baroka played and fought for a point. A point is better than nothing. We will take it.”
