ZAMALEK coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic may be under fire in Egypt. This comes after his side, Zamalek opened their CAF Champions League group-stages with a heavy 3-0 defeat to TP Mazembe in Lubumbashi. Zamalek are placed in group A alongside Angola’s de Agosto, Zambian champions Zesco United, and TP Mazembe of DR Congo.Their first game took place at the Democratic Republic of the Congo against the five-time CAF Champions League winners, and things didn’t go to plan for Sredojevic side. Midweek, before this big clash there were speculatioN that were swelling around Micho’s future in Egypt, following Zamalek’s 2-1 league defeat to ENPPI on Monday. However, the former Orlando Pirates mentor appeared to have the backing of his boss, club president Mortada Mansour. Mazembe got their breakthrough through Jackson Muleka, who in 60th minute converted Patou Kabangu’s inch-perfect cross with a powerful header into Awad’s net. Five minutes later,Mulota Kabangu was released in the right side, before sending a low cross to Trésor Mputu, who easily found the net from inside the penalty area. Zamalek had chances to get one back through Ferjani Sassi and Achraf Bencharki, but both players were wasteful, and the hosts punished them with a third goal in the 84th minute. For the third time, Patou Kabangu sent a cross from the right side, which was met by Jackson Muleka’s header into Awad’s net. Zamalek will now shift their focus to the domestic football as they will host third-divison club El-Sharkia in the Egypt Cup next Wednesday.
