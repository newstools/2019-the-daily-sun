JOZI hair enthusiasts have thrown caution to the wind as they’re gearing up for the upcoming African Hair and Beauty Festival Expo. The event is set to take place at the Nasrec Expo Centre in the new year. It aims to bring an array of influencers in the hair and beauty scene to celebrate the authenticity of African hair. Noluthando Marhwa, who spearheads the event, said the expo will be about celebrating the modern woman as she rocks her hair. Said Noluthando: “These multi-faceted women have careers and families and are passionate about their appearance. They place a high value on looking and feeling their very best. “The festival will, undoubtedly, provide them with an indispensable platform to uncover products created for them that will enable them to face the world with confidence.”
