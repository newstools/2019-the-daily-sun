NTHABELENG Makae wanted to study law so she could fight for women’s rights. But on Saturday, her decomposing body was found after she was allegedly murdered by her ex-boyfriend. The 17-year-old was found in the suspect’s room at Madala Hostel in Randfontein, west of Joburg, after residents noticed flies and a terrible smell coming from the room. Her mum, Ntombikayise, told Daily Sun her daughter died a painful death and was left to rot like an animal.  The 44-year-old from Mohlakeng said: “She had stab wounds and acid was poured on her body. I couldn’t even recognise her.” Ntombikayise said the person who did this to Nthabeleng deserved the harshest punishment on earth. “My daughter had big dreams. She wanted to turn the family’s situation around, but that will never happen. She was in matric writing her final exams and had been accepted to university,” she said.  Ntombikayise said Nthabeleng worked hard at home and at school. “She knew what she wanted.” Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said a 25-year-old man was taken in for questioning.  “When police arrived at the hostel, a resident pointed out the room. Upon entering, cops found a woman’s body in a decomposing state covered in a blanket. An inquest docket has been opened, pending confirmation of the cause of death,” she said.
