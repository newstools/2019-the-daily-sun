Rugby World Cup winners the Springboks will begin their
five-day trophy parade on Thursday, starting in the capital city, Pretoria, on
Thursday and ending off in the Mother City, Cape Town, on Monday. And you can catch a glimpse of the country's heroes if you
can make it to one of these five cities. The Boks, now the world's best team after convincingly
beating England 32-12 in the final on Saturday, are expected to arrive on a
number of flights from Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday. Coach Rassie Erasmus, captain Siya Kolisi and vice-captain
Handre Pollard will be among those who arrive on Tuesday, with SA Rugby saying
that their arrival time had been moved to 19:00 due to technical difficulties
in Sydney. There were tears, cheers and dancing as South Africans at
home and around the world celebrated the Springboks victory over England in the
finals of the Rugby World Cup in Japan on Saturday. The Boks not only arrive with the Web Ellis Cup, but with
the bragging rights of being named World Rugby's Team of the Year; Erasmus as
Coach of the Year and flank Pieter-Steph du Toit as Player of the Year. After the game on Saturday, Kolisi dedicated the win to the
many South Africans who had supported the squad. Indeed, even throughout the
tournament, both coach and captain made it a point to always acknowledge the
support back home. Now, South Africans will have a chance to see the Boks during
