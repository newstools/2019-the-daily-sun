  After legendary musician and actress mama Abigail Kubheka was
assaulted by a taxi driver, women stood up to support her. They condemned the incident and called for men to stop
abusing women but, start respecting them. They then met with mama Abigail in Orlando East to give her
their best wishes. The women presented mama Abigail with flowers and gave her
words of support and encouragement. Function organiser Thoba Mavimbela told the SunTeam that the
way mama Abigail was treated by the taxi driver was not right at all. “Mama Abigail is a grown woman, that taxi driver should have
treated her with respect,” she said. She said they went to cheer her up and ease her. At the time of publication Mama Abigail had not been found
for comment. Her phone rang to voicemail. However, in a video taken during the event, Mama Abigail
thanked the women for coming and said she loved them. “Thanks for coming out for me, for encouraging me and for
the gifts that you gave me,” she said. The musician was assaulted by a taxi driver three weeks ago
shortly after an accident. That after she found herself in the middle of a road rage
incident with the taxi driver in Orlando East, Soweto. The taxi driver fled the scene after the incident and the
cops were looking for him. It was reported that the angry driver attacked mama Abigail
during an argument after a crash involving her car and the taxi. She was left with a visible black eye and swollen lips. Gauteng cops spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said
cops were investigating a case of common assault. This is what other women had to say about the event on
social media. Nobathembu said: “This is what women should do to all
victims of gender violence. It shouldn’t only be done to those that are famous,
but to all women that are victim.” Lihle said: “Surely if we can stand together like this as
women, we can win this fight.” Londiwe said: “When will men start respecting us.”
