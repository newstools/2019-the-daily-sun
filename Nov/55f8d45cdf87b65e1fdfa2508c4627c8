SIHLE Ndlovu (39) bought a house so he could have his entire family under one roof. But his family has split because they run the risk of being swallowed by a sea of kak.  He said: “I have been forced to let my baby mama and kids go and live with relatives because the smell is unbearable and could make them sick.” Sihle said they were only happy for a few months after buying the house in Ezakheni B section in Ladysmith, northern KZN. He said at first there was a bad smell coming from the toilet, but it flooded and kak started coming out of the bowl. “I suspect there is a blockage in a sewerage pipe that forces kak to push down to my pipe because I am the last house near the sewage drain.” READ: WAR OVER IDOLS TWINS! He said this has been going on for almost 10 months. Sihle said he reported the matter to uThukela District Municipality many times and they came but couldn’t fix the problem. “I have to save money to fix the problem so I can have my family back.” Sihle said he has even moved all his furniture out of the house. “I eat after work before coming home. The smell is too much.” He said kids in the area play in the sewage water which is a health risk. Municipality spokesman Jabulani Mkhonza said many municipalities were experiencing similar problems because people stole property such as manhole covers. However, the municipality has put in a requisition for a machine which would assist to unblock the system much quicker.
