GOING to the supermarket to buy groceries was a short walk. But residents are now suffering and are being inconvenienced. They have had to pay for a taxi from Samora Machel to Nyanga, Philippi and the Promenade Mall in Cape Town. Two months ago, Samora residents protesting over service delivery burnt the only supermarket in the area. Avanza driver Nkosinathi Madikizela (37) said they used to struggle as not that many people went outside Samora. “What happened was terrible. But I won’t lie . We’re benefitting from what happened.  We know we’ll get passengers,” said Madikizela. Mandla Nazela told the People’s Paper:  “Now we come here every day because we know we’re not wasting petrol. “We know the supermarket will be rebuilt and this will end, but in the meantime we’re enjoying this.” Resident Zimasa Khumalo (38) told Daily Sun that the residents were paying a heavy price for what had happened during the protest. “I hope this is a lesson for the people who take advantage when communities protest,” said Zimasa. “Burning what we have will never be the solution. “Most people in Samora are unemployed.  They use their grant money for transport.”
