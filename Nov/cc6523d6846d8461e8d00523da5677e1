ALL Welcome Maseko wanted was his rent from a shop owner. But instead, he got his hand brutally chopped off. The 65-year-old from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, was left lying in a hospital bed in terrible pain. His wife, Busisiwe (53), told Daily Sun Welcome had been renting a shop to a Pakistani for R3 500 a month, but the man often skipped payments. “He skipped two months’ rent and Welcome wanted that money. Instead of paying, he became violent and butchered my husband with a panga. We saw his hand lying on the ground. It was very traumatising,” she said. Busisiwe said on Friday, Welcome locked the shop and demanded his rent money. “But the shopkeeper jumped the fence and went to fetch a panga,” she said. Welcome’s nephew, Thabo (45) said the panga landed on his uncle’s hand while he was trying to shield his head. “We had been telling malume to chase this man away because he was trouble, but he thought he would change. Malume nearly paid with his life. “We tried to catch him after what he did, but he ran away. We don’t know where he went.” Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said a case of attempted murder was opened and police were looking for the suspect.
