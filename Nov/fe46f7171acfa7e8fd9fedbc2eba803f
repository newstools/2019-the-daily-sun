Those arrested include six men and one woman. "Police retrieved some of the stolen property and they are searching for more," said Rwexana. Police detectives also embarked on a door-to-door search in the area to recover some of the looted items. It is believed the trucks were caught in the middle of a community protest in the area, but Breede Valley Municipality mayoral committee member for safety and security, Juben von Willingh, told News24 that they were not sure why the protest action was taking place. "No one has come forward with demands," Von Willingh told News24 on Thursday. One of the trucks belonged to the Buonadonna Group, who spoke to News24 on Thursday saying their truck had been stripped bare: "They took everything. All the smart televisions, and they also started vandalising the truck," said Amica Buonadonna. Batteries were stripped, so too were fuse boxes, cameras and electronics. Source: News24
