Majola from Newtown A, north of Durban is a woman who lives with HIV. The
37-year-old mother of one child said she discovered about her status in 2004. Speaking to
the Daily Sun at G section KwaMashu north of Durban she said she
discovered that she was HIV positive at the age of 22 and at that time she was
pregnant with her 14-year-old daughter. The bubbly
woman said when she discovered her status, she was upset but because she got
support from her family she accepted and learnt to live with it. "Now
it's been 15 years that I've been living with HIV. I live a healthy life and
I'm working on achieving my dreams," she said. She said
she takes her medication, and everything is going well for her. "World
Aids Day is a reminder of people who died of HIV and Aids back then. People
died because they didn’t take treatment," she said. She said
but now people are no longer dying. "Nowadays
people are not dying because we are lucky to get treatment there and then. Now
there are less people dying of Aids. Being HIV positive is no longer something
to be ashamed of," she said. She said
her advice to people living with HIV is that they should know that being HIV
positive is not the end of the world, as she is a living testimony. She said
they can still live a healthy life and be happy like HIV negative. "And
people should speak out about it so that they can get support," she said. She’s currently
working for the Aids Foundation South Africa a field worker. "We
visit young women. Those that are negative I help them to keep their negative
status and those that are positive I encourage them to live a healthy
lifestyle," she said.
