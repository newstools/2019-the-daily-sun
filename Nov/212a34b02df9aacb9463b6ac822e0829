RARELY do Bafana Bafana have such a tight schedule for qualifying matches. As if travelling to Ghana is not daunting enough, Molefi Ntseki’s team has to assemble for camp in Cape Coast just two days before they open their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at Cape Coast stadium on Thursday. Two days later, they will be back in Joburg to prepare for the second qualifier, against Sudan at Orlando Stadium on Sunday. This makes for a gruelling task for the Bafana coach, going into his first competitive match since taking over from Stuart Baxter. “A win will give us a good start. But a point away will also be a good result,” said Ntseki. “Four points from the two matches will put us in a good position in this group. We have a team capable of getting results. I’m of the belief that if you prepare well you will have less repairing moments during the game. And if you have less repairing moments it means the players will be executing the plan. When luck becomes part of that plan you will be winning matches. “We are not concerned with the situation with the Ghana team. We regard them as strong opposition and expect a tough match.” Ntseki is expecting his overseas-based players, including Percy Tau, Lebohang Phiri, Thulani Serero, Kamohelo Mokotjo and Lebo Mothiba to fly directly to Accra. Ntseki has had a promising start to his tenure, guiding Bafana to a 2-1 win over Mali in the Nelson Mandela Challenge. But his real challenge starts on Thursday, having to prove he has completed his apprenticeship with the junior national teams. He still has to assert his credentials to prove he is the right choice and not a “cheaper option” as skeptics have purported.
