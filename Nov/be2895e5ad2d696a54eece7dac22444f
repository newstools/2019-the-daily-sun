DJ CNDO has been accused of not arriving at an event and now the organiser wants his R3 000 deposit back. The DJ, whose real name is Sindisiwe Zungu, was apparently supposed to perform at the Call It Spring Festival in Ixopo, KZN, two months ago. According to event organiser Andile Caluza, the Durban-based DJ charged him R8 000. “I paid R3 000 deposit and the rest was supposed to be paid after the performance. I was surprised and disappointed when she didn’t arrive. I contacted her and she kept saying she was coming,” he said. “Later it became clear she wasn’t coming. She didn’t even bother to apologise for her non-arrival. I had to explain to fans. “I’m now left with no choice but to demand my money back from her. If she fails to refund me, I’ll have to seek other ways of getting my money from her,” he said. Andile told Daily Sun it was the first big event he organised and he was worried the experience would have a negative impact on his image. “I had been communicating with her team and everything seemed to be fine. I even have proof of payment,” he said. “I was told I won’t get my money back because her face appeared on the event poster. This has left me confused.” When the SunTeam contacted Cndo, she said she didn’t remember the event. “I’m doing a lot of events and I can’t remember this one. “I’ll have to check my diary,” she said before hanging up. When she was contacted later, she didn’t answer. She failed to respond to the SunTeam for over a week.
