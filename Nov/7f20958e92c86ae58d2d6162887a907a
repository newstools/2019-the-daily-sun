HEALTH and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa have expressed concern following the rape of a nurse in a hospital. The incident happened at Nkonjeneni Hospital in Mahlabathini, northern KZN, on Sunday. The unknown man allegedly entered the hospital at about 5pm, pretending to be seeking medical attention. He allegedly proceeded to a consulting room, where he overpowered the nurse and raped her. The union’s chairman in the province, Thamsanqa Zondi, said nurses at the hospital found it difficult to work in an unsafe environment. “The nurses haven’t been assured of their safety, which we find painful and worrying,” he said. Zondi said they believed the incident happened because there’s a shortage of staff in public healthcare facilities. He said they learnt the victim was alone at the time of the incident. Zondi also raised concerns about poor security at the hospital. “The lights don’t work in some parts of the hospital. This shouldn’t happen because it works to the thugs’ advantage,” said Zondi. KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu demanded answers from hospital management and the contracted security company. She said the nurse received emergency medical attention and arrangements were made for her to be seen by a psychologist. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said according to the nurse, the suspect raped her at knife point before fleeing the scene on foot. “A case of rape was opened at Mahlabathini cop shop,” said Gwala.
