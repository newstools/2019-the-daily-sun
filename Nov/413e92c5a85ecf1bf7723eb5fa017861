THE three Absa Premiership points sucked out of Mamelodi Sundowns are more precious for Golden Arrows like the Webb Ellis trophy is to South Africans, after the Springboks won the Rugby World Cup. In fact, according to the Arrows coach Steve Komphela, the points are classed “beyond platinum” following a rare 3-2 win over the nine-time PSL champions at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Sunday. This win not only maintained Arrows’ unbeaten run at home this season, but has also seen them jump to fourth place on the log with 17 points from 11 games – equal with third-placed SuperSport United, and one behind second-placed Sundowns. Their win was achieved under trying conditions after it rained throughout the day in Durban, leaving the pitch unplayable. “If Arrows can win under these conditions, what more do you want...?” said Komphela. “They were very crucial three points for us. And listen, a point in the PSL is golden, and this is beyond platinum. “Three points against Mamelodi Sundowns... and coach Pitso Mosimane is fighting tooth and nail to get points, it was a good application from the team.” What makes Komphela very proud also is that his boys came from behind to win all the three points. Danny Phiri cancelled Thapelo Morena’s opener after a howler by Downs goalie Denis Onyango, then Knox Mutizwa stole the show by netting two goals to make it 3-1. That was before Andile Jali pounced from nowhere to make the scoreline respectable for the visitors in the 88th minute. This was Arrows’ first win over Sundowns in the league match since 2015-16 season. It now remains to be seen whether Arrows will repeat the same performance when the two sides meet again in a Telkom Knockout semi-final at the same venue on 22 November.
