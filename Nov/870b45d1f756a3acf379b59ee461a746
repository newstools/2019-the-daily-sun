MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has urged his players to stay focused on their own targets and not to get concerned by Kaizer Chiefs' Absa Premiership lead. Chiefs have opened up a 10-point lead over second-placed Sundowns following their 3-2 Soweto derby win over Orlando Pirates at the weekend, but Mosimane doesn't want his players to focus on the widening gap. "No, if you focus on other people you are losing the plot. You need to focus on yourself. We know how we win the league," Mosimane said. "We've won the league four times in the last six years, two times we came second, this is not new to us. What we need to focus on is Sundowns. "At this point in time, we are five points behind our programme. If anybody has got more than five to us good luck to that person, that means they've done very well. "So, you can't be looking at your neighbour that he's got a new car now you want a new car, you've got to focus on yourself. "You can talk about ten points, but we are five points behind in our programme and we get that programme when we get to 75 points. We want 72 in total, so we are running our own race." The Brazilians have lost two of their last three Premiership games, including a 2-0 defeat to Chiefs. Golden Arrows edged them out 3-2 on Sunday following a goalless draw at Baroka. When the Premiership resumes Sundowns will take face AmaZulu on November 26. -TeamTalk
