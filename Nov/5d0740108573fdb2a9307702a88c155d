THERE should finally be sunshine in northern KZN after the storms and two tornadoes that rocked the region. The first tornado on Friday left several houses in Utrecht damaged, followed by a second one in KwaCeza and Edlebe villages in Ulundi on Saturday. Weather forecaster Mkhushulwa Msimang said the tornado in Ulundi followed severe storms which began on Thursday and lasted throughout the weekend. Msimang said residents should expect clear skies today.  Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka sent disaster management teams to Ulundi. He said the South African Weather Service had confirmed that a violent storm and what looked like a tornado ripped through parts of Ulundi, according to their radar system. “We’ve taken the decision to send our teams to the area, but no damages or injuries were reported,” said Hlomuka.  “Our teams are stretched thin on the ground as we continue to respond to incidents that have caused problems in parts of the province.” Sithembiso Dube (38) from KwaCeza said they buried a family member during the storm. He said they had hoped the storm would pass, but while they were busy with the burial the rain started pouring down. “We’re happy no one has died,” he said. Sithembiso said they hoped the storm would end so they could do their washing.
