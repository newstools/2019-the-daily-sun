Usually when people see money requests from celebrities,
they think it’s a scam. Recently Zola 7, real name Bonginkosi Dlamini requested his
fans to help him raise funds. Many people thought it wasn’t him, but Zola 7 confirmed that
it was him. He said he wanted to raise funds close or more than R5
million. He said he was doing all this to help the needy. However, Zola told Daily Sun that it not only money
he was interested in. The number one guluva as he is affectionately known, said
that all kind of donations are welcome. This come after there were many calls on social media to
have him back on the helping desk. Bonginkosi’s show Zola 7 used to air on SABC 1 many years
ago. The programme was about reaching out to the nation, making
people’s dreams come true and inspiring viewers to dream big. Each week Zola would help someone achieve a dream or
overcome a challenge that will change their life. On his Instagram account, Zola posted a video with the
account details where people can pledge. “It’s not a prank or a joke. I need about R5 million to go
and a couple of charities,” he said. Zola told Daily Sun that nothing will stand on his way for
helping people. “Tv or no tv I’m going continuing. I will do what I was born
to do, which is helping people,” he said. “We do not need tv to do things. We have social media now
and the audience reach of social media is huge,” he said. He said that he had all the necessary equipment to have the
program running. “I have cameras and the fleet. All we need are donations to
take to the needy then shoot the whole scene for a formal show to be aired,” he
said. He said that TV was limited in many things. “With Tv, you can’t go international but with social media,
the sky is the limit,” he said. He said that he wanted to reach audience as far as the US.
