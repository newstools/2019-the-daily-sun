AFRIKAANS lobby group AfriForum has announced it will assist with the Senzo Meyiwa murder case after being approached by the family. It announced that Advocate Gerrie Nel, the head of its private prosecution unit, had been appointed as the family’s advocate. The announcement was made by its CEO, Kallie Kriel, with Meyiwa’s brothers Siyabonga and Sifiso Meyiwa at their offices in Tshwane yesterday.  The former goalkeeper and captain of Bafana Bafana was fatally shot in a house in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, five years ago at the age of 27. He was killed in an alleged botched robbery in the presence of his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo, her mum Ntombi, her sister Zandi, Zandi’s boyfriend Longwe Twala as well as his friends Mthokozisi Twala and Tumelo Madlala, and a four-year-old child. No prosecution has yet been instituted by the NPA. READ: I CAN’T BATH IN FRONT OF MY SON! Siyabonga said he was happy and proud to be associated with AfriForum as it was willing to fight for the truth. He said he wouldn’t die before the death of his brother was sorted out. “I do not fear anyone. I only fear God,” he said. “We are calling on all reasonable South Africans of all races to stand with us and oppose this injustice,” he said. Kriel said they wanted to fight for justice by ensuring the NPA did its job. He said it was important for all South Africans to be able to trust the legal system. “We can’t promise we’ll solve this but we’ll do our very best to see justice is done.”
