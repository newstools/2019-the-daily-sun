South African celebrities Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, DJ Tira and David Kau, stepped out on Tuesday, to support Charlize Theron at her Africa Outreach fundraiser in New York. READ: CHARLIZE THERON REMEMBERS HER SA MODELLING DAYS It was the annual fundraiser for The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) which invests in African youth and their ability to keep themselves safe from HIV/AIDS. Charlize created CTAOP in 2007 with the hope of making a difference in fighting HIV in South Africa. Aside, from the familiar local faces, the Oscar-winning actress was also joined by celebrity friends like Amy Schumer, Drew Barrymore, and Awkwafina. Charlize took to social media to send an appreciation shout to her friends for the support. So much love for these amazing ladies who came out to support @ctaop last night at our annual fundraiser. And special thank you to @awkwafina for absolutely killing it as our emcee. Girl, I am truly obsessed with you and if you think I’m kidding when I say I’m moving in, just wait till I show up at your door next Tuesday ??????
