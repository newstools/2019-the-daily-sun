Fifteen people were left injured this morning after a horrific accident. This happened after a taxi and two bakkies collided with a truck and trailer on the N3 in the Camperdown area.  ER24 spokesman, Ross Campbell told Daily Sun that the ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene at approximately 5:40 am and found the truck and trailer completely blocking the freeway and people walking around the scene in the misty weather. “Most of the patients were travelling in the taxi to a running event. One moderately injured adult female was treated with Advanced Life Support interventions before being taken to Edendale Hospital for further care. A child and his father and three other patients who had suffered minor injuries were taken to Northdale Hospital and Mediclinic Pietermaritzburg by ER24,”said Campbell.  Campbell also said nine other patients were treated and transported by other emergency services to provincial hospitals in the area.
