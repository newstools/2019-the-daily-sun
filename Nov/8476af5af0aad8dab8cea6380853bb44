FOLLOWING their dramatic joint exit last month, the Qwabe twins will not be taking part in this Sunday’s finale of Idols SA. Traditionally, the top 12 contestants reappear for the final where the winner is selected between the last two contested. Sowetan reports that Viggy and Virginia declined an invite to the final show in Pretoria. The paper quotes their dad Lawrence Qwabe who said the decision for his daughters to skip the finale was taken by them as a family and by his daughter’s fans. Mzansi Magic also confirms to the paper that the Qwabe will skip the finale.  The SunTeam has been following the drama since three weeks ago when Virginia was eliminated from the top 12. Her twin Viggy was left but decided to quit in support of her twin sister. Since then, the twins have been hanging out with DJ Tira. But last week the SunTeam reported that there were tensions following Tira’s interest in the twins. Their manager, Kim Coppen, said Viggy and Virginia had three contracts with Gallo Records, Idols SA and Think Entertainment.  The Gallo contract is responsible for all their recording deals, Think Entertainment handles management including their appearances, dealings and bookings, while the Idols SA contract is for their participation in the show and agreement that they would comply with its rules and regulations. Coppen told Daily Sun that according to their contract, the twins could not make public appearances or be booked without her knowledge. This would be in breach of contract.
