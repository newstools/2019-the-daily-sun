As the world prepares to raise awareness
of the Aids pandemic on Sunday, Lowveld walkers in Mbombela painted the streets
of Mbombela red and white in memory those who died of HIV/AIDS. The group walked holding burning
candles, singing and praying.  Mongezi Khumalo a first time participant
told Daily Sun that he is here to support those infected and affected by the
disease. "I have seen my friends and family
members living with the disease losing hope. I am here in support of them and
to also pray for them," he said Meanwhile Mzamo Mogale said those who
have HIV already must know that it's not the end life. "People must take
medication, continue to live a normal life and never give. Being HIV positive
doesn't mean that you should stop living, follow your dreams and stop committing
suicide.” Mogale said it is time the youth get one
partner. “Get one partner whom you can trust, get tested on regular basis and
use a condom," he said Last week Saturday, Deputy President David
Mabuza revealed that just over 838 000 people tested positive for HIV for the
period from January to December 2018. He said this during the SANAC plenary
meeting in Secunda. The highest incidence rate were recorded
in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Eastern Cape. The province of Mpumalanga is
sitting with 76,007 of new HIV-positive cases.
