 Max's Lifestyle owner Max Mqadi is proudly uneducated and doesn't regret dropping out of school. Mqadi kept the audience on stitches when he delivered his vote of thanks at the official opening of his refurbished lounge in Umlazi south of Durban. He said he was uneducated and was not regretting anything because he dropped because he didn't want the system that was brought by colonizers. As Somizi Mhlongo who was the programmes director called him up on the stage he said: "Can you address in proper Somizi English."  Mqadi said white men brought education in Mzansi because they wanted black people to work for them and he didn't want to be part of that. "Much has been said about me being uneducated, so what?... Angehlulwanga yisikole yimina owahlula sona. (the school had no problem with me, but I had a problem with the school)," said Mqadi.  He said he left school at grade 11 and started selling fruits in trains and started his tuck-shop. The rest is history as he now owns one of his best restaurants in the world.  The keynote address was delivered by Orlando Pirates and PSL chairman Irvin Khoza who said he was proud of Max's achievement despite his poor level of education. Khoza said Mqadi is a symbol of inspiration to other uneducated people. He congratulated him for his best entertainment lounge in a township. The guest list included premier Sihle Zikalala, mayor Mxolisi Kaunda, former president Jacob Zuma's wife Thobeka Madiba and Shaun Mpisane.
