IT’S a photo which has circulated widely on social media. A cashier from Pick n Pay had her photo taken unknowingly and many made fun of her eyebrows. Jokes about the eyebrows of supermarket cashiers are so common but one forgets that these are everyday women of Mzansi who are just making a living. One Joburg based beauty therapist decided to intervene in what she describes as cyberbullying of the cashier. She tracked down the lady and gave her a professional eyebrow treatment and shaping for free. Speaking to W24, Moipone ‘Mooi’ Mokhali from Fourways said she wanted to offer micro-blading and eyelash extension services for free to the Honey Junction Pick n Pay staff member "I usually see posts where people make fun of eyebrows, so I did not like that she was sabotaged like that. The customer took her picture without her knowing. That was bullying," said Moipone. "I thought to myself, 'I’m going to do something about this'. I put up a post on my Facebook, saying I’m looking for this lady who has become a meme. She further told W24 that when she did find the woman, she took up her offer. Moipone said her special client was very happy with the results of her new permanent brows as well as her eyelash extensions. - W24
