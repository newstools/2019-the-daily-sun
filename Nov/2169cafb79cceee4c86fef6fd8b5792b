Park
Station in Johannesburg was attacked on Tuesday afternoon when groups of people
stormed it and damaged property. According
to Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) spokesperson Nana Zenani, the
incident took place at around lunchtime. Zenani
blamed criminals for being behind the attack. She said
a group of people had targeted specific areas. Shops,
cars, ticket booth windows, access gates and a train were damaged during the
attack. Zenani
said she could not connect the attacks at the station with the recent decision
by Prasa to terminate the contracts of 20 private security companies. She added
the rail agency had a good relationship with labour unions, saying she does not
want to blame their members without any evidence. "According
to security personnel stationed at Park Station, a number of criminals forcibly
entered the station attacking and looting some of the shops, breaking glass
access gates, ticket booth windows and cars. More alarming, however, was the
stoning of one of the train sets resulting in a broken windows. "Fortunately,
no one was injured at the time and we are thankful for that. Our security
guards were on duty when the criminals entered the premises. It was a surprise
attack and I can't say that our guards were overpowered. There was no
confrontation between our guards and the group of criminals," said Zenani. She added
the station had been secured and police officers were on the scene combing the
area, and viewing CCTV footages to identify the attackers. Zenani
said the situation was calm and trains were running on schedule. She has
appealed to commuters to continue using the trains. Zenani
asked people with information about the attack to contact the police as soon as
possible.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/pics-prasa-blames-criminals-for-being-behind-vandalism-at-park-station-20191119
