BLACK fishermen and women in the Eastern Cape can now fish without fear of being bust. On Saturday, Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Barbara Creecy handed out fishing permits to 20 co-operatives at the packed Lilian Ngoyi Community Sports Centre in Kwazakhele, Port Elizabeth.  “President Cyril Ramaphosa promised that the people must receive a share of the economy. We’ve come here to give you the right to fish in the sea next to where you live,” said Creecy. The minister said the permits were for the co-operatives and individuals had the right to individual permits. She said the permits were valid for 15 years. The permits allow the co-operatives to catch lobster, squid, hake and abalone. The 20 co-operatives have more than 1 000 members. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality head of infrastructure, Andile Lungisa, urged beneficiaries to protect their permits. “The ocean economy is big in the Eastern Cape and local residents should participate in the economy to uplift their lives,” said Lungisa. “It was not an easy journey to arrive at this point. This is not a favour. The country’s economy belongs to you.” Bukelwa Gladile of Qolorha Fishing Cooperative from Centane, said she was glad that their lives would be changed for the better. “We come from a place where there’s too much poverty because there are no industries to create employment,” she told Daily Sun. “These permits will assist us to fish freely in the ocean and sell our catch to shops and individuals. Our kids will benefit from the money because we’ll be able to pay school fees and buy uniforms.”
