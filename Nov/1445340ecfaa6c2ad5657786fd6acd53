LOCAL football could soon see the introduction of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR). But that is if Safa embrace the idea. PSL chairman Irvin Khoza has confirmed the League are ready to implement the system, widely seen as a panacea to the costly refereeing mistakes in Absa Premiership matches. However, the League will need the greenlight from the country's football governing body, who are in charge of the referees. "We are going to have a meeting with Safa a d one of the things we are going to discuss is the introduction of the VAR, " said Khoza. "Without the permission of Safa we can't have the VAR." Local football has been blighted by poor officiating in recent seasons. Weekly football discussions centres around controversial refereeing decisions. Coaches have been charged by the PSL for venting their frustration over poor decision while others have been fired for poor results. And by many accounts, the introduction of VAR is long overdue.
