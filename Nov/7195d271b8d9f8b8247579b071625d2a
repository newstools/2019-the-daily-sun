THE chairman of the Tshwane University of Technology council, Bandile Masuku, told Parliament his council meant no disrespect when it failed to appear last week. Masuku said the council and management genuinely needed time to prepare before appearing before the standing committee on education. “On Tuesday the 12th, the council and management received an invitation to appear before the committee on Tuesday the 19th to respond to requested information. “The timing gave us less than one week to prepare a detailed report,” said Masuku. He said he also had to ask for an extension as he had to attend another committee meeting in his capacity as Gauteng MEC for health. The university was supposed to respond to allegations of corruption, maladministration, nepotism and abuse of authority. But Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande was not impressed with the committee for summoning the university’s management, saying he had already attended to the matter himself. Committee chairman Mohlopi Mapulane said the committee was working with information it got from Nzimande’s department. He said even if issues had been brought to Nzimande’s attention, nothing stopped the committee from interrogating the same issues. “I think in future, let’s communicate better between the department and ourselves about what’s been done so we don’t have to repeat things. “From where we’re sitting, the allegations have been there but we don’t know how they’ve been treated.  It’s the responsibility of this committee through its oversight to probe where we think there is a need to probe,” he said .
