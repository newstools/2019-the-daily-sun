COSATU has decided to work with other labour federations for the sake of workers. President Zingisa Losi said: “It must be noted this is not a new thing. We’ve been embarking on strikes in the past with unions from opposing federations. We encourage our union to work with others on common goals like the exploitation of workers.” She was speaking at Cosatu House in Braamfontein, Joburg, yesterday following a three-day central executive committee meeting. “The committee also took a resolution to fight against retrenchments, demand job creation and campaign to gain control of workers’ pensions. The federation also opposes the privatisation of Eskom and other state-owned enterprises,” she said. General secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said: “Something went wrong with state-owned enterprises. They used to function well. This notion that they’re bad is wrong.” Cosatu leaders condemned management of SAA, SA Express, SABC and Eskom for not involving unions in restructuring plans and for targeting workers. It also expressed unhappiness with the national minimum wage. He said: “We call on the National Minimum Wage Commission to urgently perform its annual review of the national minimum wage. “The commission is required by law to review the minimum wage and to ensure it’s protected from things like inflation. “This increase should be implemented by January and commissioners should resign if they’re unable to do their work. “The minister of employment and labour must intervene to ensure this happens.”
