THE Zondo Commission wants Pietermaritzburg’s Umgungundlovu District Municipality’s financial records going back 10 years. The requested documents cover the period from July 2008 to June last year. These include external auditors’ management reports, a schedule detailing the different matters that make up irregular expenditure as reported in the municipal annual financial statements, details of all payments made and all internal audit reports. The commission also wanted copies of all forensic investigation reports finalised in the specified period that were issued to, or prepared by the municipality. All reports made via the district’s hotline and its top 20 suppliers were also requested. A similar request for reports was also made to the eThekwini Metro. Umgungundlovu has warned the submission of documents was not negotiable,and it was a crime to obstruct the commission from doing its work, and doing so will attract criminal sanction. District manager Ray Ngcobo confirmed yesterday to Daily Sun’s sister paper The Witness the municipality was requested to make the submissions. He said they did not know what it was actually looking for. “Ours is to co-operate and make all the information required available.”
