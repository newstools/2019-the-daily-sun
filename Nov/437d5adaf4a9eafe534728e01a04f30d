 The body of
an unidentified man has been found in the boot of a vehicle used as a getaway
car by suspected supermarket robbers in Uitenhage on Wednesday. According
to a police statement, on Wednesday around 15:30, a group of about four armed
men stormed into a supermarket in Caledon Street, Uitenhage. Employees
and customers were reportedly held at gunpoint, while other suspects stole
money from the tills. The men then fled the scene in a grey Toyota Corolla. Onlookers
flagged down a police patrol vehicle that was driving near the supermarket and
alerted officers about the robbery. Police gave
chase and caught up with a getaway vehicle in Park Lane. When the
men saw the police vehicle, they started shooting and jumped out of the car,
still shooting, police said Other
police units then responded, resulting in the arrest of three men. One of them
was injured during a shootout and was taken to hospital for treatment. Police also
recovered two firearms. While
inspecting the getaway vehicle, the body of a man was found in the boot. Police
say it is unknown whether the dead man had been hijacked and killed in the
crossfire or whether he was working with the suspects. No police
officers were injured during the shootout. The three
men, aged between 24 and 36, are due to appear in the Uitenhage Magistrate's
Court soon on charges ranging from business robbery to attempted murder. An inquest
docket was also opened and is to be investigated by the Independent Police
Investigative Directorate. SOURCE:
