A LITTLE girl was bullied so badly that she’s now struggling to walk. Her mum told Daily Sun the seven-year-old was taken to a heap of burning coal by classmates, two boys and a girl, and made to walk on it. It happened last month in Rietspruit, Mpumalanga. The 27-year-old mum said she didn’t open a case because the child was still recovering in hospital. She said after the incident the girl was spotted by a resident, who took her home. The mum said the parents of the kids involved hadn’t apologise to her family.  “My child’s legs were badly burnt and she can’t walk. The bullies’ parents didn’t even come to say sorry.” Community leader Joseph Nzimande said the hot coal was supposed to have been fenced off by the South 32 Coal Mine, but it wasn’t. “A lot of livestock have disappeared on that mountain of coal. We want the mine to fence the area so everyone can be safe,” he said. Mine spokeswoman Jenny White said a team from the mine organised for the child to go to hospital.  “The company has regular contact with the family and is visiting the child in hospital to ensure she gets the best possible care,” she said. Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said he was aware of the matter and the school was writing a report.
