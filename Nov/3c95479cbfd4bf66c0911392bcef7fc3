 While a new
JMPD accepted a R30 bribe a new days ago, JMPD k9 Unit offers declined a R20
000 bribe. This
happened this morning when a tip off led them to Somali nationals who were
found making fake marriage certificates, fake passports, fake IDs, fake asylum
documents. The JMPD
spokesman, superintendent Wayne Minnaar told Daily Sun that after officers
received a tipoff of their illegal business, they also tried bribe officers
with R20 000. "Fortunately,
these were very dedicated officers of JMPD K9 Unit and arrested the suspects
very quickly," said Minnaar. Minnaar
also warned residents to stop attempting bribery on cops. "We
have devoted officers who've been declining bribes, your misconduct will only
buy you more jail time," he added.
