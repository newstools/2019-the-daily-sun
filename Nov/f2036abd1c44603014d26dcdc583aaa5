The festive season is upon us and we know the stories of cheating that come up in January leave some single but that is not the case for Maria-Louise Warne. Maria-Louise revealed to The Sun that she gives her boyfriend permission to cheat on her during the Christmas period and then he buys her ‘guilty’ gifts. English teacher Maria-Louise Warne, 61, from Bovey Tracey, Devon has been in a relationship with Greg* for the past 10 years and says she's fine with this unorthodox philosophy. "People might think I'm mad but I don't mind my other half being unfaithful at Christmas. I'd also rather know than be made a fool of." she says. "A year into our relationship my partner made it crystal clear to me that fidelity was a meaningless concept to him. According to Greg ‘sex is just an act.’ It is an itch that needs to be scratched." she added. Before meeting her partner she had heard rumours about his sexual appetite, but now just lets him get on with it. "Our sex life is nothing short of amazing. If he wants to have sex elsewhere once in a while then I won’t stop him.I am not saying I condone it or encourage it. But to some men it's like having a drive in a different type of car." Warne told the Fabulous Digital team. Dr. Wednesday Martin says long-term relationships are harder on female desire than their male counterpart and a man should give his wife something she really wants this Christmas.
