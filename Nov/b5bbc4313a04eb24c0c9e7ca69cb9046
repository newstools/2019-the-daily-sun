MZANSI is about to embark on a reading revolution spearheaded by renowned social entrepreneur and chartered accountant Sizwe Nxasana. He’s the founder and chairman of the National Education Collaboration Trust, which has been tasked with driving the National Reading Plan. STAY NAKED...READ! On top of the list is getting the young ones to read for meaning. Nxasana sat down with us to share how he planned to lead this revolution in the latest episode of Under the Umbrella. He shared with us how this could be achieved, how the current system was not working and how it could be fixed. An educationist, Nxasana revealed why he supported the recently proposed grade 9 school leaving certificate and how it could benefit the school leavers. In the age of the fourth industrial revolution, he highlighted how this could be used to the pupils’ advantage. He also shared what could be best described as the nation’s frustration until the lack of our own stories to read in our own mother tongues. The ill-discipline of teachers and the cooperation of unions were some of the issues he shared.
