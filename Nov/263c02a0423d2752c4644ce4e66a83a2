MAMELODI Sundowns continue to lose ground on title rivals Kaizer Chiefs as their rather poor run of form of late continues. They were stunned 3-2 by an impressive Golden Arrows outfit in tough rainy conditions at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Sunday. They came into the clash ten points adrift of leaders Chiefs and under pressure to close the gap. But Arrows were having none of that - putting on an impressive display to halt Pitso Mosimane's outfit. The result means the gap stays the same and Downs now have it all to do to catch up to Amakhosi. They got off to a good start against Arrows, taking the lead just before half-time through speedstar Thapelo Morena. The Bafana Bafana international tapped in Tebogo Langerman’s cross to put his side ahead in the 41st minute. But a mistake by the usually solid Dennis Onyango in the Downs goal, allowed Arrows a way back into the match. He fumbled Danny Phiri’s shot in the 61st minute and the scores were even. That was all the luck Arrows needed as they roared back to take the lead through their marksman Knox Mutizwa’s powerful strike. The Zimbabwean was not done there, he was back to inflict more pain when he fired home the third from the spot. Downs made it a tense encounter when Andile Jali scored in the 88th minute, but they could not get the all-important equaliser. The two sides will resume their battle in the Telkom Knockout semi-finals on the 23rd of November at the same venue.
