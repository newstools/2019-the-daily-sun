The People’s Paper sat down with Kriben Reddy, TransUnion Africa’s Head of Auto Information Solutions to talk about blacklisting and credit scores. TransUnion the company provides their clients with the information they need to make good choices and apply effective business strategies. WHAT IS BLACKLISTING?  In the video above, Reddy explains that “blacklisting” is an old term that was around when credit scores reflected only negative information to people who are deciding whether to lend you money. Nowadays, the power is with you to build a positive credit score by managing your finances responsibly. UNDERSTANDING YOUR CREDIT SCORE  Reddy explains that a credit score is essentially a summary of your credit behavior, ie what money have you borrowed and are you paying it back as agreed. The full credit report gives a lot of detail on which accounts you own and how good you are at paying your bills. Companies then use this report to decide if they can loan you money and at what interest rate. The higher your risk profile, the higher your interest rate. DO CREDIT SCORES HAVE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES? All credit bureaus would have their own ratings or category sets. At TransUnion, scores range between 0 and 999, with a score of 760 and above putting you into an “excellent” category, explains Reddy.  COMING SOON: HOW TO FIX YOUR CREDIT SCORE!
