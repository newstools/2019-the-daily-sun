A tip-off has led the police to uncover
abalone worth millions of rands at a farm. The two-day operation which began on
Monday led to seven suspects being arrested in Hekpoort in the West Rand. According to the police, members of the
West Rand Flying Squad received a tip-off about a suspicious truck from Cape
Town to Hekpoort which is loaded with abalone. The truck, said the police, would then
transport the processed abalone to Mozambique.  “On arrival at the farm, police found
what appears to be an illegal processing and packaging plant where both raw and
processed abalone was found, estimated at around R4 million pending
confirmation by experts. “In the building, police also found
equipment and chemicals suspected to be used during the processing and
packaging of the abalone,” said police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters. Peters said amongst the suspects
arrested is the owner of the farm and a woman.  “Police also recovered two illegal
firearms with ammunition,- one of the firearms has already been confirmed as
reported stolen in Klerksdorp, while the second firearm had the serial number
filed off. An undisclosed amount of cash has also been seized for further
investigation,” said Peters. The suspects are facing charges of
illegal possession and dealing in abalone, as well as possession of unlicensed
firearms and ammunition. Gauteng Provincial Commissioner,
Lieutenant General Elias Mawela said: "Our Crime Intelligence plays a very
big part in the fight against crime and we appreciate that they are behind most
of the successful safer festive season operations that are underway in the
Province," he said.
