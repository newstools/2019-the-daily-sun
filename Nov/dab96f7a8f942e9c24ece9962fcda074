KAMOGELO Ngatane (19) was looking forward to enjoying his lunch at school but he got his face smashed with a brick instead! “I had money on me but the thugs were only interested in my polony sandwiches,” said Kamogelo from Bochabela in Mangaung, a grade 11 pupil at Calculus College in Bloemfontein. Two thugs stopped him on Wednesday. They then searched and hit him with a brick and took his food.  Kamogelo was going to write his tourism exam paper. “I don’t usually use that road, but there were many people walking to work so I thought I was safe. I had my earphones on. Two thugs carrying bricks attacked me. I pleaded with them to take my R10 but they said they wanted my polony and smashed my face,” said Kamogelo. “I screamed for help but no one came. My face was covered in blood and I decided to go home. My mother took me to hospital for treatment. I am not going to open a case because I want to focus on my exams.” READ: PASTOR TURNS TO WINE! “I hope they choke on my sandwich.” Kamogelo’s mother Nono Natane (46) said: “When my son came home with a bloody face I thought he was in an accident. I took him to hospital immediately.” She said polony was a once a month treat. “He can’t identify the thugs who did this to him but I hope the incident doesn’t affect his exams.”
