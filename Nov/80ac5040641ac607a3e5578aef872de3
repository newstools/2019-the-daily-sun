The Premier Youth Football tournament, commonly known as the “Youth Cup”, started as a local youth tournament initiative, established by AFC, which was founded in 2002. The AFC team is currently former Platinum Stars and Free State Stars midfielder Coldrin Coetzee, a CAF/SAFA D-Level Coaching License holder. Boosting a successful history, the Youth Cup has since evolved from various formats, starting as invitational, seeding-system and lately the qualifying rounds. "The club’s primary objective is to improve the general quality of football in the community, more than to win the competition itself," said tournament director Eddie Pienaar. "Part of our social responsibility is to take the kids away from the streets, away from the drugs and substance abuse."
