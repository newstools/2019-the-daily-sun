AFTER Orlando Pirates crashed out in the Telkom Knockout quarter-final, former club’s captain Lucky Lekgwathi feels embarrassed and saddened. The part that bring sadness to Lekgwathi’s face is the fact that the last time the Soweto giants won the trophy was when he was still a player in 2014. And the last time Bucs hoisted a cup in the PSL was when they clinched the Nedbank Cup after defeating Bidvest Wits at Durban’s Moses Mabhida. That drought will continue until the end of the year after they lost to Kaizer Chiefs in the TKO quarter-final on penalties at Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. If they don’t win anything this season, that will be deemed as a backward step for Pirates after coming so close twice to win the league in the last two seasons. “It’s not nice. My team are struggling and have not won a trophy since my days at the club,” said Lekgwathi. Lekgwathi, who spent 13 seasons at the club, feels Bucs are struggling because they lack character of players he worked with at that time. Pirates have failed to replace the likes of Lekgwathi, Siyabonga Sangweni, Rooi Mahamutsa, Daine Klate, Moeneeb Josephs and Benson Mhlongo. These were reputable players capable of winning silverware. “I was privileged to be surrounded by top players,” said Phinda Mzala, as Lekgwathi is affectionately known. “If you count at Pirates now, how many senior players? It is not easy for them to emulate us. Sometimes these players must be reminded about the importance of playing for Orlando Pirates and playing for that badge.” Number 14 is associated with Lekgwathi’s football career. 2014 was the last year he played, which was that Nedbank Cup final celebration. He won 14 trophies at Pirates, he earned 14 caps for Bafana Bafana, and 14 is number he also wore at Pirates. The 2015-16 season is when he retired just before the first league game of that season. Had he played, it was going to be his 14 season with the club. “Everything of mine has 14 and it just happened,” he laughed.
