BLACK FRIDAY is here, and the festive season comes with it. It’s important to warn shoppers against going on a pre-Christmas splurge. According to BankservAfrica, Mzansi people spent close to R3 billion on Black Friday sales last year, 15,92% more than the previous year. Susan Steward from Budget Insurance said before you go ballistic this Black Friday, make sure you’ve made provision for all the things you need to pay for. “Don’t feel pressured to take advantage of every deal you see,” warned Susan. “Lack of control won’t only result in you buying things you don’t need, but could easily land you in debt over the festive season.” To help you avoid falling into the urge-to-spend trap this Black Friday, Budget Insurance shared these helpful tips: Budget beforehand: setting a budget will help you limit your spending. If you’re planning to buy gifts, budget per person so you know exactly what you can afford to spend on each of them. Compare prices: during the year’s biggest promotional event, you may assume you’re getting the best prices, but this isn’t always the case. So to avoid getting duped, do your research before making your purchase Shop smart with your smartphone: download money saving and budgeting apps like Spending Tracker, which allows you to set your budget, log your transactions and track your spending. Give those wish lists a reality check: manage your kids’ expectations when it comes to Christmas gifts. Many parents find themselves dipping into their savings after overspending on their kids’ gifts. Plan what gifts you are going to buy and shop with a purpose: don’t wonder around the shopping centre aimlessly because you will end up buying items you didn’t plan for and over-spend. An expensive month is around the corner: keep in mind that the month when many of us have the least to spare also happens to be a very expensive one. This especially for parents who need to pay for school uniforms and school fees come January.
