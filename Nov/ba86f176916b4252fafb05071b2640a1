THE planned introduction of a facial recognition system to catch criminals and find missing kids has been met with criticism. Human rights and technology experts yesterday warned of risks to privacy that could emanate from increased surveillance. India’s national crime bureau said the use of camera technology was aimed at modernising the police force, information gathering and criminal identification and verification. This is possibly one of the biggest facial recognition systems in the world. The government contract is due to be awarded today. But there’s little information on where it will be deployed, what the data will be used for and how data storage will be regulated, according to Apar Gupta, executive director of non-profit Internet Freedom Foundation. “It’s a mass surveillance system that gathers data in public places without there being an underlying cause to do so,” he said. “Without a data protection law and an electronic surveillance framework, it can lead to social policing and control,” he said. Worldwide, the rise of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies has popularised the use of facial recognition for a range of applications, from tracking criminals to catching truant students. There’s a growing backlash, however. In San Francisco in the US authorities banned the use of facial recognition technology by city personnel. The technology was launched in a few Indian airports in July. Delhi police last year found 3 000 missing kids during a trial. – Thomson Reuters Foundation
