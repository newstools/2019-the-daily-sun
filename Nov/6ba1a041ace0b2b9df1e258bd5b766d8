CAPE Town City skipper Thami Mkhize says they did not do enough to protect former coach Benni McCarthy from losing his job. The Citizens recently cut ties with McCarthy, following a string of poor results, which saw them manage only one win in nine league games. CAPE TOWN CITY SACK BENNI! McCarthy has since been replaced by Jan Riekerink. But Mkhize believes the players could have done more to prevent McCarthy from getting the boot, as they are the ones who were getting on the field and not the former Bafana Bafana striker. “The coach stands on the line and gives instructions. He cannot get on the field and show us what to do,” reasoned Mkhize. “He only illustrated during training sessions. To be honest, we are the one’s (players) who let coach Benni down. There were times where we could have done better in terms of getting results and winning matches. Mkhize singled out a couple of games where they could have won. He went further: “When the team is not doing well all fingers point to the coach and if the team is winning credit goes to players. That on its own is not fair.” “Games against Orlando Pirates and Baroka, we took early leads and were supposed to win them. But we ended up playing 3-3 and 2-2 draws respectively. “It was a norm that we lead games or control matches but end up losing or drawing.” However, a lot is expected from the new man in charge. Riekerink is set to start his tenure when City visit Bloemfontein Celtic in their Absa Premiership match at Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday. Mkhize concluded: “What is important now is to focus on the work and get results under the new coach. It will be very important that we welcome him with a win in his first match in charge and I believe we will do that.”
