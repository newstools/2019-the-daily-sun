GRADUATION ceremonies are always joyous moments for the graduates and their families. In Mzansi,social media lights up every year with graduation photos and videos,singing and dancing celebrating years of hard work. But one video which has gone viral from the US shows a mum celebrating her son in a very different way! In what looks to be a high school graduation,the son is called on stage and his mum,standing on the sidelines at the back starts screaming his name and starts twerking! The young looking mum with purple hair and a yellow jumpsuit starts dancing and twerking while the other students cheer her on.But a big hand of a security official cuts her celebration short.  Bruh...I really hope he thought this was funny cause I promise I wouldn’t talk to Sue for a hot 60 daysOut of Control Mom Twerks at Son’s graduation https://t.co/OrPGJxFkuO via @YouTube
