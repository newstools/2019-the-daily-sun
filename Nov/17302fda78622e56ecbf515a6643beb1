THE mum in a wheelchair and her seven-year-old daughter are in urgent need of help. Veronica Baloyi (41) has not been able to sleep after part of her house in Kgabalatsane, North West, caved in on Tuesday night. Veronica said she was asleep when she heard a loud bang. “I was scared and waited until morning to check what had happened. I found half of my roof had caved in and all the furniture soaking wet,” she said.  Veronica said the water caused a huge crack in the wall. “We have been unable to sleep since it happened because we fear the rest of the house will collapse if it rains again,” she said. Veronica said she was unemployed and couldn’t afford to have her house fixed. READ: PASTOR TURNS TO WINE! “We survive on my disability grant money,” she said. She pleaded with Good Samaritans to help her fix her house. “Any help will be appreciated. I can’t bear to see the fear in my child’s face every time it starts to rain. I’m also scared of what could happen if there was strong wind,” she said. Councillor Malebo Rakofa said she didn’t want to make any promises. “I didn’t know they had this kind of problem. I will also try to get donations from our municipality but that’s a long shot,” she said.
