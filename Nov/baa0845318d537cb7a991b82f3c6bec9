RHULANI Mokwena’s mumbo-jumbo must be a huge cause for concern for Orlando Pirates fans heading into the Soweto derby. In a time when they need to see results on the field, or listen to some war talk bravado, the Bucs’ faithful have had to listen to their coach rambling about art. Those who were expecting some fighting talk ahead of Bucs’ meeting with arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs, especially given that they lost the last encounter, were instead given another lesson in the arts. Having described their performance in the Telkom Knockout defeat to Amakhosi as similar to watching the Mona Lisa painting with admiration, Mokwena has taken it a step further. He revealed that he has even taken up painting himself as a way to relieve some of the pressure he has found himself under since taking the Bucs hot seat. “Pressure is the name of the game at Orlando Pirates,” said Mokwena. “I have recently taken up painting. It helps me deal with it. “But the performances have been there, which is encouraging, it’s just the results that have not been forthcoming. “And that happens sometimes. Life is not fair, the results have not matched the performances that we have produced.” But Bucs fans will be hoping that he puts away his painting brush and provides a tactical master class to overcome their high-flying neighbours. Bucs head into the clash desperate for a change in fortunes, having endured a tough campaign so far. They have only managed to garner 13 points from their 10 league matches so far – leaving them in seventh spot on the standings – 12 points behind their rivals Chiefs. Nevertheless, Mokwena insists that they will turn the corner sooner rather than later. He believes victory over Chiefs in their Premiership tussle at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) will help send them in the right direction. “We want to represent our fans well and give the best performance for ninety minutes,” added Mokwena.
