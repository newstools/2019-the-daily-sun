INSTEAD of sitting at home doing nothing, Asanda Sobe decided to start his own business. The 30-year-old from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, cleans shoes for residents. His business is called Sneaker Clinic. “I didn’t want to sell fish and chips because a lot of people are doing that,” said Asanda. “I had to come up with something new in the kasi.” Asanda said he used to work at a shop but his contract ended. But he soon realised a lot of people hated washing their shoes and takkies. “Some don’t have time to wash their shoes because they’re always at work, but others just don’t like to do it. “I’m here for them. They must not worry anymore,” he said. “I run this business from home. My wish is to get a bigger place at a mall where it will be easy for people to find me.” Asanda said the services he offered were sneaker revival, sneaker rehab and stay fresh. “Revival is when I wash shoes inside and out with the laces and spray them, while rehab is outside only, but with deodorant. With stay fresh, I brush the shoes while the owners wear them.” Asanda charges between R50 and R65 and only keeps shoes for one day. Resident Mandisi Mlonyeni (34) said he really liked Asanda’s idea. “This will help a lot of people because so many are wearing dirty and stinky sneakers,” he said.
