The actress and theatre performer whose real name is Masasa Mbangeni is grateful that her industry friend Sibulele Gcilitshana gave her all the time she needed to be where she is today. The 32-year-old from Port Elizabeth shared on her social media how Sibulele was patient with her and helped her a lot when she stared with her acting career. She wrote a long message that read: “I will never forget Sibulele Gcilitshana took me under her wing when I first started. Always there with loving advice and support. This one has been loving and healing me for a decade.” The actress further added that she remembered being scared to return to acting after a year of teaching. Masasa said Sibulele made sure that she goes through the script with her until it was late. The performer said they would go line by line and doing translations where they can.
