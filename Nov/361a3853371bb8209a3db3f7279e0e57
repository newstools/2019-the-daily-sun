NHLANHLA Mkhize said he still doesn’t believe how he cheated death. He said he narrowly escaped being killed by a big two-metre long python.  The 60-year-old man from J section KwaMashu J section, north of Durban, claimed he fought and overpowered the two-metre long reptile while walking alone on a footbridge between N and J sections on Sunday. “When I got to the middle of the bridge, the snake suddenly came up to me. It wrapped itself around my body. I then held its head very tightly, trying to get it off me. I then fell into the stream while holding it with my hands.

I couldn’t just easily throw it because it was wrapped on my arm and at that time I was so afraid. All I could think about was getting its head away from me,” Nhlanhla claimed. He said one of the men shouted that he should not look at its eyes, but he should just throw it away so that it doesn’t harm him. “I asked them to come and hit its head. But they were afraid to do that. I battled to throw the snake, but eventually I succeeded,” he claimed. Nhlanhla said he realised he had hurt his back when he got out of the stream. His cellphone was also damaged when he fell into the stream. “I’ve always walked past that bridge but I’ve never come across a snake. It was very big and about two metres long. That bridge shouldn’t be used anymore, people will get killed,” he said. READ: BOSS FORCED ME TO SUCK HIS 4-5! He said on Tuesday he dreamt about the incident. “It really shocked me maybe that’s why I dreamt of it,” Nhlanhla said. A resident Abel Shezi (24) said he was also walking passed the bridge when he saw people standing at the top of it looking into the stream. “When I also looked, I saw the snake and I ran away because I’m terrified of snakes,” he said.
