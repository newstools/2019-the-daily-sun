POLOKWANE City caretaker coach Bernard Molekwa says there is no need for their fans to panic. The soft spoken Molekwa made this statement after his charges narrowly lost 3-2 to Soweto giants Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium on Tuesday. This was his second defeat in a row since he was mandated to stabilise the team following the sacking of Serbian Zlatko Krmpotic due to a string of poor results. He lost his first match at the helm 1-0 to local rivals Baroka FC prior to the Fifa calendar break. In fact, Rise and Shine have now lost seven matches in 12 league games this season. The Limpopo side have the third worst defence in the league after Cape Town City (20) and Orlando Pirates (18), having conceded 17 goals so far. Even though only six points (prior to yesterday’s fixtures) separate Rise and Shine with bottom club Chippa United, Molekwa insist that his side will never get relegated. He went on: “Everyone in this league want results. Yes, I agree results haven’t gone our way, but with the performance the boys showed since I took over, I am confident that we will turn the corner. It doesn’t mean when the team is not getting results we are doing bad. No, we just have to ensure we score goals and then we will get better.” Molekwa says he is in the dark when club boss Johnny Mogaladi will appoint the new coach. “I am doing what the management have asked me to do which is to coach the team. I am always available if he asks me to do, a certain job and at the moment I am doing exactly that. I still believe that as much as the result are not coming our way we will eventually get them.” Rise and Shine captain Jabu Maluleke echoed Molekwa’s sentiment emphasising that it’s still early to stress about the thought of relegation. “I don’t think it’s time for us to stress about relegation because there is still plenty of time to improve our position. We are not doing bad.”
