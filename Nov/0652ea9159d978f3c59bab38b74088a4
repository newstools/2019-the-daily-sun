THE family of a widow who was murdered in her house just want to focus on organising her funeral. Zibuyisile Xulu (38) from Eshowe, northern KZN, died in her bedroom on Tuesday night after someone fired several shots through her window. Her 33-year-old boyfriend, who she had been living with for two years, was arrested and was expected to appear in court soon. “The boyfriend was arrested, so maybe the cops know something they haven’t told us as a family.” When asked whether Zibuyisile had enemies, her sister Thandi Mgwaba said she wasn’t on good terms with her in-laws, but had no enemies. She said the family just wanted to focus on the funeral and would leave the investigation to the cops. KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened with the Eshowe cops. “She sustained a gunshot wound to the head and was declared dead on the scene.” Gwala said a 33-year-old man was arrested for murder on Wednesday and was expected in the Eshowe Magistrates Court soon.
