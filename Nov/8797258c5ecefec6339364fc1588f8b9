MEDICAL opinion says there’s no medicine that can make a man’s 4-5 bigger. But Mahlasela Ngoveni (47) disagrees. Mahlasela said a tree in his yard in Lulekani Matiko Xikaya, near Phalaborwa, in Limpopo, helped men with small 4-5s. “I’m Mr Fix. No one can match my knowledge of herbs,” he claimed. “I’ve helped so many people, the list is endless. My tree can give a man a huge penis that will satisfy any woman in the world.” Ronny Valoyi (35) told Daily Sun he was struggling to make his wife happy in bed. “Then I heard about Ngoveni’s magic tree,” he said. “I’m a proud man now. I can even take my penis out in public, near other men, when I want to pee.” Mahlasela said: “We’re living in times when men are afraid to speak about their bedroom problems.” He charges R2 500 for his muthi. “I know medical doctors say there’s no way a size can be enlarged. But we as traditional healers have divine powers to enlarge it,” he said. Dr Ammonia Mabasa at Malamulele Hospital said it was not medically possible for a penis to be enlarged.
