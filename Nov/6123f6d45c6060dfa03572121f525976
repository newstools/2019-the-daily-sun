A WARRANT of arrest has been issued against a man after he failed to appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court yesterday. The 24-year-old man was released on warning after he handed himself over to the cops for allegedly poking a goat.  The incident happened on Friday at Autherstone Village outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga. The goat is believed to be owned by a local pastor. The man was allegedly caught naked in the kraal where one of the goats was kept. According to Mhala police spokesman Captain S’fiso Nyakane, the owner heard a strange sound during the night coming from the kraal. When he went to investigate, he allegedly caught the suspect naked.

The man’s parents apparently confirmed the clothes belong to the man. “This was allegedly not the first time he poked the goat,” said Nyakane. He said a manhunt was launched after the owner reported the matter to the police. After he heard the police were looking for him, the man handed himself over to the cops accompanied by his mother. Prosecutor Musa Makhubele said the man, who is charged with bestiality, was supposed to appear in court. He asked the matter to be postponed to 19 November and said a warrant of arrest has been issued.
