SIYA Kolisi helped to unite millions of Mzansi citizens and even Afrikaans singer Robbie Wessels has written a song to celebrate the great captain. The English song is making waves on social media under the hashtag #StrongerTogether. It has 110 155 YouTube views and is growing. Wessels told Daily Sun he was at his house thinking he might write a song about Kolisi. “Five minutes later my agent forwarded a Facebook message to me from a guy telling me maybe I should write a song about the captain,” he said. “The next morning I was sitting on my couch and praying and I felt in my heart to write the song.

Part of the lyrics goes - stronger together we work better as one. Wessels said it would be a great privilege for him to meet the captain. The SunTeam tried without success to reach Kolisi. SA Rugby said Kolisi asked for time off and wasn’t taking interviews.
