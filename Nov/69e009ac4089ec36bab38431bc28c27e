Tottenham club captain Hugo Lloris says he has never been in so much pain as he was in when he fractured his elbow against Brighton. The France international was forced off in the opening minute of the game at the Amex Stadium and his since been under the knife to resolve the issue. Tottenham have suggested it will be January by the time Lloris is back in action and Spurs could do with his return as they continue to endure a tough start to the Premier League campaign. Lloris has admitted it was the most pain he had ever experienced but is now positive about his return. "I’m positive in the head," he told L’Equipe. "We go through the sessions and then we move on. In sight, it’s January, so we’re doing what it takes to get back to where it belongs. "My injury? This is a rupture at the level of a ligament. I also suffered at the level of a muscle, under the biceps with a big lesion. I had surgery after 4 weeks. We left a chance that it heals naturally, but after four weeks we feared for the stability of the arm for the future. Since the start, it was planned like that. And it does not delay more than that the deadlines." He added: "At the moment, yes, the pain is unbearable. I have never experienced such pain but no I am not worried about my career." Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will be looking forward to having Lloris back between the sticks in the new year, with his side now battling to secure a top-four finish. Tottenham find themselves down in 14th place in the Premier League table with 11 points between them and Manchester City in fourth spot. Spurs are next in action in the early kick-off on Saturday when they make the trip across the capital to face West Ham at the London Stadium.
