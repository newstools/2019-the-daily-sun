MATRIC pupils at Marumofase High School in Senwabarwana, Limpopo, don’t have an excuse to do well this academic year. This is because Soutpan Solar Powers is running Grade 12 programmes every day with a purpose of closing the gap in crucial subjects such as maths, science and English. Teacher Johannes Tlhaboloa said the programme had impacted positively on their matric performance in the past and they were hoping that the organisation would continue lending a helpinghand. “Four of our pupils attained a Bachelors pass in the prelim exams in maths, physical science and accounting and we’re proud of them,” he said. This matric programme is designed to supplement what teachers do on a daily basis. It focuses on the vital three subjects, to equip pupils with academic results that will allow them to pursue tertiary studies and careers. The organisation only focuses on schools situated in the rural areas where technology and other basic laboratory equipment are not available. Grade 12 pupil Molatelo Machaka (17) told Daily Sun: “We have benefited from the centre because we’ve had access to study guides and other resources that have helped us improve our marks. It has given us the opportunity to apply to universities once we finish matric.” Economic development officer Harrisinah Theka said their programme included a stipend for retired teachers and equipment such as laptops, computers, study guides, administrative items, winter school support programmes and a career expo. “We also provide transport for pupils to and from their schools to the centre to make sure they dont miss out,” she said.
