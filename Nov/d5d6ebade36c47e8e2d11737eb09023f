RELATIVES of the teenager killed by a speeding car don’t know how they will bury him. Siyamukela Mabanga (15) from Nzondwana in Nongoma, northern KZN, died instantly after he was hit by a car on Monday. Aunt Sgcino (28) said Siyamukela and a friend had just stepped out of a taxi when the accident happened. “Witnesses told us his friend crossed the road safely, but Siyamukela wasn’t so lucky.” Sgcino said the driver stopped several metres away after hitting Siyamukela as he was speeding. She said the driver and his family had not contacted her. “I’m going to wait and see if they come to see our family and have a talk with us because we want them to help us with burial costs,” she said. “I don’t know how I’m going to bury him. We don’t have money.” Sgcino said she was unemployed and her family survived on Siyamukela and his three siblings’ foster grants. “Their mum died about 10 years ago when I was only 18 and I had to look after them as I was the eldest in the family.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “Cops from Nongoma cop shop are investigating a culpable homicide case after Siyamukela Mabanga was killed when he allegedly was hit by a car.”
