CAPETONIANS are shocked after a cop was shot and killed in front of his house in the Cape Flats yesterday. Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Kay was shot on 11th Avenue in Bishop Lavis as he was leaving his house to take a friend to hospital. A close family friend said the cop was on leave when he was killed. The 52-year-old police officer, who was stationed at Bishop Lavis SAPS, has been described as a dedicated policeman. He was attached to the provincial firearms, liquor and second-hand goods control unit. The incident comes just four days after a Hawks member, Christelle Stemmet, died at her home in Table View after she was shot twice by assailants, who then fled the scene. Acting Western Cape Provincial Commissioner Sindile Mfazi conveyed his heartfelt condolences to Kay’s loved ones. “It’s alleged that the lieutenant-colonel had just got into his vehicle when an unknown gunman in a vehicle approached him and shot him several times. He died on the scene,” said Brigadier Novela Potelwa. “His family and colleagues are currently receiving trauma counselling,” he said. Potelwa has called on residents to assist with information that could lead to the arrests of the assailants. Anyone with the relevant information is urged to contact the anti-gang unit hotline number 080 0664 264.
