POLOKWANE CITY have fired their coach Zlatko Krmpotic following a poor string of results this season. Rise and Shine have lost all of their last five matches in all competitions, leading to Krmpotic's demise. Although they are still in the top eight in the Absa Premiership, their form was beginning to deteriorate. They last picked up a point in September in a 3-1 win over SuperSport United. Krmpotic becomes the sixth PSL coach to bite the dust after Milutin 'Micho' Sredojevic, Clinton Larsen, Cavin Johnson, Lionel Soccoia and Benni McCarthy all vacated their roles. “It is with regret that we announce the departure of Zlatko Krmpotic as the Head Coach of Polokwane City Football Club,” the club confirmed in a statement. “Despite the best efforts of the Club, the Head Coach and all Parties involved with the Club, recent results on the field of play, have, unfortunately, not gone in our favour. “This has prompted the Club and the Head Coach to reconsider the position of Zlatko as the Head Coach of the Club. “In the circumstances, pursuant to a meeting between the Club Chairman, Mr. Johnny Mogaladi and the Head Coach it was agreed, in the best interests of the Club, that the Club and Head Coach part ways in an amicable manner. “Accordingly, the Parties have signed a mutual termination of their Contract of Employment with immediate effect. As of this morning, Zlatko has been relieved of his duties and is no longer the Head Coach of Polokwane City FC.”
