THEY were
living on the street after being kicked out by their mastandi for failing to
pay R250 rent. But after
Daily Sun published the story of Tumi Buti (25), his girlfriend Nthabiseng
Mopeli (25) and their kids, SunReaders opened their hearts and wallets. The family
is back in their rented shack after readers donated R3 700 and Boxer gave them
a R2 000 grocery vouchers. Tumi was
smiling from ear to ear yesterday as he bought groceries for his kids. “We thank
the Good Samaritans who came forward to help. This food will last us some
time,” he said. Tumi said
his dream was to go back to school and finish his matric so he could study
further. He had to drop out of school years ago because of family problems. Tumi and
Nthabiseng were evicted from their shack in Faraday, Joburg, after failing to
pay rent for two months. They ended
up living on the street with their two-year-old son and month-old baby. Tumi
used to work as a gardener in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, but lost his job. After
reading about their situation, Joburg creche owner George Ralekgogo gave them
temporary accommodation and helped Tumi get a new ID, as he’d lost his old one
several years ago. He also bought the family clothes. He said:
“Tumi applied for an ID and he’s still waiting for the card. With an ID, his
life can move forward.” Readers and
