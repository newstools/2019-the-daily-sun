 GUGU Ncube has poured out her disappointment on how her case
is being handled! She told Daily Sun that she is disappointed again by the
court’s outcome after her case was postponed once more. The Pretoria Magistrate Court postponed her case of Public
Indecency and Demonstration without permission to 19 February next year for
plea and trial. The court postponed the case due to time constraint. This was after Gugu did a naked protest at the Union
Buildings midyear as cry out for the abuse she was allegedly experiencing. She also blamed the justice system for not protecting woman
enough as she protested wearing a bra and panties only. Gugu Ncube (38) told Daily Sun that women are still
disrespected in Africa. "Africa is led by pervert and those people don't have
respect for women." "Women are not protected and we are a playing
ground," she said. Gugu said she will wait for next year even though the case
is tormenting and bringing suffering to her as she doesn't work. "Imagine I have to be in court almost every month. “I'm heart broken and disappointed," she said. Gugu said Africa has failed her and no one is willing to
help her. Gugu who is a mother of 19-year-old son says the court
matter is not only disturbing her alone but her son too. Gugu's last appearance in the same court was on 25
September.
