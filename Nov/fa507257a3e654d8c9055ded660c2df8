MIDFIELDER Keagan Buchanan faces a bleak future at Maritzburg United. The 28-year-old, who joined the Team of Choice at the beginning of last season on a three-year contract, has barely featured. His move to the Midlands club came after he was released by Kaizer Chiefs at the end of 2017-18 Absa Premiership season. The former Bloemfontein Celtic midfielder was looking to rekindle his football career but this has not been the case. Just few months after he joined the club, he was unfortunate to suffer a bad knee injury last September. He was ruled out for the rest of last season. “Keagan recognises the fact that we supported him very well in his rehab and he owes us this season,” said Maritzburg chairman Farouk Kadodia. At the beginning of this season, Kadodia said he was expecting Buchanan to step up after the club lost midfield duo - Fortune Makaringe and Siphesihle Ndlovu to Orlando Pirates. However, he has only played in five league matches, two from the start.
