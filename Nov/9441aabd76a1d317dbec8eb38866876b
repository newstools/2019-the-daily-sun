RESIDENTS of Malacca squatter Camp in Redhill, north of Durban, have been living without toilets for the past five months. This after the toilets were locked by committee members as they posed a health hazard. READ: HE DIED ON THE SPOT! One of the committee members, Nokuthula Ngcobo, said the eThekwini Municipality failed to look after the toilets. “We have two toilets, one for men and one for women, but both are in a terrible condition. A decision to lock them was taken when kak overflowed,” said Ngcobo. She said the kak almost got into residents’ shacks.  “It nearly became a disaster. Other residents tried cleaning it with water, but it didn’t make a difference,” said Ngcobo. She said she reported the matter to the municipality and ward councillor with no success. “I’m in possession of five different reference numbers I got every time I called the municipality to fix the problem. “They sent plumbers once but that didn’t help because we don’t need plumbers. We need people who will suck the kak out of the toilets. “The councillor told us there is nothing he can do because we are overcrowded and the toilets were meant for a certain number of people,” said Ngcobo.  Another member of the committee, Siyabulela Dela, said the problem forced them to relieve themselves in the bushes. “It’s even hard there because residents relieve themselves all over the place because they have no choice. It’s dangerous to go there at night, especially for women and kids, so we are forced to accompany them,” said Dela. Daily Sun contacted the municipality for comment on Saturday. Zoe Skeef and Lele Shabalala from the communication unit acknowledged receipt of the email yesterday. They said they had sent it to the relevant department but the SunTeam had not received a response at the time of going to print.
