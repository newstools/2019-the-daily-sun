NEWLY ELECTED DA interim leader John Steenhuisen promises to stop going on about how bad the ANC is and focus on what his party can deliver. “No more blue wobbly jelly at the centre of politics. We need to be firm and unwavering about the principle of what our party stands for,” he told reporters at the party headquarters in Joburg yesterday. Steenhuisen will be the party’s temporary leader until it holds its elective conference in May. Ivan Meyer replaced Athol Trollip as federal executive chairman. Steenhuisen said his election should not be seen as a stab in the back because Mmusi Maimane resigned. He said party policies would target the 99% of the population categorised as poor by Statistics SA. “As we set off on this path, I want you to know exactly what you can expect from me. I will shoot straight. I will not have different conversations with different people. You will always know where you stand with me,” he promised. He committed himself to fighting inequality, but said most race-based policies had not worked with the inequality gap widening after 25 years of democracy.
