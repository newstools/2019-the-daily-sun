WHEN Baroka FC boss Khurishi Mphahlele hired Tshepo Maphuta, the kasi landscaper was over the moon. But the relationship soon turned sour and, according to Tshepo, he’s still owed R33 000 of the R54 000 he apparently was promised. The deal was that he’d plant grass at a new stadium in Lebowakgomo, Limpopo. The 44-year-old from Lebowakgomo zone B told Daily Sun he trusted Khurishi as he’d done landscaping at his house.

He paid me R5 000 after the first week and R10 000 more towards month end. “He started dodging me when I called his offices for the rest. He eventually left R6 000 at his club offices last Monday.” Khurishi accused Tshepo of lying, saying: “I paid him all his money.” Khurishi told the SunTeam he and  Tshepo agreed on R10 000 a month until the job was done. “Let him show you the invoice and stop lying. When he got his first payment, he left and never finished the work. “Why should I pay him more? He messed up the grass. I hired others to fix it,” he said. Khurishi claimed he only paid Tshepo R10 000 at the end of last month and knew nothing about the R21 000 he claims he was paid, or of the outstanding R33 000.
