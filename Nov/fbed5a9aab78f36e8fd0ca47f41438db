The workers downed tools on Thursday and disrupted work, which forced the municipality to close offices and cancel the imbizo that was to take place on Saturday. Yesterday, Mayor Vincent Chili told Daily Sun Hadebe wrote him an email on Monday, in which he acknowledged he had made a mistake. Chili said he asked Hadebe to write a formal letter and submit it to him by the end of this week. “I’m just waiting for his formal explanation in a letter, then I will look at what the policy says about his behaviour and take it from there. “If he is found to have broken the municipal act, action will be taken,” said Chili. The workers complained about a director they claimed gave a car allowance to a manager. After workers left the offices, a photo of Hadebe partying with them ended up all over social media. He is seen wearing a Samwu T-shirt and sitting on a cooler box.

He called for his immediate suspension. “The strike action disrupted municipal services and the manager is seen celebrating disruption with the workers. “This is why we are calling for his suspension,” said Hlophe. Hadebe said he was passing by when the workers asked him to take photos with them and gave him a T-shirt. He said all managers qualified for a car allowance.
