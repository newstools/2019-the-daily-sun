PETUNIA Nhlengethwa (43) blames Eskom for the death of her mother. Her mum, Ruth Kgosiejang (67) of White City Jabavu, Soweto, depended on an oxygen nebuliser, which uses electricity. “Eskom killed my mum!” she said.  “She had been struggling to breathe since the transformer blew up and Eskom refused to fix it. “There were times when she would be gasping for breath and all we could do was take her outside to get some air.” Kgosiejang was buried on Saturday.

Petunia told Daily Sun her mother was taken to the clinic because she was struggling to breathe. “After they gave her oxygen they sent her to Bara hospital where she died a week later. According to Petunia, her mum started using the nebuliser earlier this year. Another victim in the area, gogo Ida Masilela (75), has moved to Senaoane. She was hospitalised after the electricity went off in June.  Ida said one of the ladies from her church offered her a place to stay. “I miss my bed but I need electricity to stay alive. I have been staying here for two months. We are pleading with Eskom to feel for us.” Eskom spokeswoman Reneiloe Semenya said they have increased efforts to recover money for electricity. “They must allow us to operate without interference as we are often confronted with hostility. “Eskom is not in a position to continue to provide services while customers are not paying.”
