DESPITE getting maximum points against on form Highlands Park, Bloemfontein Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema is not a happy man as he is struggling to field his best squad due to injuries. Since the 2019-20 Absa Premiership season started Seema and his co-coaches, John Maduka and Simon Gopane (goalkeeper coach) have not had a full, injury-free squad. And that has resulted in finding it difficult to build momentum and keep consistency. And that worries Seema who has ambitions of leading the club into the top eight before the Christmas recess. “Injuries have been our main concern and they are destabilising our plan,” a worried Seema implied. “During the off-season, we blended our experienced squad with young blood from the MDC team and also brought new signings. We started the season well and our medical team have done a good job as we have been facing an injury crisis.” On Tuesday night Celtic shocked Highlands with a 3-1 defeat at Dr Molemela Stadium. Ndumiso Mabena and Menzi Masuka who came off the bench after recovering from injuries scored crucial goals in the 81st, and 82nd minutes respectively to help the team register their third victory of the season. Seema said: “Against Highlands, we had to start with some of our key players (Mabena and Masuku) on the bench because they have not gained enough mileage, they are not match fit as they just returned from injuries. We are trying to manage them well”. “At the moment Wandisile Letlabika is still far from returning. He sustained a knee injury as well as Tshepo Rikhotso is out for a while,” the former player added. “Rikhotso dislocated his shoulder. Tebogo Potsane will be back before the December break.” Celtic have five games remaining before the Christmas break. They face Maritzburg United tomorrow at Harry Gwala Stadium (8pm). That encounter will be followed by matches against Cape Town City, Polokwane City Kaizer Chiefs and AmaZulu.
