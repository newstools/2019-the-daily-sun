NEW magoshas came to town and started taking some of her clients. So she made a plan to make sure her clients kept coming back. But her plan didn’t work and her punani’s now doing double duty. This after Siphesihle Nkomo (36) from Joburg went to a sangoma, who gave her muthi. “I’ve been in this business for nine years and things were great when I started. But I was always broke before I went to the sangoma,” she said. Siphesihle said the sangoma charged her R2 500 and gave her muthi to steam and apply on her punani. She said she only used it for three months and her clients went from three in a week to a minimum of six a day. “I was so happy. But when none of my clients could ejaculate, I quickly went back to the sangoma to ask about this and she told me these were the after effects of the treatment but would soon wear off,” she said. But the muthi didn’t wear off and Siphesihle went back to the sangoma, but she was nowhere to be found. Some of Siphesihle’s clients said they were happy. One of the clients (46) told Daily Sun: “I enjoy her so much and can’t get enough. It’s a pity she ends up chasing me away. I’m sorry, but I hope she doesn’t get help.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said he’d never dealt with such. “Using muthi on your punani is always a terrible thing. There are always comebacks,” he said.
