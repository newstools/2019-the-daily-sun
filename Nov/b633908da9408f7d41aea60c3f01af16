CEBISILE Luphondwe’s family is traumatised. The body of the 15-year-old from Glencoe, northern KZN, was found in the bushes on Monday. She’d been missing for three weeks after being murdered, allegedly by her boyfriend (23). Cebisile’s aunt Zanele Buthelezi (30) said they thought she’d return home after a day, as she usually did. “We became worried and started searching for her when days went by and she didn’t return. “We never went to the suspect’s home as we weren’t aware they were dating.” They were tipped off by a neighbours that Cebisile was dating the suspect. They asked cops to accompany them to the boyfriend’s house. “It was locked and the boyfriend wasn’t there. Through the window we only saw the base of the bed. “We opened a missing persons’ case the next day and cops started their search.” Cops caught the boyfriend in Ladysmith on Monday. “He led them to the burnt body. What we know is that he stabbed her to death before his two friends helped him load her body into a wheelbarrow and dump it in nearby bushes. “We learnt that they burnt the body before leaving it there,” said Zanele. Cebisile’s parents died when she was only nine months old. The family said she was recently acting out. “She liked to go around with friends and sometimes didn’t return home. She loved singing and wanted to be an artist after completing matric.” She was a grade 9 pupil. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a murder case was being investigated by Glencoe cops. “The investigation led to Ladysmith, where the boyfriend (23) was arrested. Two more suspects aged 28 and 29 were arrested for murder.”
