A COUPLE’S love story has brought out the best in Mzansi. When a video of Hector Mkansi proposing to Nonhlanhla Soldaat at KFC was posted on social media on Friday, no one could have imagined the amount of love they’d receive.  By the end of the day, major companies, celebrities and ordinary South Africans public had offered the couple everything needed for a dream wedding. Speaking to the SunTeam on Saturday during the Soweto Derby at FNB Stadium in Joburg, where they were VIP guests, Hector said he wanted to remind Nonhlanhla of how much he adored her. The man from Vaal said: “We actually met at a funeral in 2010. I couldn’t believe my luck when I met such a beautiful woman. Because of that only death can separate us.”  After the video went viral, Daily Sun pledged a sheep for the wedding while artists such as Langa Mavuso, Amanda Black, Zakes Bantwini, Ami Faku, Dr Tumi and DJ PH promised to perform. The couple was also offered wedding outfits, rings, decorations, sound, catering, transport and a honeymoon. Nonhlanhla said on the day they went to buy food, she was just hungry and had no idea what was coming. “I thank God for him and I wish other women could find a man as loving as he is.” Hector said when they got to the food outlet, he asked the staff to place the ring inside the meal she had ordered. When she unwrapped it, she found it.  “We both just lost it and embraced each other and I went down on one knee,” he said. At the derby, Nonhlanhla was wearing a Pirates cap while Hector wore a Chiefs gown. “She may be a Pirates fan now, but as my wife, she’ll have to become Khosi for Life,” said Hector.
