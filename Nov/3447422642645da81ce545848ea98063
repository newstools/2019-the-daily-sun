LIVERPOOL head coach Jurgen Klopp has landed in South Africa after being spotted at the Cape Town International Airport on Tuesday. It is still unknown the reason for Klopp's visit to the Cape, but the German is connected to a local soccer charity for children, Joy is Round. Klopp recently donated £10 000 (R188 000) to the initiative run by the Hout Bay United Football Community. The Cape Town-based club, which runs a soccer academy for children aged seven to 18, oversees the initiative that aims to raise funds for grassroots soccer through the sale of balls and art made from old clothing and materials. Klopp's visit could be linked to checking on the progress made by the academy on the local community after his generous donation.The 52-year-old was also spotted meeting World Cup winning Springbok captain Siya Kolisi alongside Proteas captain Faf du Plessis.Sport24 reached out to Hout Bay FC who said that Klopp's trip was purely a holiday and is not linked to any official event at the club. -Sport24 About last night...
