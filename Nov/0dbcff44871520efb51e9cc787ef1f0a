HiFi Corp, after almost 3 decades continues to fight for low prices for consumers throughout Mzansi.  Plans for this year’s Black Friday started almost immediately after last year’s successful Black Friday to ensure that customer demands could be met by securing enough stock at the Lowest Prices! The stock mix includes TV’s, Cell phones, Computers, Audio and both large and small appliances at greatly reduced prices.  Speaking to Neil McLean the Marketing Executive, he assured me that HiFi Corp will once again not disappoint with great real savings, stock volumes and speedy deliveries.  He also stated that it would be beneficial for customers to pre-register online including a TV License validation to ensure a smooth online experience on Black Friday. HiFi Corp will run the Black Friday specials both online as well as in-store, but customers should try to get to stores early to avoid disappointment and grab amazing bargain deals. On the crazy and exciting Black Friday, HiFi Corp stores will open their doors at 07h00.  On top of the low prices, great savings HiFi Corp will be offering a Free Delivery service for all online purchases. HiFi Corp will release Black Friday deals starting on the 25th of November in Community Papers and online. Additional Black Friday Specials will also be loaded and be available at midnight 12h00 on the 28th of November. McLean said that in the current economy and consumers being under huge financial pressure, Black Friday is an awesome opportunity to buy at Low Prices with Real Savings, and the added benefit of  Free delivery.
