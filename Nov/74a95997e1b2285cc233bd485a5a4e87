CHIEF Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said it was shameful that after 25 years of democracy, inequality was worse than during apartheid. Mogoeng was speaking at the 17th Nelson Mandela Lecture, which tackled many issues such inequality, race and constitutionalism. The event was held at the University of Joburg Soweto Campus over the weekend. “What is wrong with our society? How did it come about that 25 years down the line, we still have people without homes? So many people, everywhere you go. “We still have racial discrimination, ethnicity, gender discrimination and even tribalism.” Speaking of the corporate space, he said: “It’s rare to find a woman, or a black person. We celebrate when we find just a handful.” “Anybody who says don’t blame anything on colonialism and apartheid is being mischievous. “Most problems we have to deal with right now are a consequence of colonialism and apartheid. It’s critical that we never stop talking about it. “What we can’t do is blame it all on colonialism and apartheid. If you’re indifferent because of the position that pays you well, if you’re indifferent to the plight of our people in Diepsloot or elsewhere because you are comfortable, know you are a traitor.”
