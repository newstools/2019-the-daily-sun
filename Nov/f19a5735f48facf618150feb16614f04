JUDGMENT’S been reserved in the bail application of the two Coligny farm workers found guilty of killing a teenager in 2017. Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte appeared before the North West High Court in Mahikeng yesterday. They were found guilty of throwing 16-year-old Matlhomola Mosweu off a moving bakkie after accusing him of stealing sunflower heads. In January, Doorewaard was sentenced to 18 years in prison and Schutte to 23 years. But reports later surfaced that sole witness, Bonakele Pakisi, might have lied. AfriForum got Advocate Barry Roux to take on the case and the Supreme Court of Appeal granted special leave to appeal. Roux said in court: “What would be the purpose of keeping them in jail? “Why would they run away where there is a prospect of success?” Prosecutor, Advocate Dan Moeketsi, said Pakisi’s testimony was not the only evidence that led to the conviction. “They have not shown cause as to why they should be released on bail pending appeal. “Therefore, the release of the applicants will not be in the interest of justice,” he said. AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel said what happened to Mosweu was a tragedy, but that didn’t mean innocent people should be punished. “If there is a prospect for them to be successful in their appeal, you cannot punish them by keeping them in jail. “You cannot put someone in jail because somebody else lied. “We are hopeful they will be granted bail,” he said. The pair will remain in custody until Judge Ronald Hendricks comes to a decision.
