Retiring Springbok legend Tendai "Beast" Mtawarira has taken to social media to express his astonishment at the crowds that have assembled for their Champions Tour of the country. The Springboks have taken the Webb Ellis Cup to Gauteng and Durban and will visit East London on Saturday and Port Elizabeth on Sunday before wrapping up their trip in Cape Town on Monday.
