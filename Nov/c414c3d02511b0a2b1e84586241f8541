HUNDREDS of workers have not been paid for two months. They said this was because their employer paid the wrong people!  Gatvol employees of SVK Holdings, a sub-contractor to Eskom, have been sleeping outside their boss’ complex in Lynnwood, Tshwane, for a week, demanding their money. The workers told Daily Sun they were sent WhatsApp messages last month telling them not to report for work. Electrician Thandine Skhosana (35), said they assumed they would still get their salaries, but heard nothing. “We tried to get clarity from the contractors and they said they had paid the money for our salaries,” she said.

Thandine said they went to SVK’s offices in Tshwane last Friday to speak to the CEO. “We spoke to him and he committed to paying us the following week, so we patiently waited until we saw there was no clear answer.” Another worker, Sabelo Matokana (33), said: “The contractors said they paid him. “We are talking about millions of rands he feels we don’t deserve after working hard.” “We are here because we don’t have a place to sleep. Our families are struggling and our lives are stuck.” The workers said the CEO’s neighbours, local shops and wholesalers had donated food to them.  CEO Andre van der Merwe said he had sympathy for the workers but that his company was not responsible for paying them. “There is a dispute between our sub-contractors. We’ve been trying to solve the problem.” He said the money would hopefully be paid in two days.
