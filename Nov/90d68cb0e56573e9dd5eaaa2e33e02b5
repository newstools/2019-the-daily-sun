Using sex toys has become a norm and more people aren't afraid to disclose that they do use them. A sex toy is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate human sexual pleasure, such as a dildo or vibrator. A research by Lovehoney has previously revealed that a sex toy can make a woman's orgasm last longer. Unusual masturbation methods are circulating the internet from cucumbers to bananas. One woman even confessed that she used to masturbate with her electric toothbrush. Metro reports that A quick search on social media around reveals that this woman isn’t the only one to have used bathroom tools to get an orgasm. ‘Using anything that isn’t intended to be a masturbating tool has its risks, even proper sex toys that aren’t properly cleaned or are deteriorating can lead to vaginal infections and urinary tract infections if bacteria gets into the urethra,’  Dr Diana Gall from Doctor 4 U tells Metro.‘While an electric toothbrush may seem like the perfect DIY masturbating tool, it can actually do more harm than good. The vibrating bristles on the toothbrush can actually cause abrasions, tears and cuts to the vulva and vagina, and cause the tissue to become inflamed.' she adds. ‘Vaginal tissue is delicate and minor tears can happen simply through penetrative sex or inserting objects into the vagina. ‘However, these tears and cuts make it easier for germs and bacteria to enter the body. It may cause soreness, bleeding, and increase your risk of contracting an STI as the infection can enter through open wounds. ‘Plus, if you’re using a toothbrush that has been used, you’re exposing yourself to even more germs and bacteria.’ the DR explained.
