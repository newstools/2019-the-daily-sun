A recent study suggests that opening specific windows in a taxi can reduce the spread of airborne disease, according to a new study. According to a study published this week in the South African Journal of Science,  ventilation is very important as it could reduce the spread of TB. The majority of South Africans use minibus taxis, and TB is one of the major diseases afflicting the country’s population. The abstract of the research reads: In minibus taxis – a popular form of public transport in South Africa – poor ventilation creates conditions that allow for transmission of airborne diseases, particularly tuberculosis. In this study, we focused on developing quantitative ventilation profiles for the 16-seater Toyota Quantum Ses’fikile model commonly used in the Cape Town metropole. The results obtained augment the limited data available on the role that natural ventilation can play in reducing TB transmission in minibus taxis. Ventilation rates were shown to depend on both the taxi speed and specific open window configuration, countering the notion that simply opening a random selection of windows provides adequate reduction in the transmission risk. Munya Matose, with the Division of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Cape Town, told Business Insider South Africa that they wanted to see “whether minibus taxis can provide sufficient ventilation in order to mitigate the potential spread of TB from undiagnosed and untreated passengers”.
