BAFANA Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki has moved swiftly to quell perceptions of disagreements between him and Kaizer Chiefs boss Ernst Middendorp. Ntseki, who often emphasise the importance of forging relations with PSL coaches, has been compelled to clear the air regarding the injury Eric Mathoho carried into Bafana’s camp for the Mali friendly last month. Middendorp appeared to suggest the line of communication wasn’t clear when he sought an update on Mathoho’s injury. “The medical report said Mathoho is ready,” said Ntseki. “He got a clean bill of health from our medical team and that is why we played him for 90 minutes. We’d rested him for two sessions when we were training and he then joined the team and did very well.“ Mathoho has been around for some time and he can’t play with an injury, not for Chiefs and not for the national team. “I think people don’t know my relationship with coach Ernst Middendorp. We worked together at Bloemfontein Celtic. We produced players together there,” said Ntseki. “We have a very good relationship and I think there was just a misunderstanding between his medical team, in terms of the report that was sent to our medical team. “I got a call from him wishing the team the best of luck. So, coach Middendorp and I, we are on good terms.” Medical issues have often put clubs at odds with the national teams. Naturally, Ntseki would be wary not to let misunderstandings mess up his relationship with the local clubs.
