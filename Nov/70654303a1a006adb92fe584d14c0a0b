A GROUP of around 150 law enforcement workers marched in Cape Town on Saturday, demanding to be insourced. The protest, organised by Samwu, started at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and ended at the Civic Centre, where a memorandum of grievances was handed over.

Samwu regional chairman Mzoxolo Miselo said: “These are extended public works programme workers on one-year contracts. “All that Cape Town executive director of safety and security, Richard Bosman, does is extend their contracts every year. “Employ them as your cops because you can’t do anything without them. Keeping them on contract is no good.  “They’re trained to use guns and there’s a possibility they could become criminals if their contracts end. “They know how law enforcement works and they have lots of information. “This is why we’re saying these people should be employed on a permanent basis.” Miselo said if the municipality failed to address their concerns, the officers would not work over Christmas. He said they had been complaining to Bosman for three years, but nothing was done. Miselo said the officers’ working conditions were bad and their offices in Khayelitsha had experienced a number of break-ins because they were not properly built.  “Some of these offices are in the bush and our worry is that our members may be ambushed and attacked by thugs,” he said. An officer told the SunTeam being on contract was not easy. “I’ve been in the service for three years, but I never know if my contract will be renewed. I just want stability in my job,” he said. Bosman accepted the memorandum on behalf of the municipality and promised to respond by the end of the week.
