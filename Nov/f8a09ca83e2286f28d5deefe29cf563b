SA Under-23 coach David Notoane says his charges will head into their third and final group match of the Africa U-23 Cup of Nations against Nigeria without any pressure. This after they managed to put themselves in a position of strength in Group B with a hard fought 1-0 win over the Ivory Coast in their last match. They head into their final Group B clash against the Olympic Eagles at the Al Salam Stadium on Friday (8 pm) needing at least a point to secure their passage to the semi-finals of the competition currently ongoing in Egypt. Nevertheless, Notoane is still well aware that anything can happen and has warned his side not to take anything for granted ahead of the last round of group matches. “The pressure is more on Nigeria to come and get the result than it is on us,” insists Notoane. “We look forward to a very exciting finish to the group stages. Of course, for me, we are where we wanted to be in terms of our plans for the tournament. “We are on top of the group going into the last game, which is where we wanted to be. “But the group is open, anyone can go through and anyone can go home depending on the results of the last matches. “We will be thoroughly prepared. We know what we are up against in Nigeria and we also know what we have to do in the match. “We always go into every game trying to win but if we can’t achieve that then we try to get something." Young Bafana’s hero against the Small Elephants on Tuesday, Teboho Mokoena, is expecting another tough clash against Nigeria. “It’s going to be a very tough match,” said the SuperSport United midfielder. “We are going to be more prepared than we were against Ivory Coast. We want a positive result because we can’t let Nigeria beat us tomorrow.”
