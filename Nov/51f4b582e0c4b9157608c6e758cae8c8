NEWLY crowned Miss Hazyview Reitumetse Mokoena wants to be an ambassador for vulnerable women and children. Reitumetse, crowned queen over the weekend, said the pageant helped her gain strength after suffering from abuse. She was physically and sexually abused by the man she loved. The 21-year-old told Daily Sun: “My boyfriend would hit me. “I kept quiet about the whole situation, but I could see that not speaking out was not helping. “I used to ask myself why this was happening to me. I realised being in such a situation didn’t make me less of a human being. “I had an encounter with someone who didn’t know how to love. I stopped blaming myself and started to embrace life.” Reitumetse said the abuse ended in February after she told her family about it. “Instead of judging me, they supported me throughout. The abuse is still something I’m dealing with.” Reitumetse said: “It hurts to see the people we trust hurt us. “It’s time women stand up and support each other.”
