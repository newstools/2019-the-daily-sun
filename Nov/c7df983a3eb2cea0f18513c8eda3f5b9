Makazole Mapimpi, the
first South African to score a try in a Rugby World Cup final, says the win is
a huge victory and motivation for the youth of the Eastern Cape, especially his
home village, Tsholomnqa. Mapimpi was speaking
during a media briefing after landing at OR Tambo International Airport on
Tuesday afternoon. When asked how he felt
after scoring the first try, the 29-year-old said: "It's amazing. I
couldn't believe it all night. "Mapimpi thanked
South Africa for rallying behind the team during the tournament, saying it was
because of this support they were able to come home as world champions. There are young boys who
saw what happened. I also couldn't believe that I would make it in the
Springboks team and World Cup, but it was a blessing [that I made it],"
the emotional winger said. He also thanked his family
for supporting him throughout his career. Right wing Cheslin Kolbe,
who scored the second try in the final, said crossing the white line was not as
easy as it looked. He added it was exciting
to win and the team was looking forward to celebrating the Webb Ellis Cup with
the rest of South Africa.Â "Thank you so much for the support. We really appreciate [it]
as a team and just to come back to South Africa to celebrate this moment with
each and every person is humbling. "We are back in South
Africa and we all here to celebrate this moment with each and every person no
matter where [they are]," Kolbe said. He added while the World
Cup was now over, a lot of hard work still needed to be done for future games.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/world-cup-win-a-victory-and-motivation-for-young-boys-back-in-ec-makazole-mapimpi-20191105
