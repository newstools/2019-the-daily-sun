WOMEN in the cheering crowd started screaming when he stepped into the arrival lounge! They were at OR Tambo to welcome the victorious Springboks home, but when Mapimpi appeared the ladies seemed to forget about everybody else. Tall, dark and super sexy Makazole Mapimpi (29), the hunky Springbok winger from the Eastern Cape, didn’t even have to show off his muscles or his magnificent six pack. He left women drooling and Daily Sun has been fielding calls from women who want a piece of him. “Iyoh! Lord have mercy! Amen!” said one caller. Ntombi Mkhize tweeted that she’d wear a doek and a mini blanket on her shoulders anytime for him. “I’m ready to be his makoti,” she said. “I’ve been single for seven years, but when I saw Mapimpi I knew this was the man the Lord has kept from me all these years. I’m ready.” On social media, some made it clear it doesn’t have to be marriage, as long as they can have a little bit of him. They’re even willing to leave their boyfriends for him – whether he’s married or not. “Yabona if he’s married I’d be disappointed, but that won’t change the fact that he’s my future husband,” Ashly tweeted. “So whoever is keeping him now can just keep him busy. I’m coming!” Matt Yonce said she can judge his performance by his arms. “Look at those veins on his hands! I just know he’s juicy like a ripe mango. I’m ready for you, Makazole,” said Matt. Sabelo Masiza is not so happy with the love wave that ladies are experiencing for the rugby star. “I hope he has a long-time girlfriend,” he said. “He musn’t date these ladies who come with a heatwave.” Buhle Mafani warned Mapimpi to stay focused on rugby. “Mamela ke chief. When you see any sort of woman, whether she’s young or old, bold or beautiful, just go past them like you don’t even see them,” he said.
