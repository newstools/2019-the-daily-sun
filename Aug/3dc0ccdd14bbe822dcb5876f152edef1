CITY of Joburg got a boost with a new fleet worth R247 million. The vehicles for different departments including City Power, Joburg Zoo and the Roads Agency were unveiled yesterday. Over 115 dedicated vehicles were handed over by mayor Herman Mashaba at Nasrec Expo Centre. The new fleet now sits at a total of 346, after another 231 were handed over before yesterday. Mashaba said the new fleet aimed to improve service delivery. “The vehicles will ensure city workers deliver services fast and efficiently. “New and sophisticated equipment means water workers can attend to burst pipes and leaks quicker. They will also assist in preventative scheduled maintenance.” Mashaba said his office was happy to provide workers with necessary equipment. “All our officials can carry out their duties in a safe environment. I encourage them to look after it to allow them to perform their many duties better,” he said. Mayoral committee member Valencia Khumalo said the new vehicles meant relief for workers who were using old equipment. Joburg Metro Police chief David Tembe said his department was happy for the new vehicles. “The recovery unit was boosted with brand-new tow trucks,” he said.
