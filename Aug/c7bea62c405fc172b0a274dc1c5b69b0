WIDOW Thulile Ntuli was found lying in a pool of blood in her shack last Sunday. And her family believed the 45-year-old from Dube, Soweto, was allegedly murdered by her Ben 10, who was apparently on the run! According to cops, a panga was found next to the body. Thulile’s family told Daily Sun it emerged after her murder that her boyfriend allegedly made public threats to kill her after they had an argument. Family member Velaphi Hlongwane (40) said: “Thulile lost her husband in December. I was shocked to find out she was in another relationship. I was bothered even more when I found out the person was way younger than her. “In the little time I spent with them, I could see he was very jealous. He used to tell her not to look at other men and she didn’t look happy.” Thulile’s brother Siphokuhle Basi (33) said his sister’s friends told him the boyfriend threatened to kill her with a panga. “Her body was found by our sister who went to visit her. She was covered in a pile of clothes. A copy of the boyfriend’s ID and a panga were lying next to her,” he said. “All his other things were gone. We believe he must have dropped the copy when he was packing his belongings.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Thebe said the motive for the killing had not been determined yet. “The family claims her boyfriend attacked her but there isn’t enough evidence to arrest him yet. A case of murder was opened,” she said.
