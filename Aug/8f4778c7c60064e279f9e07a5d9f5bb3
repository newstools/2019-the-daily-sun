ANTHONY Morgan went missing on Saturday after he was stabbed during an argument over a hubbly-bubbly pipe. Members of his family searched for him almost everywhere. Their worst fears came true on Tuesday when his body was found at the Pelonomi Hospital mortuary. The 25-year-old from Heidedal in Bloemfontein, Free State, was allegedly stabbed several times after demanding the pipe back from his friends. His aunt Patricia Morgan-Mashale said: “We learnt on Sunday morning that Anthony was stabbed several times, allegedly by his friends. He was attacked for demanding his pipe back. “When he tried to run away, they stabbed him all over his body and left him for dead. “He was taken to hospital. We thought we’d find him alive, but it was too late. “I’ve never seen so many stab wounds. Whoever stabbed him wanted him dead. His killers must rot in jail!” A witness told Daily Sun: “The fight started in a tavern. I saw Anthony quarrelling with a group of friends over his pipe. He was beaten and then stabbed.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said two suspects aged between 17 and 20 were bust yesterday. They will appear in court soon.
