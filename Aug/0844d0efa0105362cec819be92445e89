ERNST Middendorp hasn’t reacted kindly to talks that Stuart Baxter could be on Kaizer Chiefs’ radar. The tetchy Amakhosi coach nearly blew a fuse when quizzed about growing speculation linking the ex-Bafana Bafana coach with a return to the Glamour Boys. ”If Kaizer Chiefs has an idea to bring Stuart Baxter they should do it, thank you!” Middendorp said curtly. Baxter is back in the market after he resigned from the national team.And no sooner had he quit Bafana than talk of his possible return to either to Chiefs or SuperSport United began in earnest. But Middendorp is clearly not impressed.
