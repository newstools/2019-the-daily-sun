THE Ngxolo family yesterday thanked government for all its help. The family from Beachway squatter camp in Clermont, west of Durban, lost two members in a fire that burnt eight shacks. Family member Zinhle Ngxolo (27) thanked KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka after he visited them yesterday and handed over food parcels and blankets. Hlomuka also promised to help with burial costs and material to rebuild their shacks. Mum Samkelisiwe (17) and her kids Oluhle (3) and six-month-old Sanoluhle were killed in the fire on Tuesday morning. Zinhle said: “We are grateful for all the support we have received from our Councillor Sibongiseni Mkhize, who keeps checking on us and knocking on different doors to ensure we get assistance.” She said the family was hoping to bury the victims at their original home in Bizana, Eastern Cape. Hlomuka assured them the provincial government and the eThekwini Municipality would do all they could to make sure they got the support they needed. “The scenes that greeted us this morning are truly heartbreaking following the loss of three lives in such an abrupt manner,” said Hlomuka. He assured the fire victims the government would make sure they got new documents such as IDs so life could return to normal for them.
