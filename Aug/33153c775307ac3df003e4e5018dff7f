A SEA of kak has forced a pre-school to shut down and motorists to use alternative routes. About 67 kids from Red Location in New Brighton kasi, Port Elizabeth, are sitting at home. Principal of Khazimla Pre-School, Kholeka Mbusi-Nofemele (67) told Daily Sun: “It’s almost a month battling to breathe under these unbearable living conditions. “We have been turning kids away since last week Wednesday because we are scared for their lives. “The whole street is full of water and it is hard to even get into the school gate. Kids can easily fall and drown in this water.” Mbusi-Nofemele said they cooked for the children and allowed them to play outside. “But we cannot do that anymore because the kids will get diseases. “We reported this to our ward councillor and she came with municipal officials to witness the situation. They promised to fix the problem on Tuesday. But that has not happened and we had to turn 19 kids away,” said Mbusi-Nofemele. Resident Zola Faku (67) said: “I was born and bred here, but have never seen negligence like this. The water has even turned dark. “Parents have to go to work, but they don’t know what they must do with their kids because the crèche is closed.” Motorist Mzwandile Bandla (45) told Daily Sun: “This was a short cut to the Deal Party industrial area. But this sewage has spoiled everything.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Residents should report these problems on 0800 2050 50.”
