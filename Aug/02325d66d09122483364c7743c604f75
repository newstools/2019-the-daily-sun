EASTERN Cape Education MEC Fundile Gade visited Phakamani Senior Secondary School yesterday. This after two pupils at the school in Ngcobo were involved in a car accident on Monday. The two 18-year-old grade 10 pupils were on their way home when the vehicle they were travelling in overturned on the R408 road, killing them. It’s believed the vehicle was certified to carry seven passengers, but there were 12 people on board. Nine of the pupils were injured and were taken to All Saints Hospital. Gade called on all law enforcement agencies to crack down on overloading on scholar transport. “The deaths of pupils is very sad and disturbing news. We hope the families will find solace in God in this trying time,” he said. “My sincere condolences to the bereaved families, and I’d like to wish the accident survivors a speedy recovery. “I call on law enforcement to tighten their rules when it comes to overloading and speeding while ferrying our children. “We apologise to the family for what has happened.”
