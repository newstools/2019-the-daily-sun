SHE  recently appeared in popular soapies Isidingo, Generations: The Legacy and The Queen. Nonhlanhla Qwabe, known as Skolopad, said she was enjoying acting very much. The professional nurse from Bethlehem, Free State, told Daily Sun: “After the accident I was involved in, I needed to relax a little. “I thought of something to keep my brand alive and acting came to mind. I joined two agencies online and was happy when I was given some parts.” Skolopad said what she loved about acting was that your mistakes could immediately be corrected. “When I perform as a brand, people will not tell me during a performance that what I was doing was not the fight thing,” she said. “With acting, directors stop you immediately and you have to act again. There is more perfection in acting than when I perform on my own. “I have not been given a name on Isidingo yet and I’m just known as the landlady. I also took a part as a guest actress in The Queen and I enjoyed the roles. I promise my fans I will not disappoint them.”
