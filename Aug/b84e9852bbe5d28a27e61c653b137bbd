David Makhura and cops led Operation Okae Molao on the R55 in Sandton on Thursday
morning. The Gauteng
government said Operation Okae Molao will leave no stone unturned to fight
crime and restore order in the province. Several

nearest taxi ranks. Gauteng
SAPS Provincial commissioner Elias Mawela said the operation on the R55 was a
success. “Five taxis
were impounded, 14 undocumented people arrested, and fines were issued to
people found without correct documentation for driving,” Mawela said.
