She is used to putting one foot in front of the other doing
her mountains of work as former Public Protector, but Professor Thuli Madonsela
will be facing another daunting climb â€“ this time Africa's great equaliser. Madonsela on Sunday joined a team of climbers waved off for
the gruelling Trek4Mandela expedition up Mount Kilimanjaro to raise funds for
sanitary towels for school girls. They are aiming to summit symbolically on
Friday, August 9, in honour of Women's Day. The climb is a partnership with the Nelson Mandela
Foundation and the Imbumba Foundation and teammates range from media personalities
to corporate executives. Fellow climber Mari Van Wyk told SABC newsthat girls should
be given an equal chance to complete their education with their boy
counterparts.  One of their aims is to raise money for sanitary towels
because the lack of these products often make girls skip school during their
menstruation which causes them to fall behind on work. Imbumba's "Caring 4
Girls" programme also helps girls understand changes during puberty, and
gives them a voice on body autonomy and gender equality, according to the
website. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/madonsela-joins-kili-team-to-raise-funds-for-girls-dignity-campaign-20190804
