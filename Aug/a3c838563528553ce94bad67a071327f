ELDERLY residents in KTC kasi have been keeping busy by playing chess. Themba Matomela (73) said he and others from the area in Gugulethu, Cape Town, woke up early to play chess. “We wake up at 7.30am so that by 10am we’re at the place where we play chess,” he said. “We don’t only meet to play chess but to advise younger boys on how to treat women and become better men.” Themba said playing chess was a great way to relieve stress. “When we meet here, we don’t have to worry about our grandkids. We come here to relax and talk about life in general,” he said. Vuyani Ncayo (54) said when he joined the group, he didn’t realise they’d discuss things like women and drinking. “Even though I’m old, there are older people I’m still learning a lot from. I’m also passing knowledge to younger boys,” he said. They sometimes hold tournaments against people from as far away as Port Elizabeth. “We treat it like a sport. We sometimes play friendly games with players from Khayelitsha and other surrounding areas,” he said. “We’d advise older people to come and join because chess is really good for their health and they won’t have to sleep all day.” The group has about 20 members, and when they play tournaments the prize money is usually around R5 000.
