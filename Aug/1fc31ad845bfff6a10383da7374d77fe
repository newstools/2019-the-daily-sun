ENTREPRENEURS gathered in Bloemfontein on Saturday to get tips on how to improve their skills. The Engen Pitch & Polish workshop and competition took place at the President Hotel, and participants were taken through a pitching workshop by business expert, Justin Cohen. Since it started 10 years ago, the initiative has helped more than 15 000 entrepreneurs learn how to pitch their ideas to investors. This year’s event was made possible by the petrol company, Nedbank and Raizcorp. Delegates and the five competitors were taken through eight important aspects of pitching. The competitors were Neo Lesoka, Malani Modise, Puseletso Saul, Mpho Mosholi and Kedibone Tsiloane. Joan Njorage, brand manager at the petrol company, said: “Three of the contestants took home cash prizes while overall winner Kedibone will receive further training for the second phase of the programme.” If she wins the ultimate prize, her business will get a cash injection. Kedibone (29) from Sasolburg, who makes bricks from recycled plastic, started her business in 2013. “We employ seven people. Our plan is to expand the business and employ more people.”
