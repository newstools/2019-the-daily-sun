Police attached to Muizenberg SAPS were conducting observations in
a shopping centre when a suspect was overheard reporting that there was a police vehicle in the vicinity yesterday night. The Muizenburg police spokesman, Colonel Andre Taut said the
suspicious youth appeared to be very nervous and seemed to be on the lookout
for police in the area. “The member, Constable Julian Jacobs called for backup and
the station commander, Colonel Vassie Naidoo, who was doing crime prevention
patrols nearby, responded to the call,” said Taut. He said the SAPS members approached the suspect, searched
him and found him to be in possession of five 100g packets of tik, worth an
estimated street value of R150 000. “The suspect will appear in court soon,” he added.
