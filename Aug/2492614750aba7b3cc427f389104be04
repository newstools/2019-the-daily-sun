GANG wars are still raging in the Cape Flats, despite the deployment of the army two weeks ago. About 150 residents marched to parliament yesterday and demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa take action. “People are dying!” they sang. Protesters carried placards reading “Enough is enough” and “Cops are letting us down”. Avril Andrews, a leader of the protesters, said: “Our children are dying because of gang violence. “We want additional resources for social development. “Where is the army of social workers? “Trauma counselling should be available for victims of rape and other crimes in high-risk areas.” He said nothing had changed in the time the troops were deployed. Good party leader Patricia de Lille mingled with the protesters. She said: “While we have the interim response of the army and the police, let’s see programmes to deal with social issues.” She said the municipality had pumped millions into policing, but that this had not worked. “To just arrest people and fill up jails is not the answer,” said De Lille.
