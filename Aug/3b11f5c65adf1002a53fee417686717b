THE use of cable snares to entrap animals has become a major problem for the Kruger National Park. The park’s Johan de Beer said rangers seized thousands of snares this year alone. But in some instances they got to the snares too late to save the animals. “The snare is tied to a tree to ensure that once caught, the animal can’t escape. Once an animal is caught by the neck, it will most probably die,” he said. He said some of the animals were cut up into pieces while others, such as hyenas and lions, were sold to sangomas and for muthi. De Beer said most of the time, the animals were left to die on their own. “A buffalo was found after being snared for a year. The snare cut into the head and went down to the bone on the chin,” he said. He said most of the time, poachers set up snares on game paths where animals passed on their way to rivers. De Beer said the park had caught poachers, but not as many as it would want to. “You take a snare out today, tomorrow it’s back. If you catch a guy, the sentence will not be as long as it is with rhino poaching. I think it should be longer,” he said.
