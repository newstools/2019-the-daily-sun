MANY people wouldn’t be caught dead in donkey carts. They view them as an embarrassing and ancient mode of transport. For Jan Mashaba, however, donkey carts are a gold mine and a means to make good, clean money. The 23-year-old Jan from Bloodriver in Mmotong wa Perekisi, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, started using donkey carts at the age of 11 after his father Johannes died. The donkeys and carts belonged to his dad. “My father was the breadwinner. After he died it was only me, my little brother and our mum. I had to make a plan so we could have food on the table,” he said. That’s when the idea to take over his father’s business crossed his mind. He collects building and plastering sand from the river and sells it. “I charge R150 a load. Others hire me to collect garbage or pieces of bricks they don’t need after they’re done building.” He also ploughs fields, for which he charges R500 depending on the size of the field. Most of his customers are based in Seshego, outside Polokwane. “I’m happy I took over my dad’s business. I’m able to provide for my family, just like he did. Donkeys are good because they don’t need petrol. “You just let them graze and drink water, and that’s it. I’m not embarrassed using them because I know my purpose.” He has three young employees. One of them, Ally Ntini (20), said: “I enjoy working for Jan. The good thing about him is that he doesn’t cheat us. He pays us well.”
