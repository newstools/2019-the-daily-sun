SEXY singer Moonchild Sanelly always celebrates who she is and is not afraid to speak her mind. She wears whatever she is comfortable in. On stage she brings it on with her bright blue hair and personal dress sense – from her one-piece body suits to her fishnet outfits. Speaking ahead of the official start of this year’s Women’s Month celebrations, Moonchild said she stood for everything about sexual liberation. “Women can’t be liberated if they are not comfortable with who they are,” she said. She said people should look at the bigger picture and not her bum. “It’s about the fact that I’m not afraid to show the world who I am.” Moonchild, who describes herself as an advocate for female orgasm, said she did this so women were free to tell their partners what they want. “I’m a fierce woman who loves to have sex and I protect myself while doing it,” she said. Last week the star was featured on SABC1’s celebrity show, Real Goboza. D uring the interview with presenters Sam Ngesi and Sinazo Yolwa, she lifted her dress while twerking. “Beyoncé loves my bum, so everyone else can just go away!” said the Weh Mameh hitmaker. “If someone like her would consider working with me then no one else matters,” said Moonchild, whose real name is Sanelisiwe Twisha. The singer made headlines after she was featured on The Lion King: The Gift soundtrack. Moonchild and Busiswa were featured on the song My Power alongside Beyonce. She told the People’s Paper that the support for the song had been magical. “I have ticked the boxes on my three international collaborations, namely Beyonce, Gorillaz and Diplo.”
