PinkyGirl became popular after appearing on Bonanag’s show Being Bonang. As usual the TV presenters Nomuzi Mabena and Somizi Mhlongo, introduced them as their guests of the night and the show continued well and everything was going accordingly as planned till it was time for the interviews. Fans started questioning the awkward moments as PinkyGirl looked like she was sleeping when Somizi interviewed Lasizwe about his career and him travelling the world. Lasizwe was sharing about the privilege of travelling courtesy of YouTube and during that time, PinkyGirl seemed like she was not having it. Pinky looked sleepy and tweeps thought she was just not all about hearing Lasizwe share his side of the story.
