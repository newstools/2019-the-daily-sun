BAFANA Bafana’s African Nations Championships (Chan) misery continued yesterday after they failed to qualify for yet another edition. David Notoane’s makeshift side were dumped out of the first round of qualifiers by minnows Lesotho. They were subjected to a humiliating 3-0 defeat (6-2 on aggregate) by Likuena, as Lesotho are also known, at Dobsonville Stadium yesterday. Jane Ntso did the damage for the visitors, scoring a brace while Hlompho Kalake scored the third goal to send Lesotho into the second round of the qualifiers where they will face Zimbabwe. The victory was Likuena’s second on the trot against an opponent they hadn’t beaten in 24 years prior to the two legged encounter. Notoane made seven changes to the team that lost the first leg 3-2 in the Mountain Kingdom. Veteran midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane, defenders Nyiko Mobbie and Paseka Mako as well as striker Zakhele Lepasa were some of the notable inclusions. However, they could not produce a turnaround as they were left stunned by a spirited Lesotho outfit who meant business. The defeat, though, could be seen as a blessing in disguise as Chan is not part of the Fifa calendar and is generally perceived as a meaningless competition. The tournament only features locally based players in an effort to encourage international competition for players who would otherwise not be considered for national duty. Notoane had a tough time assembling a competitive squad due to withdrawals through injury and PSL teams not releasing their players.
