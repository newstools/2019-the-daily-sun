POLICE minister Bheki Cele said he wishes he was given
another ministry because being a police minister was a strenuous job. He was speaking at Sam Meyiwa's funeral in Umlazi in Durban
on Saturday. Sam who was the late Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goal keeper
died on Monday. He suffered a stroke. Cele said he was fully aware how Senzo's death impacted on
Sam's health. This job is a challenging one. Everyone is looking at you.
When people protest for water they asked where is Cele. When they kill one another
in taxis they ask where is Cele. I wish I was a minister of Arts, Culture and
Sports so that I can go and watch sports game not answering all these questions
of when you finding killers,"said Cele. He again promised to find Senzo's killers but said he won't
repeat the mistake of giving timeframes. He said he no case in the country that
has been given priority like Senzo's, adding it has been made number one
priority. He urged Mzansi not to put pressure on police about this case because
it wasn't the only case that has taken so many years. He made an example about
former police intelligence head Richard Mdluli's case which was took 20 years
to be resolved. Mdluli was found guilty of kidnapping and assault last week for
the case that happened in 1999. Some of the people that attended included Senzo's fiance
Mandisa Mkhize. All Senzo's kids came to pay their last respects to their
grandfather except Kelly Khumalo's child. Meyiwa spokesman Siyabonga Meyiwa
said Kelly was informed about Sam's death and the family thought she or anyone
will bring the child. Meyiwa was buried like a hero. His hearse convoy was
escorted by Metro police bikes and SAPS. He was laid to rest at Stellawood
cemetry.
