THE leader of a South Korean doomsday cult has been sentenced to six years in jail for holding her followers captive in Fiji and subjecting them to violence. Shin Ok-ju, founder of the Grace Road Church, convinced 400 people to move to Fiji in 2014, claiming they would be safe from a natural disaster. Their passports were taken away and many of them reported being beaten to “drive out evil spirits”. Shin was arrested last July. On Monday, a court found him guilty on violence, child abuse and fraud charges. Five other church officials were also sentenced. There has been no comment from the church. – BBC and REUTERS “The victims suffered helplessly from collective beatings and experienced not only physical torture but also severe fear and considerable mental shock,” said a sub-court of the Suwon District Court. “Heavy punishment is inevitable against illegal acts carried out in the name of religion,” it said.
