A TEACHER has been suspended after being accused of sexually harassing girls at school. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said they decided to suspend the teacher from Grosvenor Girls High School on the Bluff, Durban, pending an investigation into the matter. Mshengu said the department heard about the allegations on Thursday when the matter was being discussed on social media. Parents also protested outside the school on Thursday and Monday. The MEC said he sent a team of senior officials to the school to gather more details and investigate the matter. “I instructed that an internal investigation into sexual harassment allegations be conducted. The teacher has since been placed on suspension,” he said. “We appeal to complainants to provide any evidence during the investigation.” He warned that anyone found to have committed any wrongdoing relating to these allegations will be subjected to harsh disciplinary action. The school falls under the Umlazi district. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said on 26 July, 600 pupils at a school in Grosvenor disrupted classes after a 16-year-old girl was allegedly assaulted. “A case of assault was opened at Brighton Beach cop shop. No protest has been reported to the police since then,” he said.
