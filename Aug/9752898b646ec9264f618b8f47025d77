CAR enthusiast Thandukwazi Gcabashe from Klipspruit, Soweto, drives a BMW 320 model he bought in 2015. “It’s a diesel car,” he said. Q: Is it your first car A: No. I’ve owned a 1997 model Nissan Sentra, 2013 Nissan Juke and a 2004 Ford Fiesta, which is still around. Q: What do you love about your Beemer? A: It’s lovely, spacious, comfortable and powerful on the road. I use it as a family and everyday car. Q: What do you like about this car? A: Brand power. I could be driving it 10 years from now and it would still be as good-looking and considered a classic. And yes, it does have indicators and I use them all the time. Q: Is it your dream car? A: Not really, but I love my car so much. It’s still my favourite ride at the moment. To be honest with you, I don’t think I have a dream car. Maybe it hasn’t been built yet. Q: Would you allow another person to drive your car? A: Anyone, really, who is of driving age and is responsible enough to handle the power can drive my car. Cars are merely means of transport and should not be seen as anything more than that.If someone is responsible enough, then surely they can relieve me of the driving duties if I m tired or don’t feel like driving my car on a particular day. Q: Have you gone on long distance-trips in your car yet? A: Yes. I have driven it to many places in and outside Gauteng, and it has been very good to me.It gets us where we want to be fast and not tired at all. Q: Tell us about your choice of colour? A: White is a good colour to maintain. its an evergreen colour that transcends trends. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I have none so far. I’m a good and responsible driver. Q: What do you think of other drivers? A: I think we need to humble ourselves behind the wheel and give each other a chance. I see a lot of drivers taking selfies and videos while driving. I think we’re fast going down the wrong way.
