Rape-accused televangelist Timothy Omotoso received a double
blow on Thursday after a Home Affairs official gave him some bad news in the
High Court in Port Elizabeth, much to his amazement and that of his wife and
supporters.  Following his unsuccessful attempt to compel the State to
give further evidence in his rape trial, the surprise visitor told a stunned
Omotoso in court that his application to lift his prohibition as an illegal
resident in South Africa was unsuccessful.  His supporters demanded the official speak through his
lawyer, advocate Peter Daubermann.  Daubermann, however, declined and said: "I only
represent you on this [trial] matter."  As Omotoso left the courtroom, his supporters shouted:
"My Pappa, My Daddy! We love you Daddy."  Earlier on Thursday, Judge Irma Schoeman ordered that the
trial should continue on Friday as scheduled after denying the defence's bid
that the State be compelled to hand over more details of the charges against
Omotoso and his two co-accused, Lusanda Lusani and Zukiswa Sitho.  Judge Schoeman said the provision of further particulars
should be fair to both parties, adding the State could not provide particulars
if it was not known to them.  She was of the opinion that Daubermann was being
deliberately obtuse.  Following her ruling, Daubermann asked the court for a
further postponement so he could prepare for the trial on Friday.  Acting National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson
Sibulele Mboyi said it welcomed the judgment, adding it was always the NPA's
belief that it had handed over sufficient details.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/double-blow-for-omotoso-as-home-affairs-official-surprises-him-with-bad-news-in-court-20190801
