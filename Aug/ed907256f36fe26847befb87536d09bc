THREE Mzansi cities are among the top 50 most dangerous in the world. Johan Burger of the Institute for Security Studies said having more cops and army officers would not fix the problem. The Mexican Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice recently listed the world’s most dangerous cities in 2018 based on the number of murders. Cape Town ranked at No 11, with more than 2 000 killings recorded last year. According to the report, the city’s high murder rate was due to street gangs, drug lords, armed robberies and revenge killings. Burger said: “The high unemployment rate is one of the contributing factors. People are desperate and turn to substance abuse. They later commit crime, which often leads to death.” He said poor infrastructure such as bad roads should be attended to as it will make it easier for cops to patrol areas. Burger said Gauteng, which has the most aggravated robberies, is much safer because of its low murder rate. According to the report, last year the Mother City had a population of 4 322 031 and more than 2 868 murders. The army was recently sent to the area to support the police in bringing law and order. But despite this, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde earlier this week said 46 people were murdered over the weekend. This is an increase from 25 murders recorded the previous weekend. Nelson Mandela Bay is ranked No 45 with 478 people killed at a population of more than 1,2 million. It’s followed by Durban, which ranked 49 with 1 562 cases of murder and with a population of more than 4 million. Most cities which dominated the list were in Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela. Tijuana in Mexico is ranked No 1.
