KEVIN Silaule (28) says his famous muthi solves problems in the bedroom. Kevin from Cottondale, outside Acornhoek, Mpumalanga, claims his clients can’t stop praising him. “My customers tell me they are proud to be called men again,” Kevin said. He said his two muthis, called Washa and Extension, give sleepy 4-5s a massive wake-up call and leave the love machine ready for action for a long time. Kevin told the SunTeam he went with his madala, a powerful sangoma from Mozambique, to make the muthi in the bush. He warned customers to take the right dosage and use it only until their 4-5 was strong and the right size. “Women might run away if it’s too big.” Kevin said: “Even women tell me their men poke them and satisfy them with anacondas after taking the muthi.” Thandiwe Mona (40) said: “This muthi has turned my lover into a pro in bed. “Now, I’m scared some women may get a taste of what I get and want my man.” Customer Risimati Rikhotso (36) said previously he couldn’t last more than one round. “But now I can go on and on with my anaconda until my woman begs me to stop.” Traditional Healers Association co-ordinator Phephsile Maseko said if this innovation worked, the association would protect it after testing it. She said specialised healers had indigenous knowledge of using certain plants to grow 4-5s.
