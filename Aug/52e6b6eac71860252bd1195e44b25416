MAYOR Zandile Gumede’s supporters were dealt a blow in the Durban High Court yesterday. The court made the interim interdict granted last month against the marchers a final order after the embattled mayor’s supporters did not oppose it. The court had ruled that marchers should not be within 300m from the Durban City Hall and other municipal offices around the city. They have also been interdicted from intimidating municipal staff. The leader of Gumede’s supporters, Mzo Dube, said they were not bothered about the case as the municipality’s application was referring to unknown people. He said the people who marched on 10 and 11 July were known ANC members, so there was no reason to oppose the application. Advocate Griffiths Madonsela, of from Strauss Daly, the law firm representing eThekwini municipality, said the order applied to anyone, whether ANC supporters or ordinary people, who might want to disrupt municipal services. “Anyone who disrupts municipal work in the mentioned buildings will be violating the court order. It doesn’t matter whether they come as party members or as individuals,” said Madonsela. The municipality applied for an interdict after marchers supporting Gumede brought the city to a standstill on 10 and 11 July. They were demanding she be allowed to return to her position after her 30-day suspension lapsed.
