 THE case of Manusi Mothupi, who allegedly stabbed a homeless man, was postponed again! The 40-year-old suspect appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court yesterday. The case was postponed to 19 August. Gauteng NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwane said: “The case was postponed and investigations are still ongoing.” Mothupi’s brother Oupa (45) told Daily Sun the matter was complicated. “The problem is that they keep changing his case. At first they said it was assault and now they say attempted murder. “The family is not happy with police investigations into the matter.” Oupa said he believed his brother was innocent and the case had too many loopholes. He said the case had also tarnished his brother’s and the family’s name. “We want to find closure. This should come to an end,” he said. Oupa said if his brother was found guilty, he should be charged like all other criminals. The suspect allegedly stabbed the homeless man in Muckleneuk in Tshwane in May.
