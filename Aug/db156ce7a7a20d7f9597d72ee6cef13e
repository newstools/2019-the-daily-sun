A BATTLE over land has caused a delay in the development of a crèche. Alfred Shange, owner of Sithuthukile Crèche in Melmoth, KZN, accused local inkosi Thandanani Zulu of blocking the development. Shange said a sponsor was ready to build more classes for the crèche, but the inkosi said the land belonged to him. “The sponsors pulled out as they said they can’t continue with building where there are unresolved issues,” he said. He said the crèche was built in 2005 and the inkosi never claimed the land. Daily Sun called inkosi Zulu who asked his senior induna Lucky Zulu to respond. Lucky said: “Shange only came when they were ready to start building. He told the inkosi without asking him for permission to build.” He said in the meeting, Shange’s brother said the land was given to inkosi by their late father as a token of appreciation. One of the land owners, Senzo Shange (40), said: “The land belongs to the Ndlela and Shange families. Our problem is Alfred’s approach to the inkosi and he does as he pleases as if the land is his only.” Traditional Affairs spokesman Lennox Mabaso said the department will visit the area to find out what’s happening. Shange told Daily Sun he does not have to report every move he makes at his crèche to the inkosi.
