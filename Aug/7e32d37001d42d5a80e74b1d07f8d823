ANGRY parents shut down Nkululeko High School in KwaNobuhle kasi, Uitenhage, yesterday morning. They are demanding that prolonged building of the new school be completed. They ordered the teachers and pupils to get out of the incomplete school. They burnt tyres in front of it and on the street. More than 1 000 pupils joined the protest. SGB member Tantaswa Mafu said they were gatvol of empty promises. “Where is the R60 million meant to be used to build a new school for our kids? The building started in 2016 by a contractor from the North West. But this project has brought us a headache instead of joy,” said Tantaswa. She said the contractor only worked for six months. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: “We’ve spent 70% of our budget. We ordered the contractors to slow down until we get funds from Treasury. “We call for calmness and for parents to allow teaching and learning to take place while we’re exploring other avenues to get funds.”
