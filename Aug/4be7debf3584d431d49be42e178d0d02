Media personality and businesswoman Bonang Matheba has amassed millions of rand through business ventures and TV work. The 32-year-old reality TV star continues to make money in showbiz and she says she will not share her hard-earned moola with any man. Responding to a tweep, who advised her to marry out of community of property and keep her money in a trust, Queen B said she wouldn't allow nobody to get their "paws on my millions". The star recently revealed that viewers of her show Being Bonang will not see her on the show again, as she will not have another season after this one. Her fans went into a frenzy when season three of her show recently premiered on 1Magic, but   the  excitement was short-lived when she later announced that this would be her last season.
