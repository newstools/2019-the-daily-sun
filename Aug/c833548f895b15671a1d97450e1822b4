RESIDENTS woke up on Tuesday to find dogs feasting on slaughtered cows’ remains. Three cows were stolen and slaughtered in the open veld in Umbumbulu, south of Durban. Mbongeni Mkhize (67), the owner of the cows, said he left his 24 cows to graze in the veld on Monday and planned to pick them up the next morning. “When we arrived we found three were missing,” he said. “Later that day I got a call saying cow heads, feet and chests were found in Umbumbulu. “We got there and realised they were my cows.” A resident told the SunTeam it was tense in the area after the discovery. He said there was a problem with cattle theft three years ago, but it had stopped. “Cows roam on their own. In the morning they leave their homes and go to the veld and return in the night,” he said. He said thugs took advantage of people’s trust. “We suspect those responsible are people from the area feared by everyone. They slaughter the cows, put them into their van and drive away.” He said even goats were not safe. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said residents found the remains of three slaughtered cows in a forest. “It’s believed the cattle were stolen. A case of stock theft was opened and the Pietermaritzburg stock theft unit is investigating,” she said.
