WELL-KNOWN musician Selby Hiliza, aka Masheleng (38), allegedly shot a businessman twice on Monday. Luckily, the 52-year-old victim from Bloemfontein survived the attack and the artist handed himself over to the cops the next day. Masheleng, whose song 051 was a hit in 2013, faced an attempted murder charge in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Provincial NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping said he was granted R10 000 bail. Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane told Daily Sun: “An attempted murder case was opened after the shooting at 6.30pm on Monday. “The 52-year-old victim claimed he was shot by someone known to him while sitting alone in his car. “He told the police four shots were fired and two hit him in the right thigh and abdominal area. “The 38-year-old suspect handed himself over to the police. A licensed 9mm pistol belonging to the suspect was used in the shooting.” Shuping said Masheleng was due to appear again on 30 August after appearing in the magistrates court this week.
