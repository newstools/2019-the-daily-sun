PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s lawyer Dali Mpofu couldn’t believe President Cyril Ramaphosa had said he couldn’t discipline Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The North Gauteng High Court yesterday was hearing whether Ramaphosa was obliged to act on Mkhwebane’s instruction to take action against Gordhan, who approved an early retirement payout to former Sars deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay. The public protector found Gordhan was not authorised to approve the early retirement with full benefits for Pillay in 2010, when Gordhan was finance minister. Sars later reappointed Pillay in the same position on a fixed-term contract. Mpofu said Ramaphosa couldn’t postpone the execution of remedial action as Gordhan was challenging the report. He said it was incorrect for Ramaphosa to say he complied, when he had not implemented the action. Mpofu said the application was a mess: “This must be some kind of a joke.” Ramaphosa’s lawyer Hamilton Maenetje said the president was not in breach of the remedial action, because there would be discipline in the future. “We see no basis for the court to refuse this application.” He said remedial action directing the president to take disciplinary action against the minister interfered with the president’s executive powers. “No prejudice will be suffered if the stay is granted but there will be prejudice if it is not granted.” He asked the court to grant the stay and wait for the review application to be concluded. Gordhan’s lawyer Michelle le Roux said it was impossible for the president to decide on disciplinary action against Gordhan, and if the review succeeded remedial action won’t be necessary.
