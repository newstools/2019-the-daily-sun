A MAN bitten by a snake got his revenge on the reptile by biting it back, and killing it. Raj Kumar was relaxing at home and enjoying a drink when a snake slithered into his house in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and bit him. “A snake bit him. So in turn he bit it and chewed it into pieces,” said his dad Babu Ram. The man’s family took him to hospital, where he was reported to be in a critical condition. The reptile was a rat snake that experts regard as usually not venomous. “I’ve seen people coming in with snakebites. Never somebody who bit a snake and brought it with him in a bag,” said Dr NP Singh. – REUTERS
