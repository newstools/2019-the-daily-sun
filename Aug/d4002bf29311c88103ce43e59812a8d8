MORE than 31 small farmers received 600 bags of fertilizer on Wednesday. The bags were donated by the Mpumalanga Agriculture, Land and Environmental Affairs Department. The farmers are members of Varimi va Bush Secondary Co-operative in Bushbuckridge. Ehlanzeni North district director Hendry Ndlovu said the department wanted to ensure that farmers got help to improve their products. Obed Mokoena, chairman of the co-operative, said they were grateful to the department. “We really appreciate the boost. We’re happy that the donation came just in time, before the rain season. “Our soil is poor in terms of crop production, and this boost came in handy. The department also gave us three tractors for ploughing, dazing and casting rows. “Hopefully, this will help us sustain our farming project and produce fresh and quality products.” Gogo Albinah Sekgobela (67) said this was the beginning of great things to come. She thanked the department for the donation.
