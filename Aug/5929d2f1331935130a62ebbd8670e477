THEY were relaxing in their house minding their own business when disaster struck. The floor started cracking and water seeped into the house after a water pipe underneath it burst. The Seopa family from Hospital View, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, said they didn’t know their house was built on top of a water pipe. Francinah (44) said the family of seven were lucky the incident didn’t take place in the middle of the night, otherwise her young children would have probably drowned in their sleep. “We ran around the house trying to prevent blankets and beds from getting wet, but the water levels kept on rising. My children’s school books and uniforms were also soaking wet,” she said. Polokwane municipality’s disaster management unit was called to rescue the family. Francinah’s neighbour Julia Riba also rushed to help the family. Franscinah said she and her neighbours were concerned about the problem. She said their houses always showed signs of dampness. “We’ve had water problems since we started living here, but we didn’t know our houses were built on top of water pipes,” she said. Ward committee member Jack Sephuma said he knew about the water problem but was shocked to hear a water pipe burst under a house. Polokwane municipal spokesman Thipa Selala said the municipality would send a team to the Seopa house to investigate. He said this would help the municipality to determine how to help the family. “We want to establish what really happened,” he said.
