Dear MizzB  I am a 19-year-old girl and I broke up with the man that I really love after a two year relationship. The relationship ended because he kept on cheating on me. I now find myself dating a lot of guys to forget my ex but I still cannot get him out of my system. I do not want to sleep around just to forget the past but I cannot help myself. Please help Hey Lady Dealing with the end of a relationship can be emotionally taxing for anyone especially when the partner that you were with was unfaithful to you. However, it is important to take time out after a break up to heal. Remember that as a woman it is important to harvest the greatness in yourself that you want to attract in others. The biggest gift that you can give yourself is to be comfortable with who and where you are so that you can be a magnet of what you want to have. I have so much more to share with you just send a ‘Please Call Me’ 0833231023 or email: mizzb@lovelife.org.za
