THERE’s finally some good news for nurses! The Gauteng Department of Health has apologised to them for paying them low salaries and promised to fix the matter. The department said since more than 600 professional nurses were appointed at the beginning of the year, they have been paying them students level salaries. They were appointed to serve as community service nurses. The apology came after a team of senior managers handed over a memorandum of grievances to the head of department Mkhululi Lukhele last week. At the time, Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku said the treatment was unacceptable. He expressed appreciation to the nurses for not disrupting services while they were dissatisfied. The department said Lukhele recommended that the nurses be paid their outstanding money and be absorbed into the department. Acting head of human resource Dr Sipho Senabe said: “The department appointed 678 professional nurses to serve their compulsory community service before they could practise independently. “The department failed to pay them level appropriate salaries for professional nurses, but paid them on students salary levels. “We therefore unconditionally apologise for such unacceptable treatment of nurses.” Senabe said the change of these nurses’ appropriate posts would be done by the end of this month. He said they would also receive backdated payments with benefits.
