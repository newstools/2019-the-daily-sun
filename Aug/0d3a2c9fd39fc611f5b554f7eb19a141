THE best weapon you can have against any disease it to get tested, know your status, and get treatment as early as possible. Yesterday was World Hepatitis Day, as declared by the World Health Organisation in honour of US physician and Nobel Laureate Dr Baruch Blumberg, who discovered the hepatitis B virus Hepatitis is the inflammation and infection of the liver. Sufferers may be diagnosed with acute or chronic hepatitis. There are five types of hepatitis – A, B, C, D and E – with A and E being short term (acute) and B, C and D long term (chronic). Yesterday, more than 100 countries promoted events and activities that engaged citizens to better understand hepatitis, causes and available medication and treatment of the virus. Much like HIV or hypertension, most people are unaware they have contracted the virus unless they do a blood test. The City of Joburg has urged residents to do a blood test at its healthcare facilities, doctors’ rooms or pharmacies. According to Doctor Anna Sparaco, specialist surgeon at the Donald Gordon Medical Centre, initial symptoms of hepatitis are flu-like and may include diarrhoea, fatigue, loss of appetite, mild fever, body aching, abdominal pain, vomiting and weight loss. Worsening is indicated by the presence of circulatory problems, dark urine, dizziness, enlarged spleen, headache, itchy skin, light-coloured stool, yellow skin, yellow whites of the eyes and yellow tongue.
