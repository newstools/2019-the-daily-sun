JUSTICE and Correctional Services deputy minister Phathekile Holomisa visited Groetvlei Prison in Bloemfontein on Tuesday. Holomisa was accompanied by Free State and Northern Cape Regional Commissioner Subashini Moodley. Holomisa said: “Inmates must learn and get skills, so they can benefit them and their families when they get out. There are a lot of skills and labour idling in most of our centres, therefore, they must be used in order to maintain the facilities. “There is no need for us to employ people from outside to do work residents of the centres are in a position to do.” He said they also visited Heidedal Afterschool Care Centre. “This facility has been supported by correctional services. “Parolees and probationers were given resources in the form of computers and we also donated R20 000 in partnership with Nedbank. “The centre is for vulnerable youth who came from broken families. They are looked after and given meals when they come back from school. “They are also given computer skills and leather making training and so they can earn some money to support themselves,” said Holomisa.
