Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale is concerned about the high rate of drug abuse and dealing in Limpopo. “Drugs destroy lives. The youth are hardest hit by the scourge due to an increase in the amount and availability of different forms of illicit drugs,” she said. Rakgoale was speaking at Kgapane Community Hall on Tuesday. “It is estimated that up to 60% of crimes committed in the country involve substances abuse, and 80% of male youth deaths are alcohol related,” she said. Tzaneen police cluster commander Major-General Maggy Mathebula urged communities to stop protecting dealers. “Drugs are taking away our future leaders,” said Mathebula.
