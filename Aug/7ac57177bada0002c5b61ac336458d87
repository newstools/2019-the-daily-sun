#ThowBackThursday - Brandon "Sgcebezana" Silent. By KGOMOTSO MOKOENA Brandon Silent was tireless, dedicated and a true soldier for the Buccaneers. He was nicknamed "Sgcebezana" (Mini Skirt) because of his short stature and a lack of height. But he was fearless and won many battles in the heart of the midfield. He played more than 250 matches for Orlando Pirates and was also a part of the Class of 1995 that won the Caf ChampionS League. In 2013, Silent, who earned five caps for Bafana Bafana, backed the Buccaneers to emulate their class that included the likes of Jerry Sikhosana, Gavin Lane, Edward "MaGents" Motale, John Moeti, Mark Fish among others - but it was not to be as Al Ahly won the Champions League. Said Silent at the time: "I can't describe the feeling of winning this cup. I don't know about the others, but for me, I still feel the effects even now." Silent joined Pirates from Vaal Reef Stars and went on to play about 270 games, scoring 22 goals, before retiring at the beginning of the 2003-04 season. He played both as a right-sided midfielder and a right back at Pirates.
