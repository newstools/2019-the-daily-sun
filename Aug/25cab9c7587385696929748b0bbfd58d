By AFTER Daily Sun published the story of women who had built houses for themselves, they received many calls from people who want to join them. The women started a stokvel to build houses and so far they have built five. The story was published on 14 March. Ntombekhaya Nyama-Plati the, chairwoman of the Masakhe Ladies Stokvel based in Gugulethu in Cape Town, said people learnt about them through the People’s Paper. On Tuesday cement company, PPC, taught them about brick-making. “We want to make our own bricks, instead of buying from other people,” said Ntombekhaya. Group member Nobantu Kenya said they had about 30 women in the group. “More people want to join us, so we will start a second group,” said Nobantu “Having big companies like this supporting our vision shows they want to give back to the community,” she said. Each member contributes to R2 500 per month. The cement company’s area manager Peter Max praised the stokvel women’s hard work. “We’re doing this so the women can save money and make their own bricks,” he said. “We’ll be donating a machine and a container to the group. We’re going to their site to train them further,” said Max.
