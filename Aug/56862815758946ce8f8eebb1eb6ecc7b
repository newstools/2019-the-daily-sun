TSHEPO Ntimane will spend the rest of his life behind bars. His name will also appear in the national sex offenders’ register. The 31-year-old from Hokwe Village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, was sentenced to life imprisonment when he appeared in the Mhala Regional Court in Thulamahashe yesterday. He had pleaded not guilty to raping a 12-year-old girl in 2017. The court earlier heard that the victim had attempted to commit suicide. She said she would try to do it again if Ntimane was released on parole. But Ntimane told the court he wouldn’t change his “not guilty” plea and maintained he didn’t commit a crime. He said his four children would suffer if the court sent him to jail. He said he had a chronic illness and was on treatment. Prosecutor Kedibone Bareng told the court Ntimane didn’t show any sign of remorse and maintained his innocence after social workers interviewed him. “The victim was defenceless. A family friend, Ntimane took advantage of her. We, therefore, ask for a minimum sentence of direct imprisonment,” Bareng said. Ntimane’s lawyer, Lucas Hlungwane, pleaded for his client to be given a sentence that would give him hope to return to society and be a better person. Handing down the sentence, Magistrate Elmarie Theron said Ntimane’s explanations were worthless and his action showed he wasn’t suitable for a suspended sentence.
