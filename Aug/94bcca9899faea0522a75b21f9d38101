TSHWANE municipal workers yesterday vowed to continue their strike until they got an 18% salary increase. The angry workers said if no agreement was reached with management by the end of today, the Pretoria CBD would become a no-go area. Over the past few days, striking workers have been blocking roads with city vehicles. Samwu deputy regional secretary Valentine Matlala said they would continue protesting until their demands were met. Shop steward Charles Makgoka said: “Today we’ll make sure we take the strike to another level.” Municipal workers not in management positions were striking. They said their salaries had not been increased since 2017 when the city went from being a level nine municipality to level 10 and that there should have been salary hikes with the reclassification. Municipal spokeswoman Omogolo Taunyane said talks with unions were still under way.
