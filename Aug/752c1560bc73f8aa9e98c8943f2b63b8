Hey MizzB I’M a 22-year-old woman who recently got a job. My supervisor tried to get me to sleep with him, but I refused. Since I rejected him, he’s been making life at work difficult for me. I was forced to lodge a complaint against him because I’ve got evidence of his behaviour. Now my colleagues are unpleasant towards me, and I’m forced to work with him until late at night. I fear for my life. Hey Lady I applaud you for having the courage to report sexual harassment in the workplace. Courage doesn’t mean you not afraid. It means not letting fear stop you from doing the right thing for yourself. Your workplace is not acting in a professional manner on this matter. It’s important to take it up to a person in charge or a national labour relations agency so this unhealthy behaviour can be stopped. Get yourself professional counselling to help you deal with the trauma you have faced. You can also send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023, or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za and we will contact you.
