MEISIE’S family wants justice after she suffered 90% burns to her body last Monday. They believe the partner of Meisie Ntandane (30) from Ga-Rankuwa’s zone 3, north of Tshwane, is the reason she was fighting for her life in hospital. According to her sister Gontse Ntandane (28), Meisie complained he abused her. “But she never reported him because she hoped he would change.” Gontse said her sister told them last Monday it was hard living with her husband. “She told me they had been living with his side chick for two weeks. I took her halfway home after comforting her,” she said. She said soon afterwards, neighbours called to tell her that her sister was on fire. “I found her naked in the road. Her flesh was falling off her neck down to her feet , as if she was burnt by acid.” She and her father Ephraim (53) rushed Meisie to Dr George Mukhari Hospital. “On the way there, she told our father she burnt herself,” Gontse said. But they did not believe her and reported the matter to Ga-Rankuwa Police Station. “Cops refused to open a case. They told us they would wait for my sister to recover and hear her side of the story.” Meisie’s partner told Daily Sun they had issues like any other couple. “I cheated on her because she refused to sleep with me for two months.” He said: “She was in the kitchen and I heard her screaming. That’s when I found her in flames. I got burnt when I tried to put out the fire.” Captain Matthews Nkoadi said it wasn’t true that cops refused to open a case. He said an inquiry was opened as the victim said she burned herself. “But the matter is under investigation. A case of attempted murder will be considered when full information has been gathered.”
