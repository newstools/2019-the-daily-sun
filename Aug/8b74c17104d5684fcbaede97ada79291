A BREAKDOWN is never a pleasant experience. Therefore, it is important to keep your car ship-shape. Three issues that can lead to a breakdown: Alternator faults Although starter motors are usually tough and robust, they fail eventually. And, if you get your car serviced regularly, any potential faults would get picked up before they cause major problems. If you experience persistent battery problems and dim headlights when your engine is idling, you could have a fault with your alternator. If your ignition warning light comes on and the engine temperature rises quickly, the belt that drives the alternator and water pump could have broken. This is a serious problem and you should attend to it promptly by calling a breakdown service or the AA. Fuel problemsPPut the wrong fuel in your engine? It happens more often than you think. The most important thing to do is not to try to drive the car. The car will have to be towed to a service centre, where the fuel will be drained and flushed out. Clutch cables In a manual car the clutch cable is under a lot of stress. Get it checked if you notice changes to the way the clutch feels when you press the pedal. If your clutch cable breaks, pull over in the nearest safe spot and call for help.
