FINALLY, the National First Division (NFD) now has a sponsor, Premier Soccer League (PSL) has announced. On Thursday morning PSL chairman Irvin Khoza announced GladAfrica as the new sponsors of the NFD for the coming five years. The South Africa’s second-tier league‚ which has been without a sponsor for a number of years‚ will now be known as the GladAfrica Championship‚ where the winners will pocket R3-million, with runners-up getting R1.5-million and third-placed finishers R1-million. Making the announcement on Thursday and also confirming that plus 12 matches will be live on television‚ PSL chairman Khoza said the league is delighted to be partnering with a black-owned South African organisation. “We are naturally pleased and appreciate GladAfrica’s visionary leadership’s recognition of the strategic fit in anchoring a developmental football property that the National First Division is,” Khoza said. “GladAfrica is in the built environment business. “These are Engineers, Project Managers and Environment Experts that understand that sound foundations and particular attention to sustainability are indispensable for the future.” “The National First Division matches and delivers the build and sustainability offering that GladAfrica delivers to our nation.”
