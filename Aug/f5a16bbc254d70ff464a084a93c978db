LAMONTVILLE Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela has challenged his team to produce attractive football that the club’s fans will enjoy. Komphel will have his first full season with the Durban-based outfit this season. Abafana Bes’Thende were known of playing attractive and Kasi football under former coach Manqoba Mgqithi. The now Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach, who had skillful players such as Njabulo Manqana, Philani Shange, Thokozani Mshengu, made history with the club. They crushed Ajax Cape Town 6-0 when they claimed the MTN8 in 2009. It is still today the biggest scoreline in any final in the PSL era. Said Komphela: “Arrows should play the Arrows way. Free spirit, good football, people must enjoy the game. Part of football is to entertain, and win matches of football." Arrows were entertainers this past weekend when they were victorious in KZN Premier’s Cup by defeating Real Kings in the final. New signing like Ntsako Makhubela was show boating with tricks and flicks, something that pleased the masses from the stands. “We want fans when they have attended Arrows games, he or she leaves and say, my goodness, I had fun. We want them when attends Arrows matches they must see one or two things they can take home. “When the game ends, he or she should says, ‘no, the game ended early while I was having fun.’ "I also want the players to have fun and also us as coaches. If we can achieve that, then I’m sure we would have done something.”
