THE island between two busy roads is meant for pedestrians to walk on. But islands are now targeted by taxis that want to beat rush hour traffic. Traffic cops were made aware of these taxi drivers, who also bully pedestrians. After the SunTeam arrived at Fort Street, near the old Ramkraal prison, in Bloemfontein, yesterday morning, three minibus taxis had been stopped by traffic cops. One cop said the taxi drivers did not want to be patient on the road. “We received complaints from concerned motorists. They said the taxis were driving on the pedestrian pavement in the morning and afternoon rush hour traffic. “We decided to investigate the matter and saw it with our own eyes. “That is unacceptable! We will make sure every driver obeys the rules of the road,” said the cop. Pedestrian Thabang Lesemelo (30) from Batho kasi in Mangaung said he used the road daily. “I walk to and from work using this road. Last week, I saw one of the taxis almost hit a gogo on the pavement. “This is very dangerous and should be stopped. I wonder why passengers do not tell the reckless drivers to stop risking their lives,” said Thabang. Free State traffic spokeswoman Hillary Mophethe confirmed that police went to investigate the matter. She told Daily Sun: “Taxis are driving on the pavement meant for pedestrians. The officers acted after a tip-off and three taxis were impounded. “All should obey the law and not endanger the lives of passengers.”
