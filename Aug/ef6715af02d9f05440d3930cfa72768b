STUART Baxter on Friday resigned as Bafana Bafana head coach bringing an end to a turbulent second spell in charge of the men's national team. Baxter was appointed on 4 Ma 2017, and was handed a five-year contract until June 2022 with the mandate of guiding Bafana Bafana to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. SAFA confirmed that Baxter was yet to hand in a performance report on the African showpiece and instead headed immediately to Sweden on holiday. The 65-year-old though has a poor record at the helm with a win ratio of just 38% having overseen 21 games in charge. He also guided his side to the quarter-finals of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, with Bafana however scraping through to the knock-out stages as one of the best-placed third-place finishers. After a shock 1-0 win over Egypt in the last-16 many had felt that Baxter had saved himself from receiving the sack as he had come in for fierce criticism from the public and media. On their return to SA from the AFCON tournament, a fiery Baxter in a heated press conference almost dared the SAFA top-brass to fire him. "I have no problem leaving this job‚ don't confuse me with a coach who is desperate for a job," Baxter said. "I am not a desperate coach who says‚ please don't sack me‚ please."
