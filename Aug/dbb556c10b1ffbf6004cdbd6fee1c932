STRONG wind destroyed some houses in Tsholomnqa Village in East London, Eastern Cape, last week. Resident Boniwe Nontshokovu (45) told Daily Sun: “We are now living in fear because the wind has not stopped. “Some houses do not have roofs because the wind blew them away.” She said they also feared the walls in their houses would fall on them while they were sleeping. “The wind caused some cracks in the houses. We do not know what to do. “We have been phoning our councillor to tell him about this problem. But he does not answer our calls. “We want the municipality to help us with material to rebuild our houses. “It’s very difficult for us to buy material because most of us survive on social grants,” she said. Councillor Vuyani Peter told the People’s Paper he only heard about the damages on Tuesday. “One of the community leaders told me about it. Disaster management is going to visit the area and do an assessment. “When there are things like these, people must report them quickly,” he said.
