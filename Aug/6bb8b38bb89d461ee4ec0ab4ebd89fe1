AFTER the murder of six women in Marcus Garvey last month, Rastas want to revive the area. Mthuthuzeli Joseph told Daily Sun the tragic incidents had left the Cape Town kasi’s Rasta community traumatised. “We’re a non-violent community, and what happened left us traumatised.” Mthuthuzeli said when the community first started everyone was a Rasta, but these days 40% of residents were not. “The tragedy made people see this place as a place of crime, drugs and violence, and we have to do something for people to see that they can still come here,” he said. Kenyatta Memela, a Rasta leader, said he felt government was not doing enough to support black communities. “There are no events supported by government, and even when people do it themselves they don’t get very far without government support,” he said. Kenyatta said he believed if young people had activities to keep them busy, the crime rate would drop. Asked about the deployment of soldiers to the Cape Flats, he said maybe things would change if they stayed in the area for a long time. “What will happen when they are gone?,” he said. “What’s happening in our areas needs a permanent solution so we don’t go back to where we started before they were deployed.” Kenyatta said after the murders they received messages from Jamaica asking them what had really happened. “They were worried but we told them we’d do a revival so that people knew Rastas in this area are concerned about what had happened.”
