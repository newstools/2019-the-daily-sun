The mother of a Mpumalanga man who was allegedly
killed by two farmers in Delmas wants his son's killers to rot in jail. Doctor Masilela (30) died after he was knocked down
with a bakkie and later shot twice on the head in June. His lifeless body was found dumped under a bridge, a
month later which is believed to have been the suspect's way of concealing his
death. Masilela allegedly went job hunting with his friends
on the day he went missing but, never came back. However, there are allegations that the trio went to
steal some beans at the farm belonging to the accused. Two suspects, David Lecordeur (56) and Garry Wiblin
(36) were arrested and charged with murder, defeating the ends of justice,
violation of corpse and assault GBH. The duo appeared before the Delmas Magistrates Court
on Thursday for bail application. Lecordeur's charges were withdrawn after he turned
into a state witness that led to the arrest of a 67-year-old man. The accused was arrested loitering around the court
premises, while the court was in session.
