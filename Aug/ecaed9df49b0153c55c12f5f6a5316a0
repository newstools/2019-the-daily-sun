The Soil will perform their a capella songs at The Lyric Theatre, Gold Reef City, in Joburg tomorrow. The group, which is made up of Buhle Mda, Luphindo Ngxanga and Ntsika Ngxanga, is hosting An Acapella Night with TheSoil, organised by Radio 2000 and Bassline Live. Ntsika told SunBuzz they intend to give it their all as they usually do. They are looking forward to taking fans down memory lane with songs people have loved jamming to since the group started. “We’ll perform old and new music we have been working on, to give people just a taste of what’s coming,” he said. “We don’t know why but when we perform on stage, we touch souls and find couples proposing to each other on stage. “We might be doing something good for people’s hearts and we hope to do the same tomorrow.” He said they believe they have succeeded in music in different ways and were grateful they could support their families and live good lifestyles. “We attribute our success to everyone who works with us and helped to make this happen, including our record label and management Native Rhythm Records, our families, friends and most importantly, the people who bought our music and come to our shows.” After working on solo projects, they’re about to record a fourth album. “We are due back in the studio soon and will be releasing our album at the beginning of next year. “Our fans should come out in their numbers to attend the show at The Lyric Theatre tomorrow to hear some of the new music.”
