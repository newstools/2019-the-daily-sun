THE latest Toyota RAV4 should have its competitors worried. This as Toyota has upgraded its rule book on styling. Like other new generation Toyotas, including the Corolla hatchback, the RAV4 has a daring design. And this is a winning formula, as the once-bland Corolla has been selling like hot cakes locally. Besides improved styling for the fifth-generation RAV4, Toyota has also upped the ante regarding interior design. On test was the range-topping VX model.  At first glance, it’s clear the RAV4 has more than one up on its predecessor. The last RAV4 was a bread van when compared to rivals like the Hyundai Tucson and VW Tiguan. But the new derivative poses a serious threat to them. Not only is it stylish and looks upmarket, it’s comfortable and practical too. SunWheels loves its solid build quality. The drive has improved, the car feels great.  With 152kW of power, the normally aspirated 2,5-litre petrol engine is powerful and eager. It really gets the job done. The eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel-drive make Mzansi’s tricky roads a joy to navigate. Overall, the RAV4 is a credible option in the very competitive SUV-segment.
