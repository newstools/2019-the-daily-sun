PULENG Lekoane has been fighting to have her younger sisters come live with her. The 25-year-old from the Ramaphosa squatter camp in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun her sisters lived with her aunt, after their mum died. But the woman, Puleng claimed, mistreats them. She claimed her sisters, aged 10 and 17, sometimes went around asking for money and food. “I’m not rich but I’m willing to suffer with them,” she said. Puleng claimed her sisters wore hand-me-downs. “Neighbours always shout at me, saying I look healthy and happy while my siblings are suffering. “They wear torn clothes. People also donate money to buy them school uniforms.” Puleng said she was worried about their safety. “If one of them is harmed, I won’t be able to live with myself. “My aunt lives with them for their grants.” Neighbour Gloria Mthembu (59) said she had shouted at Puleng a week ago, asking her why she was glowing while her siblings were dusty. “I gave the kids R30 for bread and gave them clothes. “Even if it’s not with their sister, they need to find a stable home.” Martha Mokoena (48) claimed she saw the younger girl roaming the streets at 10pm with cigarettes. Aunt Anna said she didn’t know what Puleng was talking about. “As far as I know, she’s not fit to be a guardian. Those kids are safe with me. “I do send them to the shops but not at night.” Social Development Department’s Busi Kheswa said Puleng would have to be assessed before she could take in her siblings.
