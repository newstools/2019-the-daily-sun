DOCTORS have removed 526 teeth from a seven-year-old boy at the Chennai’s Saveetha Dental College and Hospital in India. The denticles, or small teeth, were in a tumour in the boy’s mouth and removed on 31 July. “We’ve never seen this many teeth in any one site,” Pratibha Ramani, a professor and head of department of oral and maxillofacial pathology, told The Times of India. Dentists ordered an X-Ray and CT scan, which revealed a bag-like structure in the boy’s mouth that contained 526 teeth, P Senthilnathan, a professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Saveetha Dental College and Hospital, told the New Indian Express. The condition is known as compound composite odontoma. “The tumour-like growth prevented permanent molar teeth growth in the boy in the affected side. X-Ray and CT scan showed multiple, rudimentary teeth in a bag-like tissue,” Senthilnathan said. At that point, doctors determined surgery was necessary to treat the rare condition. His parents initially agreed to it, but it took several hours to convince the boy. Senthilnathan said they caught the condition in the early stages. The procedure, which required general anesthesia, took about an hour and a half. It took the surgeons five hours to remove the 526 teeth from the “sac”. – TIMES OF INDIA
