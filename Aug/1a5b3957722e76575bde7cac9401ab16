TSHWANE mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has apologised to residents following service disruptions during the municipal workers’ strike last week. “We’re assessing the impact of the four-day unprotected and illegal strike by municipal workers.” He said the impact of the strike had led to the municipality working hard to come to an agreement with Samwu and the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union. “It was not in the interests of resident not to reach an agreement and to allow the state of anarchy to continue. “Current assessments indicate a significant loss due to the disruption of services.” The mayor said departments which provided vital services were brought to a standstill at a huge cost to the city, residents and businesses. “Departments across the city will be given necessary support to make sure financial losses are recovered.”
