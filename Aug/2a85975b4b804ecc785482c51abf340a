ZIMASA Lukwe turned her sister’s death into something positive. The 50-year-old owner of Zim’s Kitchen and Party Decoration Company in Walmer kasi, Port Elizabeth, told Daily Sun: “My sister’s death in 2004 opened many doors for me. “Little did I know her funeral would be the beginning of a new and bright chapter in my life. “The hall where her funeral was held was plain and ugly. I decided to decorate it and everybody was impressed.” “I grew up watching my mother sewing at home. “She used to encourage us to take it seriously and learn how to match colours. It has always been my dream to be in this business one day.” After that, Zimasa soon had her own decorating business and has never looked back. “I decorate for family gatherings like kitchen teas, weddings, funerals and birthdays. My clients include abelungu, Nigerians and Ghanaians. “This makes me proud because it shows that my work speaks for itself.” Zimasa advised unemployed people to create their own jobs. “My sister left me with three kids but with the income from my business, I can provide and send them to school. “It’s time that we roll up our sleeves and create our own jobs. If we wait for government to do everything, we will suffer.”
