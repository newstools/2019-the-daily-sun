BAFANA Bafana Chan coach David Notoane has called up veteran midfielder Reneilwe “Yeye” Letsholonyane to help rescue them ahead of their second leg match against Lesotho. Bafana will host Lesotho in the second leg of their Chan qualifier at Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday (3pm). Notoane’s charges are heading to this encounter on the backfoot after losing the first leg 3-2 last Sunday in the Mountain Kingdom as Lesotho claimed their first win over Bafana Bafana in nine attempts and 24 years. Notoane who admitted disappointment as his charges conceded goals in the first five minutes of the match and the last five minutes says he’s looking at Letsholonyane’s experience to help the youngsters. The winner of the two-legged fixture will progress to the third and final round, with the first and second legs taking place from 20 September. Notoane explained why he roped in Letsholonyane: “We called Yeye, due to the situation that we are in. The PSL kicks off on the same weekend and it is difficult to get the players released by clubs. “We could not get Grant Margeman at Ajax Cape Town, Sipho Mbule, Teboho Mokoena of course we did not expect him because of the magnitude of the game that his club SuperSport United are playing (against Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday),” added Notoane. “We need a blend of experience and maturity, we are looking for that from him (Letsholonyane) to see if he can help take us through.” However, he admitted that he will see tomorrow if the 37-year-old former Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport star will be fit for the Sunday’s clash. “Even if we do not take him for the final squad the experience, he brings in to guide the young players will be valuable.”
