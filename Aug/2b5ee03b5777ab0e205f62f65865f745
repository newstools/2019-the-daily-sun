Eastern Cape police have applauded residents who traced and
chased two men aged 23 and 41 suspected of rape and handing them over to authorities
unscathed in spite of their anger. Spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said a woman was
dragged into bushes and raped while on her way to shops in Mhlamhlane Village,
Willowvale on Thursday. Shockingly, she was then raped by a second man. She managed
to identify the two and residents went to find them. "The two suspects were traced, chased and caught by the
community members," said Manatha. They were handed over to the Willowvale police where they
were charged with rape and will appear in court on Monday. Manatha said the provincial commissioner Lieutenant General
Liziwe Ntshinga was full of praise for the people who brought the suspects to
the police. "General Ntshinga thanked the community for not taking
the law into their own hands as the suspects were not assaulted," said
Manatha. Police have often expressed concern over "vigilante
justice" where people accused of crimes can be beaten so severely by angry
neighbours that they die. he community of Fort Malan Village in Willowvale did the
same in chasing and catching a 28-year-old man suspected of raping a woman who
had gone to visit her boyfriend on Friday. The woman had found her boyfriend
drunk and asleep but she was then attacked by a man and raped. She raised the alarm and neighbours found the suspect and
handed him to police, also in Willowvale.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/residents-applauded-for-tracing-rape-accused-without-harming-them-20190804
