NO history, no fans and no community. These are some of the reasons that  compelled Alan Norman to sell the status of his club, Maccabi FC to the Moroka Swallows owners. The Birds made a giant leap from the third tier to the National First Division this week, after the PSL approved the sale transaction between the two clubs. The Birds will be back competing in the now called GladAfrica Championship. All this, however, became possible after Norman agreed to sell his club.But why? ”The deal takes a team that’s been around for four years into a 100-year history. ”That’s the attraction of the deal. Now they've got to live up to the legacy. They have the community behind them. That was the motivation behind the sale. ”We don't have a community, we don't have a history. You can't buy those. It takes decade to build them. They have that. Our name, our brand is not relevant to the township and the supporters. ”They have been trying to make a comeback for a long time.”
