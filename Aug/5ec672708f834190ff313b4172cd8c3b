Orlando Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic says goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo’s unfortunate early retirement has come as a blow not only to the player, but the whole club. The 29-year-old shot stopper was forced to hang up his gloves due to “medical incapacity.” Khuzwayo suffered the ultimately career ending ankle injury during pre-season when he joined the Soweto giants from arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs in 2018. The former AmaZulu goalie didn’t manage to play even a single match for the Bucs first team in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). ICYMI: WATCH: BUCS GOALIE'S CAREER OVER! Speaking during a press briefing at the club’s training ground in Johannesburg, an emotional Micho described Khuzwayo as a “Zulu Warrior” who generated a positive energy in the dressing. “It is extremely emotional to talk about Brilliant,” said Micho. “As a kid, I grew in my country Serbia playing football and being part of a supporter’s group named ‘Zulu Warriors,’ I never knew I would come to a country called South Africa and meet a true Zulu Warrior. “We have had a magnificent time with him and made unbelievable memories. But it was terrible looking at him, knowing that he still had a lot to offer. “We knew what to expect from the player and we knew that he can deliver but on the other side that bridge between medical decision and our desire to field him couldn’t be ignored. “We always believed the time would come where we would have the opportunity to have him in goal, but unfortunately it was not meant to be. “Wherever he is, whatever he is doing, may the almighty God bless him in all of his future endeavours. He leaves great memories with us because he was a special character, he would always bring smiles on all ours faces. “Now that this door has closed, I know that many more doors and avenues to give back to football what it has given to him will open.”
