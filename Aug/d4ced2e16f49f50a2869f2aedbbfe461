PROTESTING municipal workers want to close all businesses operating in the Tshwane CBD! “We’ll make it difficult for anyone who wants to run a business,” said shop steward Charles Makgoka. He said they won’t go to work unless they got an 18% increase. On day three of their strike in Tshwane yesterday, municipal workers ordered all businesses to shut down. “We want business in the city to stop until we’re paid what is due to us,” Makgoka said. “We don’t care whether we are paid for the days on strike. Our concern is getting an increase.” Samwu deputy regional secretary Valentine Matlala said: “The workers want an increase of 18% backdated to 2017. The city owes workers already.” Mayoral committee member Sheila Senkubuge said they recovered the municipal buses seized on Monday during the protest. “The buses were removed from the depot and used to block streets.” Senkubuge said they got the buses off the streets and back to the depot with the help of police. “We registered a case because the buses were taken without permission. “We condemn the chaos that took place over the past two days in the name of protesting. She apologised to residents of Tshwane and all those who were affected by the illegal protest. “Negotiations with unions about the ongoing wage increase demands are expected to resume today at the National Bargaining Council in Centurion,” said Senkubuge. “We are confident that we will reach a solution.” Senkubuge said bus operations remained suspended until the deadlock could be resolved. City spokesman Klaas Mafomne said: “The matter is being dealt with by the bargaining council.” But the meeting between the city and unions, she said, was under way.
