THE family of Mbabazane Zibani (66) are trying to come to terms with his death. The Mkhwanazi trust chairman was ambushed outside his office at KwaDlangezwa on Wednesday by three unknown men. His younger brother Thembinkosi (63) said Mbabazane had gone to fetch something from his car. “Three men came from nowhere and shot him. They jumped into their car and raced off,” he said. Thembinkosi said the killers didn’t take anything. “We think his killing has to do with the land redistribution and compensation process.” He said President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the Mkhwanazi community in October to announce he was giving back more than 4 000ha of land. “The president also said victims were going to be compensated but never outlined the process,” he said. “When my brother was meeting beneficiaries, non-beneficiaries would cause trouble, telling him they also wanted money. “We think those who killed him may have thought he had something to do with the compensation money, which he didn’t.” Thembinkosi said the land matter was being dealt with by the land reform department . “All we want is to see the killers behind bars,” he said. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a 66-year-old man was shot dead at KwaDlangezwa at about 4pm on Wednesday by unknown men, who sped off in a car. “A case of murder was opened at Mtunzini Police Station for investigation,” Mbele told Daily Sun.
