BAFANA Bafana striker Percy Tau has made an incredible start to his loan stint at Club Brugges in Belgium’s Pro League and has immediately won over fans. Tau was on hand to score Brugges’ fourth goal of their second league match of the season against VV Sint-Truiden. Tau sprung the offside trap but had little time to work with goalkeeper Daniel Schmidt charging at him. The Bafana striker had ice running through his veins though, chipping the onrushing keeper to score his first goal for the Belgian club.After the match, Tau got the Brugges fans worked up again as he took up a microphone and introduced himself to the faithful by leading them in a few post-match chants. au was withdrawn in the 79th minute of the contest and is expected to feature in some capacity when Brugges take on Dynamo Kyiv on Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League Third qualifying round match.If Tau can help Brugges can beat last season’s Ukranian Premier League’s 2018/19 runners-up, he could find himself going toe-to-toe with the cream of European footballing talent. The winners of the clash will enter the draw for the 2019/20 Champions League group stage. The draw takes place in Monaco on 29 August 2019. UEFA have already determined the eight ‘top seeds’ putting Champions Liverpool into Pot 1 alongside two other EPL clubs in Chelsea and Manchester City. Real Madrid are excluded from Pot 1 but last seasons beaten semi-finalists Barcelona are present. Juventus, Paris Saint Germain, Bayern Munich and Zenit Saint Petersburg round out Pot 1.
