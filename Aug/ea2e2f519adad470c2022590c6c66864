GOGO Mahlangu (80) had been living in a tiny mkhukhu for 13 years. Life was tough as she had to share the one-roomed corrugated iron shack with her unemployed 20-year old grandson, Muzi. They both survived on her meagre old-age in pension. Things, however, began to look up for gogo this week when builders arrived at her home Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga, to lay the foundation for her new five-roomed RDP. The new home – which will consist of two bedrooms, a sitting room, kitchen and bathroom with a flush toilet – is one of 100 being developed in the area for needy residents. The R11 million housing project was launched by Mpumalanga Human Settlements MEC Norah Mahlangu. Gogo Mahlangu could not hide her excitement as the builders started work on the house. “I’m very happy to see my house finally being built. My life will change for the better. There will be enough space for me and my grandson to share. Rain and cold will no longer be a problem,” she said.
