COPS strategically withdrew from an operation targeting counterfeit goods in the Joburg CBD on Thursday. This came after a violent crowd of foreign nationals attacked police with bricks and petrol bombs. Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said due to the volatility of the situation, police retreated to avoid a situation where they would be forced to use live ammunition. “Of priority at this point was ensuring that there was no bloodshed or death,” Peters said. Peters said no cops sustained injuries, while two of the brand owners and one paramedic sustained serious injuries.  The Provincial Commissioner of police in Gauteng, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela condemned the never-ending undermining of the authority of the state by foreign nationals in the Johannesburg CBD. "Such lawlessness cannot be allowed to go unpunished," Mawela said. In her reaction to the incident, Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, MEC Faith Mazibuko said, "We condemn the attacks on police and members of other law enforcement agencies. We condemn all criminal elements hellbent on undermining the Rule of the law in this country and making this country ungovernable.” Mazibuko said: “We can’t co-govern with criminals, especially foreign nationals who want to turn our country into a lawless Banana Republic. Working together with SAPS, JMPD, Home Affairs and SARS Customs, we will conduct a joint operation in that area. “We will assert our authority and show ungovernable foreign nationals that there are laws in South Africa and they must be respected,” Mazibuko added.
