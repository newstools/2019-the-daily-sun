WHEN Apostle Regina Kgotleng said people hate the truth, Busisiwe Mkhwebane shouted “Amen!” Kgotleng was part of the pastors supporting the public protector at the Alive Alive Jesus Ministries in Klipfontein View in Midrand yesterday. A few ANC Women’s League members attended the service. “The enemy is roaring like a lion, but they are not the lion! So you should not fear. You are being persecuted for the truth,” preached the apostle. Directing her message at Mkhwebane, she said: “When things are tough, you must know God is testing you. God doesn’t choose just anyone.” She said Mkhwebane mustn’t fear. “The size of the pain is the size of the blessing. You must be a woman of integrity. Do not fear even if you live among the lions and the thorns, because God is on your side.” Mkhwebane said she’d come to seek comfort following painful, negative experiences from the media and politicians. “If I was not a praying person, I would not have peace. God will reveal the truth in time. God willing, I will survive the storm.” She said she wasn’temotional in interpreting the law, and it was cruel for the media to speak to her mum without her say-so. Archbishop Modiri Shole said the media was being used by politicians pushing their own agendas. “Busi is a child of God. I know she even prays for those who persecute her,” he said. At the end of the sermon, all the bafundisi prayed for Mkhwebane and her friends.
