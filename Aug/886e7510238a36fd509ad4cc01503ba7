DENZIL and his girlfriend had been together for 12 years but lately, according to neighbours, he had become aggressive towards her. This led to her leaving him on Saturday. And on Sunday, Denzil Scoble (29) from Homelite, Kimberley in the Northern Cape, decided to hang himself. Denzil’s body was discovered by a friend in the shack he shared with his girlfriend. Denzil’s grieving girlfriend, Trooi White, told Daily Sun about the last moments with her boyfriend. “We had a row because of the way he was behaving towards me. I told him I was leaving him and going home,” she said. “He told me if I do not come home I would find him dead but I thought he was just being dramatic.” “I slept at a friend’s house not far from our shack. “In the morning I learnt he had taken his life.” The dead man’s family didn’t want to comment as they were still in shock. A neighbour close to the couple said: “Their relationship started falling apart after Denzil started abusing his girlfriend. “I would often hear them arguing at night. “I knew one of them might go to jail or end up dead.” He said he saw Denzil sitting outside the shack on Saturday night. “I was shocked to learn the following morning that his body had been found,” said the neighbour. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Majang Skalkie said: “An inquest docket has been opened after a man was found hanging at his home.”
