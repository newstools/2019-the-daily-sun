THE trial of Walter Sisulu University student Sibongile Mani has
started at the East London Regional Court. According to the Daily Dispatch, there is still no answer as to
how R14-million was deposited into Mani’s account instead of the normal monthly
R1400 stipend. Last year the SunTeam reported that Mani (29) was arrested and
charged with theft following the June 2017 major blunder. The student made national headlines when it was revealed that her
sudden extravagant lifestyle of expensive booze, clothes and weaves. By the time the costly mistake was picked up, Mani had allegedly
spent R818 000. In court today, Intellimali director Roy Jackson testified that
the public protector, auditors Ernst & Young, and the department of higher
education and training (DHET) all investigated but could not determine who was
at fault.  The Dispatch further reports that within a few hours after the
millions were transferred into the account of student Sibongile Mani, R20,000
had been spent on “prohibited” items such as cigarettes, alcohol and electrical
appliances. “We don’t know how it happened but we have taken responsibility that
it happened on our watch,” said Jackson. The trial continues.
