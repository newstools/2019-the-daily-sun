TOP DJ and business man Oskido became a genie in a bottle when he granted a young man’s wish. Three weeks ago, Dzulani Sigodi (31) asked several celebrities to help him realise his dream of visiting Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. He wrote: “I am a self-made artist from Venda, Limpopo. I wish to see Moses Mabhida Stadium for the first time in my life. I’ll be the happiest man.” Oskido responded and on Monday, Dzulani was standing in the middle of the stadium, which he had previously made a model of using paper and boxes. On Sunday, he boarded a flight for the first time. Dzulani, from Tshipako in Venda, said he had wanted to see the stadium since 2008. “My journey to Durban wasn’t easy because I was really scared. Taking a flight for the first time isn’t easy, but I kept thinking of the bigger picture – the stadium,” he said. “When I got there, I cried in disbelief and was very happy to finally be there. I hope Oskido does this for other people who also come from poor backgrounds. “I pray to God to bless him abundantly.” Oskido told the SunTeam he was inspired by Dzulani’s talent. “After seeing his work on Twitter, I was impressed and thought I could help him because I work with Durban Tourism,” he said. “What made me really want to help him is that he’s from a disadvantaged background and I knew it would mean a lot to him. Helping him meant a lot to me.”
