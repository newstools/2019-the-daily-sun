Strange as it may sound. Bloemfontein Celtic don’t have a head coach, but permanent co-coaches! Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka will continue in their roles as “head” coaches in the new season, the club have confirmed. The two assumed the coaching reins when Steve Komphela quit last December, and have since impressed. But club CEO Khumbulani Konco says it is not that they can’t afford to hire a coach. “We have faith in the coaches. When a coaches leaves, it’s normal for the assistant to take over,” says Konco. “The assistants did fairly well and we’ve decided to give them a chance. Yes, they are permanent coaches. They work as team. It’s a working formula. ”Celtic have run into serious financial troubles that it’s actually a miracle that they are still afloat. But Konco further explains they have found their financial footing and ready for the new season. Siwelele will be looking to get off to a rollicking start when they visit Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (6pm), just like they did last season. “We’ve assembled a good team and are ready for the season,” Konco declares. “We always try to plan properly. It’s all about planning. Most people think we’ve released our regulars but they're still there. But go look at our team.”Any targets? “As always... to qualify for the top-eight  and have a good run in one of the cup competitions.“Last season is gone. It’s water under the bridge. We have our supporters back behind us.”
