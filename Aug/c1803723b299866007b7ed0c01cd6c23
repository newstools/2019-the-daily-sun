Khayelitsha mom Inga Mafenuka, who gave birth to quadruplets
last year, is still fearing for one of her children, after tragically losing
her son Bubele on Thursday morning. Mafenuka made headlines when she gave birth to two girls and
two boys at Tygerberg Hospital in July 2018. The children, Bubele, Buchule, Bunono and Bungcwele,
celebrated their first birthdays last month. 'Not breathing
normally' Family neighbour Stella Booi said on Wednesday evening that
the children's grandmother had told her that Bubele had been vomiting and had
been suffering from diarrhoea throughout the day. After spending the day with the family, Booi said she left
the family home just after 21:00 on Wednesday evening with all four children
playing happily. "At 07:00, I received a call again from the children's
grandmother who said Bubele is not well and, when I arrived, I saw this too -
he looked pale and was not breathing normally," said Booi. After waiting for an ambulance for close to an hour, Booi
says they enlisted the help of a neighbour who rushed Inga, the grandmother and
Bubele to the local clinic. "I followed later in the morning and when I arrived, he
was declared dead." 'Their mother is devastated' Now grieving their loss, the family is still fearful for
Bubele's sibling, Bungcwele. The doctor at the local clinic in Khayelitsha requested to
see all three, and when one looked fragile, the doctor insisted on keeping her. "We're waiting for the doctor to give us feedback on
Bungcwele's condition. "Their mother is devastated," added Booi. Meanwhile, Bunono and Buchule are at home with their
grandmother after being discharged. The family will await results and a report back on
investigations to determine what happened to little Bubele.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/khayelitsha-quadruplets-mom-fearing-for-second-sick-child-20190801
