ORLANDO Pirates have continued with their player exodus as the club confirmed the departure of another player. Former Chippa United, Phetso Maphanga is the latest to leave the Buccaneers as he goes in search of game time elsewhere. The 25-year-old, who can play at left-back or on the wing, joined Pirates from Chippa at the start of 2018 but made only one appearance before being loaned back to the Chilli Boys for the second half of last season. "The player requested to be released from his contract and the Club has agreed to his request," Pirates tweeted. "The Club would like to wish Maphanga the best of luck in the future."
