TEN temporary classrooms as well as furniture and valuable books had burnt to the ground. This happened at Attwell Madala High School in Mthatha on Tuesday after pupils staged a class boycott and locked teachers out the school. Three of the burnt classrooms were supplied by the Education Department, while seven were built by parents out of their own pockets. SGB deputy chairman Ndoyisile Fudumele said the pupils were angry that education officials didn’t meet them on Monday. He said teaching and learning had been disrupted since 18 July after pupils blocked the N2, demanding a proper school. “I can’t say who burnt the school as no one has been arrested,” he said. Officials who were at the school estimated the damage to be millions. Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: “An interim investigation is under way. “We are going to work with the police so those found to be guilty will face the law,” he said. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said cops were investigating a case of arson. “Police went there when the pupils started protesting and removed them from the premises. Only pupils who use private transport were left behind. The police came back when the school was burning,” she said.
