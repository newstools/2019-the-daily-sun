RESEARCHERS were shocked to find that an elephant in the Kruger Park a few years ago had died of human TB. It was the first time an African elephant had died or been diagnosed with the disease. Prof Michele Miller of Stellenbosch University said Asian elephants previously were found to have the disease. They had a lot of contact with humans. She could not say how the African elephant caught the disease, but her team has tested 35 of the animals in the past three years. “We target adult bulls and hope to test 50 elephants, depending on the resources available,” said Miller. On Monday, the SunTeam was invited to watch an elephant being captured and tested. Vet Dr Peter Buss said they wanted to know if only one elephant had become ill with TB, or if it was a bigger problem. “We take their blood and clean their trunk to see if bacteria is present in their lungs,” said Buss. Veterinary technologist Tebogo Manamela said it was exciting to work in the wild and learn from experienced professionals. “I get to be hands on and hopefully help to save these African giants,” she said.
