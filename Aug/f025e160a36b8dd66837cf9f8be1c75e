WHAT’S yours is mine, what’s mine is yours! Now all customary marriages will have a joint ownership and that includes isithembu. Government has approved the Customary Marriages Amendment Bill, which will give women equal rights over marital property. That includes those who entered into customary marriages before the law came into effect in 2000. Presidency spokesman Jackson Mthembu said: “Spouses will have joint and equal proprietary rights over marital property.” Cultural law expert and lecturer at the University of Venda, Zama Mopai, said the days when wives couldn’t claim for anything after divorce were gone. She said most women married under customary marriages are still unaware of their rights. “It was unfair for the law to discriminate against women based on the date of marriage. “All other customary marriages have been amended and it is joint ownership unless there is an antenuptial contract. “Polygamous marriages were regulated according to tradition and women were unable to claim anything.” She said people needed to educate themselves about customary marriages and know they can’t divorce without going to court. On Facebook SunReader Neyola said: “I welcome it for the sake of rural women who went through a lot after the death of their husbands and they were bullied by in-laws.” Dikeledi said: “This will stop men from toying with women.” Themba said: “It’s hard to be a man in South Africa so I will stick to vat-en-sit.”
