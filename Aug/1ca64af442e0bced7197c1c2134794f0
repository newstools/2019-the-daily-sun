NYANGA cops have advised Uber and Bolt drivers to focus on other areas other than Nyanga. They warned them to be more vigilant as many drivers have been hijacked and robbed in the kasi. Police spokeswoman Captain Ntomboxolo Sitshitshi said: “We would like to urge drivers to be cautious when called to transport clients from or into the Nyanga policing precinct.” She said many cases had been reported at the station. “So far, the incidents occurred mostly at night in the Crossroads and Browns Farm area. “In some areas, women request to be picked up, but when the driver arrives to pick up the client, a different person comes to hijack and rob the driver. They sometimes drive away with him,” she said. Nwabisa Nkunzana from Crossroads told Daily Sun there were a lot of incidents where drivers were attacked. “This is bad as we want these services but we are going to suffer because of criminals,” she said Nwabisa. She said the two taxi companies were their only options as most Avanzas are driven by skollies. Sitshitshi advised other motorists to be vigilant as there have been hijackings in hotspots such as Govan Mbeki in Philippi, Bristol, Klipfontein and Eisleben. “Some arrests were made and the areas are being monitored.” Sitshitshi appealed to anyone with information on the suspects to call 021 380 3304/3374, 082 469 2470 or CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
