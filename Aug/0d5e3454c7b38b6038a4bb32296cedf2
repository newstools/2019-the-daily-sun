THEY have found a place to call home and are ready to deal with anyone who dares to mess with them. Shack dwellers from Phumula Mqashi informal settlement in Lenasia, south of Joburg, said they have found peace since moving into the area. Emmanuel Malinga (35) told Daily Sun he had been renting a room in Soweto for 15 years and moving to Phumula Mqashi was a good decision. “I moved here four months ago and have never been happier. I pay no rent and can save up money,” he said. Emmanuel said he did not pay to get land, but moved into a space someone had erected a shack, but didn’t live there. “When I got here, I spoke to community leaders and told them I needed space,” he said. Miriam Mphahlele said she moved to the area a year ago and bought a stand for R500. “I was lucky I came earlier because people are now paying R2 500. Renting is expensive. It’s better to have your own space than suck up to a mastand,” she said. A man who only wanted to be known as Isaac said the informal settlement gave him a job. “I sell mkhukhus for a living. The more people move in, the more my business grows,” he said. MEC for Human Settlements, Urban Planning Lebogang Maile and Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba met to discuss the situation in Lenasia and the region involving land invasions. Maile and Mashaba agreed the situation in Lenasia required urgent attention. “We are faced with the crisis of landlessness in Johannesburg created through unimaginative approach to housing delivery and land ownership, which has resulted in informal settlements spreading across the province,” said Mashaba.
