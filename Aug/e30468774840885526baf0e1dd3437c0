The Miss South Africa pageant is just around the corner, and so far we already know that Bonang will be hosting again, designers like Lebogang Kekana and Anél Botha will be showing off their work, and the likes of Sho Madjozi and Nasty C will be performing. And now the organisation has revealed who will lead up the red carpet on the night. In a press statement released on Wednesday, Miss SA announced that TV personality Enhle Mbali will be "tracking all the stars as they make their arrival at the Sun Arena in Time Square." Speaking about the opportunity, Enhle said she is excited to take to the carpet on the night. The star also touched on the diversity of the Miss SA 2019 top 16, praising the organisation for leading the pack. "It's a beautiful thing to watch acceptance from every sphere. Not one group should dominate opinions or the social standard of anything. I'm really proud that the pageant has opened itself up to what the world currently should be. Kudos for being pioneers," she said. Miss South Africa 2019 will take place on 9 August at the Sun Arena in Pretoria and will broadcast live on M-Net (DStv 101) and Mzansi Magic (DStv 161). The winner will walk away with R3 million in prizes and sponsorships deals.
