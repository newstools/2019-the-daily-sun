WORKERS have not been paid their July salaries. As a result, municipal workers in the Bojanala Platinum district in Rustenburg, North West, have gone on strike. They are demanding that the municipality sort resolve the problem. The provincial government withheld funds due to non-compliance with the Municipal Finance Management Act. The grant enables municipalities to provide basic services, among other things. Samwu provincial deputy secretary Vanguard Mokwena said  workers want their salaries as the labour was provided to the municipality.“There’s no money because the office of finance in the province has withheld payment because Bojanala failed to comply with the act,” his said.the municipality had told workers it was trying to get a loan to pay them. Municipal spokesman Archie Babeile said the municipality had been dealing with Treasury since April. He said it was discovered that there were discrepancies in the April budget which led to workers not being paid. “Equitable shares were to be released last week, but that could not happen because of non-compliance. We’ve sent everything to the provincial treasury but still cannot confirm when will workers be paid,” he said. Some municipalities complied but their projections were unrealistic. The municipalities after the first meeting with North West Finance MEC Motlalepula Rosho. included Bojanala Platinum district, Naledi, Madibeng, Kgetleng, Dr Ruth Mompati district, Tswaing, Mamusa, Ditsobotla and Maquassi Hills.
