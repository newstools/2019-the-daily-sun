PUBLIC Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille wants to speed up the maintenance of government buildings. She said people were forced to do their work in old, outdated and rundown government buildings, including courts. “We need to make these public spaces comfortable and to have conducive conditions,” she said. De Lille said she would talk to different departments to see where her department could improve spaces. “I’ve been receiving complaints from across the country about the state of our court buildings. In some cases, lifts and air conditioners don’t work,” she said. De Lille said there were reports in Pinetown that rats ate people’s lunch and snakes ate the rats, while there was a constant sewerage smell. “This matter has prompted court officials, including prosecutors and magistrates to threaten strike action,” she said. In the Northern Cape, there had been little to no maintenance on mobile units. She said the units were meant to serve people in remote areas. “In Mpumalanga, court buildings are deteriorating to such an extent that they are a danger to people working there. It’s not good enough to say there is no money to deal with the issues, we do have the money. We must learn to spend properly,”” “We will move all the money that hasn’t been spent to deal with repairs and refurbishments.” She said the department had budgeted R2,5 billion for repairs during the 2019/20 financial year. “For every R10 the department spends on maintenance and repairs, R1 goes to the maintenance of courts and Department of Justice buildings,” she said. The total budget for repairs for justice totalling R260 million, and R229 million had been allocated to repair 105 courts. De Lille said the justice department had also allocated an additional R531 million for repairs from its own budget.
