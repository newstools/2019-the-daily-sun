BANYANA Banyana aim to continue with their goal scoring spree when they face Malawi on Friday at Wolfson Stadium, in Port Elizabeth (3.30pm). Desiree Ellis’ girls produced one of their biggest win in history when they ruthlessly walloped Comoros Island 17-0 on Wednesday in their opening Group A of the Cosafa Cup championship. The win surpassed Zimbabwe’s biggest win in the annual tournament, who crushed Lesotho 15-0 in the 2002 edition. Banyana, who also beat Botswana 14-0 and Mozambique 13-0 in the same tournament 17 years ago, are now perched at the top of the group with three points. They are followed by Malawi, who beat Madagascar 2-0 on the same day. The 56-year-old Ellis said it was a good start, but they’ll need to take that incredible form to their next game against Malawi. Said Ellis: “We spoke about the first game being the most important. It is out of the way now. Malawi won and its not going to be easy. But if we can maintain the same level, we can get the results we want. But we must be consistency.” Banyana’s last win was at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Awcon) in Ghana, November last year, when they beat Mali 2-0 to qualify for their maiden World Cup. With the Comoros victory, Banyana ended their 13 games winless run. Ellis added: “I said we must use this tournament to prepare also for the Olympic qualifiers, but also to show what we learnt at the World Cup. We have to consistently raise the bar, especially in the next game and get three points and proceed to the next round.” Captain on the day Refiloe Jane, who scored four goals against the Islanders to walk away with Woman of the Match, admitted it could have been more. The 27-year-old said the players celebrated the emphatic win and they now they face Malawi full of confidence. She said: “The next match won’t be easy. We just have to be focused on what we can do to get a win and proceed to the next round.”
