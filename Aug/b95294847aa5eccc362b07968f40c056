Gauteng Premier David Makhura helped bring the law back to the streets on Thursday morning in Sandton, Johannesburg. Makhura was accompanied by MEC for Community Safety Faith Mazibuko. Together they helped Gauteng law enforcement impound five taxis for not having proper documentation and two drivers who were caught for not having licenses on the R55 road in Sandton. The operation started on Wednesday with Gauteng police targeting wanted suspects of gender-based violence and violence against kids. Major General Anna Mateisi from SAPS said that the operation was led by females.  "The two-day operation resulted in more than 400 people being arrested. 29 of the suspects arrested were suspects of gender-based crimes and violence against children. This includes suspects who were wanted for rape, sexual assault, assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm and common assault," Mateisi said. Makhura said that he is very happy with the operation taking place during August, a month that commemorates women.  "We want to make Gauteng Province safe, particularly for women and children. The intensification of our operation during this month will continue," Makhura said. Makhura said that if you know that you are a wanted criminal you better hand yourself over to the police. "We are coming for you," Makhura said.
