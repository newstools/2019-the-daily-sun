home in Fichardtpark on the evening of July 8. Police

appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Monday on a count of murder. On July 19,
Volksblad reported that Mokoena's wife, Kelebogile Louisa Mokoena, 51, a nurse,
allegedly poisoned her own dogs to make it easier for three hitmen to kill her
husband. She
reportedly abandoned her bail application in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's
Court on July 18. The case was postponed for further investigation. Mokoena was
arrested after she was linked to the murder of her husband, Free State police
said on July 10, IOL reported. Scuffle After the
dogs died, she allegedly left the gate and front door open. Mokoena's
husband was killed shortly after arriving at their house in Schnehage Crescent
on July 8 at 21:35, Bloemfontein Courant reported. He
reportedly found his wife in the main bedroom and went on to the bathroom where
he found the armed men. A scuffle
ensued and he was dragged back to the bedroom where he was shot in the head in
the presence of his wife. The
suspects left the scene with the deceased's vehicle, an undisclosed amount of
money and cellphones. The vehicle was later found abandoned in Lourier Park,
according to OFM. Volksblad
reported that the couple had been experiencing marital problems. Mokoena's
wife reportedly paid a deposit the night before the murder and was planning to
settle the rest of the amount at a later stage. Police
spokesperson Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the woman was arrested by Parkweg
police the day after the murder, IOL reported. Mokoena's
wife remains in custody. SOURCE: NEWS24
