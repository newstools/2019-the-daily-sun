PROSECUTOR Nceba Ntelwa has accused Pastor Timothy Omotoso’s attorney of attacking the state. Ntelwa was responding to defence attorney Peter Daubermann’s application to force the state to give the defence more information on the charges. Daubermann, representing Omotoso, Zukiswa Sitho and Lusanda Solani, told the court yesterday he was given insufficient information about the racketeering, human trafficking and rape charges. The three face 97 charges. “I submit that this court must compel the state to provide us with more information because the particulars we have are not sufficient. The accused are entitled to that information,” he said. I’m sure during the alleged offences the complainants had cellphones. “Why did the state not obtain cellphone records to confirm their movements or get the complainants to point out the places the alleged offences took place? Why can’t the state give us specific dates?” Daubermann said the law is clear that an accused had to be provided with a charge sheet containing times, dates and nature of the offence. Ntelwa said it was not the first time the defence had requested the information. “We’ve supplied it to them and they were happy,” he said. “This is clearly an attack on the state because the type of information requested by the defence doesn’t advance the interests of justice and we did the best to meet their demand.” The matter has been postponed to today.
