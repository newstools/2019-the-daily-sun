 Just three
days after a teacher in Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal, was reported missing, the police
arrested two suspects last Friday after his body was found. According
to the police, a missing person's case was opened on July 30 after Youth
Academy teacher Vusumuzi Mlaba, 60, was reported missing. "While
police were conducting an investigation, they discovered that Mlaba was last
seen on July 25 by his family," provincial police spokesperson Colonel
Thembeka Mbele said in a statement. "The
investigation led police to Ntumeni, where they found a slightly decomposed
body covered by tree branches. The missing person's inquiry was immediately
changed to a case of murder." The police
then tracked the two suspects to Matshana in Empangeni. The
suspects, aged 18 and 21, were found in possession of the dead man's
belongings, including a vehicle and cellphone. Both men
are expected to appear in the Eshowe Magistrate's Court soon. SOURCE:
