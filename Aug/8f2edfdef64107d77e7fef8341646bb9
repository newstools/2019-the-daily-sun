VILLAGERS have been living in fear since a mysterious fire started attacking houses. The homes of Sosilina Nyamankulu (59) and Nothemba Tyaliti (58) in Muku Village, Dutywa, caught fire towards the end of last month. “I was attending a ceremony in another village on the 27th when I was told smoke was coming from my four-roomed house,” said Nothemba. She said when she got to the scene, neighbours had managed to put out the fire. “But 10 minutes later, the fire broke out again and everything in the house was burned to ashes,” she said. The following day, a nearby one-roomed structure mysteriously burned down. Just a day later, Sosilina’s rondavel burned down and Nothemba’s parents’ house caught fire. “I’ve never fought with anyone but I saw my home burning to ashes. I fear the fire can come again,” said Nothemba. On Saturday, the SunTeam was at the scene when the thatched roof of a rondavel belonging to the Tyaliti family caught fire while everyone was out attending to a sick teenager. Members of the family said they tried going to churches for prayers and consulting traditional healers but nothing helped. Neighbour Zolile Makinana said: “This is the first time something like this has happened. Everyone is now living in fear.”
