WHEN gogo Nkhathatseng Mokoena found out she died on 10 January she almost died from shock! “I went to report that I was not receiving my Sassa money,” the 79-year-old gogo told Daily Sun. “They said their system was showing I had died.” The gogo from Makhalaneng Village in QwaQwa, Free State, said she went to renew her ID because she couldn’t withdraw her Sassa money at the end of January. But officials told her she was dead. “I then decided to visit Home Affairs. They confirmed what Sassa had said. They even printed out the death certificate that said I had died from natural causes,” she said. “The names and the ID number on the death certificate are mine. I was so shocked they had to give me water to calm me down.” Nkhathatseng said her family wasn’t taking it well. Gogo’s 10th child, Khehla Mokoena (40), said his mother was receiving her husband’s pension money. But it was frozen after “her death” was reported. “She is sick. We are worried about her policies that may not pay if she passes away. Daily Sun is our only hope. It has been more than seven months and the Home Affairs keep saying they are still investigating,” said Khehla. Provincial Home Affairs manager Bonakele Mayekiso said he was not aware of the matter. “I am surprised they could do a death certificate printout for her. I advise gogo to go back to the Home Affairs and demand they take her fingerprints. “They will then alert head office that she is not dead,” Mayekiso said.
