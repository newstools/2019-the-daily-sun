The TechRoad’s exterior is enhanced by distinctive bespoke badging and red strips on the doors. On the inside, the upholstery features a high-quality finish, with red detailing on the seats and striking red interior finishes. It has generous specification with niceties lie climate control and cruise control.

It is mated to a six-speed manual transmission or an automatic transmission, while the claimed average fuel usage is a decent 4,8 litres/100km.
