RESIDENTS of KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, were woken by screams for help in the early hours of Saturday. The mugging victim was found dead in a stream later in the day. A witness told Daily Sun: “I saw a group of men beating a man and demanding his cellphone. “He was with a woman. I don’t know what happened to her.” The witness said she wanted to get closer but her mum stopped her. She was worried about her safety. She heard the man’s screams fading away after she went back into the house. “I thought the thugs let their victim go. I was shocked when a passersby said there was a man lying dead in the stream,” said the witness. “When I went to check, I discovered it was the same person who’d been attacked.” Another resident said the victim had been at a tavern earlier. “They could have been robbing him of his cellphone, or he could’ve stolen it from them. The attackers were heard saying ‘bring the phone’, as if it was theirs.” The residents said the attackers could’ve beaten the victim to death before throwing him into the stream. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A case of murder was opened at KwaMashu Police Station for investigation.”
