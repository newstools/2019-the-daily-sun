  TEACHING
and learning were affected by service delivery protest in the rural towns of
Bulwer, Underberg, Ixopo and Donnybrook in KZN. The protest
has cut out these small towns from big cities like Pietermaritzburg and Durban
from Monday when angry residents blocked main roads linking towns with other
parts of the province. One of the residentâ€™s
leaders Wele Nkomo said their anger is directed at Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma municipality
mayor Ngeneleni Mncwabe, who has been ignoring their demands to fix gravel
roads in their area. Nkomo said
they have been raising the same issues, but no one is taking them seriously. "It
looks like the only language officials understand is when people start
protesting. We have been talking to councilors and municipal officials and have
promised us, but nothing has happened since we met them last year," said
Nkomo. He said
schools have been closed and kids were sitting at homes from Monday. He said
although they care about children's future there was nothing they can do. Deputy
mayor Philani Shange said they have sent officials to address the residents. He said
some of the roads they complain about fall under the department of Transport. Nkomo said
they chased away officials because they wanted to be addressed by the mayor
herself.
