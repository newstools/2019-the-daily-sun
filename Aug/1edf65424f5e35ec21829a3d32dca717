MPUMALANGA Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane has urged traditional leaders to stop the infighting among royal families. Speaking at the opening of the House of Traditional Leaders on Wednesday, Mtshweni-Tsipane said divided communities created instability. “It undermines the integrity of the institution of traditional leadership and we are very concerned. Efforts to prevent this have not yielded the desired outcomes,” she said. “These people allocate land illegally, issue certificates for ingoma, which poses a threat to the lives of our children and render the authority of amakhosi ineffective through controversial cases,” she said. Mtshweni-Tsipane said government had a duty to educate residents that bukhosi wasn’t created through voting but was hereditary. “It is the sole right of the inner royal family, consisting of aunts, uncles and gogos, to appoint the rightful heir based on knowledge of the family’s history and the family tree,” she said. “The time has come for us to take bold steps to deal strongly with this challenge, otherwise history will judge us harshly that we allowed these disputes to destroy the sacred integrity of bukhosi,” she said. Mtshweni-Tsipane said government was duty-bound to protect the old-age tradition that forms part of people’s heritage from destruction, for the sake of the next generation.
