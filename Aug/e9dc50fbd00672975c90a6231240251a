IT is still amazing that Mamelodi Sundowns, a team under construction, could win the Absa Premiership and reach the Caf Champions League semifinals. According to coach Pitso Mosimane, the Brazilians achieved this feat competing with among others, a ”well-rested” Orlando Pirates. Mosimane has brought this fact up ahead of the start of the new 2019-20 season, explaining that Sundowns have a different programme as compared to their closest rivals. Downs begin the defence of their league title with a derby clash against Pretoria rivals, SuperSport United, at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday (3pm). ”If you are not running the same programme you are not competing!” Mosimane exclaimed.”You cannot say someone who is running a half-marathon and someone who is running the Comrades Marathon are competing. You must add a few kilometres, then we can talk when we were get to the end point. ”Pirates were well-rested in the last five games last season and you can see how they hammered people. Where was I? I went from Rabat to Thohoyandou in three days.” Like last season, Pirates and Sundowns are expected to battle it out for league honours. Added Mosimane: ”It is not easy in the beginning. We start slowly and that is why we don't do well in the top-eight. But in there weeks’ time Sundowns will be coming up. Mark my words.”
