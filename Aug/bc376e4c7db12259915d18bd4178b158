HOW did uThukela deputy mayor Nombali Mchunu lose a municipal vehicle? That is what KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka wanted to know yesterday. Hlomuka has ordered the municipality to investigate. Mchunu apparently used her official vehicle, a Toyota Fortuner, last Saturday to go and watch the Chiefs and Pirates game in Joburg. She apparently asked bodyguards to give her privacy, took the car, but later said she’d lost it. The MEC yesterday said Mchunu seemingly used the car without permission. “We asked the speaker to investigate. There are too many questions that can only be answered after an investigation.” IFP councillor Mthembeni Majola said the MEC had to appoint an independent team. Majola said Mchunu must pay back the money. National People’s Assembly councillor Nkosinathi Mthethwa said driving a council vehicle without permission on a personal trip was enough grounds for dismissal. Mchunu wouldn’t comment and referrred Daily Sun to the municipality. “The matter is being investigated by the municipality and co-operative affairs,” she said. Municipal manager Sifiso Kunene said the municipality would issue a formal statement.
