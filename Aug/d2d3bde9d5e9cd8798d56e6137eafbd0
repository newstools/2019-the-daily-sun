KAMOHELO has found a way to take care of himself and create employment in his community. And what started as a part-time job over weekends has grown into a sustainable business. Kamohelo Mphirime runs a shoe washing business. “When I started the business, I was working from hand to mouth. “I did not think it would turn out to be this big. I saw a gap in the market, where people were lazy to wash their takkies. “I decided to take advantage of this and offered to wash people’s takkies on weekends,” he said. He said the business so far employs two people from the community on a part-time basis. “The employees are gaining some work experience and are able to provide for their families. “I’m not working. I depend on this business. When I started out my family thought I was crazy, but they are now happy I can provide for them,” said Kamohelo. The business is run next to the busy Moshoeshoe Road in Mangaung. It attracts clients from different parts of Bloemfontein. On average, the business takes in about 40 pairs of different kinds of shoes per week. The cost of the service depends on the material of the shoes. “I have big plans for my business. We plan on turning it into a franchise.” He said he markets his business through social media. “I want to own a takkie laundry and hire more people,” he said.
