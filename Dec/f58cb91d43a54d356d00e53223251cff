BAROKA FC coach Wedson Nyirenda is determined to cause an upset by claiming their first three points at home in expense of Orlando Pirates. Since the 2019-20 Absa Premiership campaign started, Bakgaga have recorded just three victories and none of them have come in front at their own turf. They are currently in 12th position with 13 points after 13 matches. Their coach Nyirenda remains hopeful that his charges have the ability to get one over Pirates, just like they did in the Telkom Knockout final last season to lift their first ever major trophy. The two sides will meet in a blockbuster at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). "This game is very important to us because we haven't won at home this season," Nyirenda said. "Our home record is very pathetic, and we need to change that. We need to be dominant at home. We've lost and drawn games at home which is not right. We need to do better starting with the game against Pirates," "Pirates haven't started well. They've also struggled for results and they know that they need to push in order to be back where they belong. So, I am expecting a very entertaining game, both teams will fight. "Tactically, we have to be disciplined. We are aware that they will throw everything at us. They are a well-organised team. Very structured. They have the players that can dictate the pace of the game. "Pirates are playing good football but we will give it our best shot." -Sport24
