FORMER Sars commissioner Tom Moyane will have to wait until next year to be tried for the alleged assault of the mum of his grandchild. He appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court yesterday. The case was postponed to May. Dressed in a beige jacket, shirt and a pair of black trousers, Moyane smiled and greeted the prosecution team and his legal representative before entering the dock. At his last court appearance, the matter was postponed to allow lobby group AfriForum, which is privately prosecuting him, to hand over the docket to his legal team. Yesterday, AfriForum’s Advocate Phyllis Vorster told the court copies of the docket had been handed to the defence team. The trial was set for 5 and 6 May. Moyane was warned a warrant would be issued for his arrest should he fail to appear. He appeared to be in a hurry when he left the courtroom after the postponement. He faces charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm as well as damage to property. In May last year, he allegedly assaulted Lerato Maila, who was 17 at the time. Moyane allegedly tackled and kicked her during an altercation. Medical reports show she sustained a bruised jaw, a cut inside her cheek and a bruise in the abdomen. The NPA had declined to prosecute, saying the prospects of success were slim. But AfriForum, led by prosecutions unit head Advocate Gerrie Nel, took over the matter. – NEWS24
