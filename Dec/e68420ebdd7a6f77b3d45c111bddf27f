BAFANA Bafana star Percy Tau was back amongst the goals for his Belgian outfit Club Brugge at the weekend. Tau bagged a goal and an assist as he helped Brugge maintain the lead at the top of the Belgian Pro League with a 3-0 win over Mechelen. The 25-year-old, who played 70 minutes, opened the scoring for Brugge in the 28th minute before playing in Nigerian Emmanuel Bonaventure for the second goal to cap off a fine display on the day. The former Mamelodi Sundowns star had been rather quiet in front of goal with his last goal coming back in September against Francis Borains in the Belgian Cup. He will now be looking to continue his fine form in the cup when they face Anderlecht in the quarter finals of the Belgian Cup on Thursday.
