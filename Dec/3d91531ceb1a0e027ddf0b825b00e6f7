South African life insurers noticed over 3 708 fraudulent
and dishonest claims to the value of R1.06 billion in 2018. According to the Savings and Investment South Africa
(ASISA), the total number of irregular claims was lower in 2018 than in 2017. Life insurers reportedly detected 5 026 fraudulent and
dishonest claims worth R1.13 billion. Convener of the ASISA Claims Standing Committee Donovan
Herman, says life insurers owe it to honest policyholders to protect the
integrity of the long-term insurance model by preventing fraud and dishonesty. “If we allow fraudulent and dishonest claims, honest
policyholders will ultimately end up footing the bill through higher premiums
driven by untenable claims rates.” He says while life insurers are frequently accused by the
public of trying to avoid paying claims, the numbers tell a different story. In 2018, life insurers paid 99.3% of claims made against
fully underwritten individual life policies alone, to a value of R15.1 billion. “Misrepresentation occurs when a policyholder deliberately
provides misleading information to a life insurer, while material
non-disclosure refers to the failure of policyholders to disclose important
information about a medical condition or lifestyle,” Herman said. According to Herman, most of the fraudulent activity in 2018
took place in the funeral insurance space. Reports from the forensic departments of life insurers show
that the buying and renting of dead bodies for the purpose of obtaining
fraudulent death certificates is a popular modus operandi.
