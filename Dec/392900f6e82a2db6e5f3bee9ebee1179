Shimza shared his Christmas Day with orphans from around Gauteng. The popular DJ, whose real name is Ashley Raphala, hosted a Christmas party for kids who live in orphanages before his annual Shimza's One Man Show (OMS). He said the idea to celebrate Christmas with the kids came to him after he realised it would be nice if kids in orphanages also had a great Christmas Day. "Christmas is a holiday that people spend with their families and there are children out there who don't have families. There are a lot of orphanages in Tembisa and I figured it would be a great idea to make Christmas fun for those children. So while people are having fun and eating with their families, it only made sense for these children to have fun and eat too," he said. Shimza said he's been doing this for 10 years and it's been growing bigger by the years. He said: "When we started this 10 years ago, we did it only for kids in Tembisa. However, as OMS grew bigger, I wanted this to be bigger as well. Now we get kids from all over Gauteng.Â My family cooks for the kids. We also bring jumping castles, party packs and entertainment, among other things." According to the DJ, they also buy school shoes for the kids. "We take money from the tickets sales of the main event, OMS, and buy shoes for the kids in January," said Shimza. One Man Show took place on Christmas Day and artists such as Kwesta, AKA, Sjava, Cassper Nyovest, K.O, Nadia Nakai, Busiswa and more, performed. My community is my family ?? Merry Christmas ????
