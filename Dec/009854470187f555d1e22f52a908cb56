CHIPPA United are set to continue wielding the axe. According to SunSport insiders at the club, Chippa are negotiating the release of Kurt Lentjies, Andile Mbenyane and former Bloemfontein Celtic goalkeeper, Patrick Tignyemb. It has emerged that coach Norman Mapeza is not happy with the contribution of these players, and the former Ajax Cape Town midfielder wants players who can contribute more to the Port Elizabeth-based club this season. “Chippa are negotiating the packages of Andile Mbenyane, Kurt Lentjies, Patrick Tignyemb,” said the informer. “Coach Mapeza has not been won over by these players and he feels they should move on. Remember Mapeza made it clear that for the club to survive, they need to sign new players in the upcoming January transfer window.” Chippa have already started chopping their deadwood – yesterday, they mutually terminated the contracts of Rhulani Manzini and Lerato Manzini. This came after both players scored only one league goal between them. Club’s COO Lukhanyo Mzinzi said there’s a possibility of other players departing with the Manzinis. “We have amicably parted ways with Lerato and Rhulani,” said Mzinzi. “You might have seen that some of the players have not been playing, either because of injuries or due to loss of form. The coach came in mid-season and there’s bound to be changes there and there. I’m not saying there won’t be any other changes in the club, that I cannot vouch. But so far we have released these two players.” In Tignyemb’s case, the Cameroon goalie’s future looks very dim. He’s reported to be one of the highest paid players in the club. Ironically, in the last four matches Chippa have won three matches and drew the other, with Tignyemb overlooked and Veli Mothwa preferred in goals.
