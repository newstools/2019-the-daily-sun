FORMER miners thought they were finally going to get their money. But their hopes were dashed when they discovered they were only there to hand over a memorandum. Hundreds of ex-miners and their families waited for hours outside the offices of the Medical Bureau of Occupational Diseases. The marchers, who belong to the South African Destitute Ex-Miners Forum, walked from the bureau in Braamfontein, Joburg, to the Chamber of Mines offices in the inner city. An angry madala (76) told Daily Sun: “We submitted all the documents they wanted, so we don’t understand why we are actually here.” Another madala said he wouldn’t have come if he’d known he was called to only sign his name and go. “I spent R110 for a single trip to come here. I could’ve done something with that money. I thought we were going to get our money today,” he said. Forum spokesman Mangaliso Sambo said: “The confusion was caused by a lack of communication from the leaders. “Some may not have understood because there was no communication with the crowd while the leaders were inside. “The actual purpose of being here was to hand over a memorandum to the bureau chief. We ended up having a long meeting inside. The problem with this place is that it’s understaffed, so ex-miners have to wait an average 12 years before they’re compensated. Those are some of the things we’re trying to iron out.” Most of the ex-miners suffered from lung diseases such as Silicosis and TB. According to Sambo, the forum had about five million ex-miners on its database, but only had the capacity to pay 2% each financial year. The arrival of Prophet Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng later in the day lifted the mood a bit. Mboro said mine owners lived luxurious lives, while miners lived with life-threatening illnesses. He warned the former miners not to allow divisive people make the lose focus.
