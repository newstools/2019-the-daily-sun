COPS bust three people for possession of dangerous weapons after a fight broke out among refugees temporarily accommodated in the Methodist Church in Cape Town. The fight was allegedly started on Sunday night by refugees who were gatvol with leader JP Balus and agitated for his suspension from all leadership roles. PABALLO'S LOVER: MY WIFE DID NOT KILL HER! Balus reportedly retaliated by preventing a church service from continuing, leading to a scuffle. The refugees have been living at the church for the past three months. This was after they were evicted from UNCHR’s offices, where they had gone to call on the body to repatriate them to other countries. They said they no longer felt safe in South Africa following a wave of xenophobic attacks in the country. Some of the refugees claimed Balus’ supporters threatened them with axes. They told Daily Sun they didn’t want to fight but were tired of the abuse by Balus’ faction. “To threaten people is not leadership. We want someone who cares for everyone, not just for a group of people,” said Hannas Marjeh, a refugee from Cameroon. RAGE OVER KFC WEDDING! Daily Sun couldn’t reach Balus as his cellphone was on voicemail. Police spokesman Andre Traut said cops responded to the fighting between the two groups. “During our intervention, three men were arrested for being in possession of dangerous weapons. “They will appear in court once they’ve been charged. The situation has since been stabilised. “Our members are still patrolling the area to ensure that law and order is maintained,” said Traut. Recently the City of Cape Town applied to court to have refugees interdicted from threatening tourists and other people in the area. Balus previously refuted the claims.
