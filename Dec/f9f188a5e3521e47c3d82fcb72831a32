LEENETJE Mosoane had a good relationship with her cousin. They helped each other out financially. But all this came to an end after Leenetje borrowed R20 000 from a mashonisa on behalf of her cousin. Leenetje (55) of Rosslyn Gardens, north of Tshwane, claimed her cousin had since disappeared and did not want to pay back the money. “He was very stressed and said his office furniture was going to be repossessed and needed money urgently to settle his debt,” she said. She took him to a mashonisa in Tembisa in July. FIRE RUINS THEIR FESTIVE CHEER! “He said he’d pay back the money at the end of August but didn’t. “I phoned but he didn’t take my calls. I tried using other people’s phones, but he’d switch his phone off once he heard my voice.” Leenetje said she went to her cousin’s house, but the security guard at the complex refused to open for her. “They called him and he told the guard not to open for me. I’ve tried everything. “I’ve even involved other relatives, but he still doesn’t want to pay back the money.” PICS: BOYFRIEND VS BEN 10! She said the money had accumulated interest and the mashonisa wanted it from her. “She said I should pay it because I’m the one who brought him to her.” Leenetje said she now feared for her life. Her cousin, who only gave his name as Tami, told Daily Sun he deposited the money into Leenetje’s account. “I deposited R30 000 into her bank account.  She even acknowledged receiving the money. “I suspect she used it thinking she’d replace it.”
