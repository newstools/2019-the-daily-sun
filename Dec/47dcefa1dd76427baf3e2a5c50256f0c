THOMAS Chauke was left fuming after he was mistreated at the Mapungubwe Arts Festival in Polokwane on Saturday night. The Tsonga traditional musician claimed he was taken off stage during his performance on the instruction of Limpopo MEC for Sport, Arts and Culture Thandi Moraka. Music fans were left shocked and Chauke said he felt humiliated and belittled. Speaking to the SunTeam, Chauke said it seemed there were people who want to destroy his legacy. “I stopped playing and the MEC didn’t come on stage. The programme director started introducing other artists. I was booked for a 45-minutes set and this came as a shock,” he said. Spokesman Lucky Tshilimandila blamed the event organisers. He said the MEC apologised to Chauke and claimed she was not involved in stopping him from performing. “The MEC only went on stage when she was called by the MC to present the premier and Bishop Lekganyane. She was only made aware later that he was stopped from performing. “After learning of the interruption, she immediately went to offer an apology,” he said. Stella Baloyi from Daily Double Event Management Company, which organised the festival, refused to comment. She referred all inquiries to the department.
