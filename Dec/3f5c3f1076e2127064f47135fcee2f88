We all know Thembi Seete as a dancer, singer, actor and an all-around entertainer. But the Boom Shaka member, who just added motherhood in her busy schedule, is an also a smart businesswoman. I guess you didn’t know that! Apart from shaking her goodie and gyrating in her sexy skimpy outfits, Thembi also shakes good business deals. If her Instagram is anything to go by, Thembi is doing well for herself, from jetting around the world and shopping at high-end fashion stores such as Gucci and LV. The former beauty queen is also a smart businesswoman who co-owns a cleaning company called Cleanup Enterprise, a beauty spa salon called Azuri beauty Bar and Dulge Lounge, which also has a marquee during the Gauteng Summer Cup. We say Kudos to Thembi for not putting her eggs in one box.
