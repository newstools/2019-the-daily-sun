ALLOW me to brag! Yours in gossip has landed the ultimate VVIP invite to watch and follow American superstar rapper, Rick Ross, around. I can exclusively reveal, darlings, that he’ll perform at the Mahikeng Rugby Stadium on Christmas Eve. He’s also set to spend Xmas there too. So, slay queens, fix your weaves and fake bums! The tender is out. As we all know, ke Dezemba and it’s my duty as Social Minister to attend to pressing social issues. So, last Saturday I braved the heatwave to attend the Gauteng Cup and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made since divorcing my fourth husband. It was a fun day to be out, although you needed binoculars to spot a celebrity. But the Vonguish Marquee more than made up for this, thanks to publicist, Simphiwe Majola. Booze came in bottles, people were dressed to the nines and the music was on point. After redeeming myself, I attended the GQ Man of the Year Awards. The glamourous doo was held in Houghton, Jozi. Of course, GQ means high fashion and people didn’t disappoint, except for amapiano group, Semi Tee. They looked like they were going to chill at the infamous Kwa-Joe’s tarven. Even the host wanted to get them kicked out and they were there to sing their hit, Ama Uber. Hand-in-hand, they walked together. Should we get our outfits ready? Now, I’m not sure if it was a sense of deja vu, but Katlee wore a similar tux to the one he had on at the E! event at Saints about a month ago. She’s definitely a yummy mummy!
