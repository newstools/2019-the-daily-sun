NOT even heavy rain could stop a march and prayer session on Saturday. Apostle Dipuo Sebidi of the Holy Jerusalem Worship Centre in Mahube Valley, Tshwane, led the march in Mamelodi against the abuse of women and children, drug abuse, violence and human trafficking. She said the march, which ended with a prayer session at the Memolodi West Central Ground, was an annual event started seven years ago. “I believe the rain is a sign of God’s blessing. It doesn’t bother us. People call me a rain queen,” said Dipuo. “This year’s event was big. In the past we hosted it in halls, but because of the large turnout this year we decided to host it at the central ground.” Chief Sizani Mahlangu from Mamelodi East said he was happy to take part in the initiative. “This is a good initiative and it’s important to be part of the march and prayer,” he said. Pastor June Tladi from Limpopo, who was invited to take part, said she enjoyed interacting with the community. “We’re praying for crime and the abuse of women and children to end,” she said. The marchers handed over a memorandum to Colonel Mlungisi Dlamini, who received it on behalf of Mamelodi West Police Station commander Brigadier Lungiswa Tshayana.
