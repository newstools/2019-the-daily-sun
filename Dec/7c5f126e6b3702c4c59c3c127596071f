Shabalala said a colleague once shared how she couldn’t spend Christmas with her family because she was ill as a child. “Her being burnt during the festive season wasn’t a big deal. But the fact that she was in hospital and having to spend Christmas there was something she’ll never forget,” she said. Thandi Shabangu (28), mum of three-year-old Mpendulo Mavuso, said it had been a tough two weeks for the family since her son was admitted to hospital. “We’re used to be home with everyone enjoying during this time. If he was home, he was going to be running around and playing with his cousins,” she said.
