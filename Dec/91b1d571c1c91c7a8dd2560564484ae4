Shivam Kumar(6) was born with a 'tail' and he is being worshipped as a monkey god. Neighbours believe the boy is a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god Hanuman but his parents have been forced to hide him away due to the attention. People believe that he is a divine being due to the unusual growth of hairs on his back, so they shower him with chocolates and snacks but the family's local guru asked them to stop letting people carry on with worshipping him as a God as this would it would have untold effects on his psyche in later life.  The growth shocked doctors and Shivam's parents and they refuse to shave it off because Shivam's says "it would bring a bad omen for our family". "Sometimes people would come and ask about Shivam but we would deny them by saying he is not in the house."When asked if the doctors have suggested any treatment for Shivam, Reena is adamant "there is nothing wrong with my son as he is perfectly healthy". Mirror reports. "This might have been a gift of God and we do not want to tamper with any of his plans." Shivam's grandmother.
