STARTING any kind of business comes with a lot of challenges. Edward Kgarose (30), an Agri-entrepreneur from Makatjane Village Ga Molepo in Limpopo, produces sweet potato yoghurt. He said he’s had to learn a lot of lessons since starting his business. According to Edward, one of the biggest challenges that his company and many other small businesses face was a lack of support from government. Edward’s innovative invention dates back to 2015 and has opened many doors for him.  “Government claims to be helping small businesses, but some of the requirements are impossible to meet,” he said. “My business has the potential to create many job opportunities. But it’s become difficult for us to make that a reality.” Edward’s dream is to get a bigger processing factory to help small farmers grow. He said: “When a farmer has a contract to produce a specific amount of sweet potatoes, they’ll employ more people. The more sweet potatoes they produce, the more we process and the more jobs we create.” At the moment, Edward is renting a small factory in Polokwane to create his popular range of yoghurts. “There’s a lot that still needs to be done to reach the level that I want. I get calls from many people from all nine provinces in Mzansi. “Proper distribution is a major problem at the moment. We need to ensure the product is distributed according to the Health and Safety Act,” he said. Edward might be faced with lots of challenges, he is adamant his star will soon shine brighter. His product is available at several supermarkets in Polokwane at R10.99. He said he was also getting transport support from VW commercial in Polokwane. This year, Edward won the Youth in Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries award in the Small Scale Agro Processing Recognition category. Last year, he also won R50 000 on SABC1’s business show, Making Moves.
