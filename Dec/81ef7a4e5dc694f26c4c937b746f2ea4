IT takes a lot to impress Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane. When Mosimane lavish praise on a player, little doubt is left that the player is worthy of a place in the star-studded Downs line-up. The latest to earn rave reviews from the former Bafana Bafana coach is Sphelele Mkhulise, the ever-improving young attacker. “He reminds me of how Percy came up. And you know I’m a conservative coach‚ also‚” Mosimane said of Mkhulise. “I probably would have kept Percy a little bit longer (Before his move overseas). “Even with Bongani Zungu and Keagan Dolly I said‚ ‘One more year’ Why? Because I’m a conservative. I just want more surety. “A good player, he can lose the ball a bit sometimes. He’s happy. You can see he’s young‚ fearless and enjoys himself. So you’ve got to let that go. And also if you’re going to tell him he’s losing the ball a lot‚ then you’re putting him in a cage again.“ I want to release him to do what he wants‚ and then I can show him the mistakes later. He links well with Gaston. So does Themba. It will be good to have all those three on the pitch‚ because it’s creativity‚ more than effort." Mosimane has admitted he may have delayed a little bit bringing Mkhulise, who had a blinder against Pedro De Luanda in their Caf Champions League match, up to the senior team. But he explained: “You’ve also got to understand that last year he was competing with Lebo Maboe‚ who was top scorer‚ and Gaston. ‘Mshishi’ (Themba Zwane) were there. There was not an easy space. Anthony Laffor was part of the programme.”
