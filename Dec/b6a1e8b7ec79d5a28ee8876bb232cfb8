  EFF is planning to take the party’s concept across the
continent after the emergence of other parties in the Southern African
Development Community inspired by the red berets. The party’s commission on international affairs discussed
the possibility of establishing regional offices in the SADC, Western and
northern Africa. Chairman of the commission Thembi Msane told journalists
that the idea was to have presidents of the EFF across the country but have one
commander in chief who would obviously be Julius Malema as the party was born
here. Msane said the commission also suggested the establishment
of a youth structure for the continent. Malema also revealed this at a press conference where he
said the party’s vision was to lead the continent, in reminiscent of a call
once hatched by Libyan leader Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi. “Our vision is not these small-minded things that you are
thinking about. We want to lead Africa. We want a United States of Africa with
one currency, with one economy, with one judiciary,” Malema said. But Msane was hard
pressed to explain how this was going to be achieved in other countries where
the sovereignty has to be observed. She did point out though that in Namibia for instance the
EFF secured two seats in parliament, saying this could be done in other
countries as well.
