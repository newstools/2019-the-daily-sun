A 22-year-old woman was at the party with her boyfriend at
Burlington Informal Settlement in Malvern. While at the party a fight between the two broke out and the
boyfriend took out a knife and stabbed the victim on the neck. Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said she was
transported to hospital where she was confirmed as dead on arrival. “The suspect fled the scene after the incident. A case of
murder was opened for investigation at Malvern SAPS. “An intensive investigation was conducted by a team of
detectives and a 25-year-old suspect was traced and arrested at his hideout,” Brigadier
Naicker said. The knife used in the commission of the crime was seized by
the police. He is due to appear in the Pinetown Magistrates’ Court this
week. The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant
General Khombinkosi Jula praised the police officers from Malvern for the
speedy arrest. “It is so heart-breaking to learn that while we are
observing the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence, there are
people who continue to terrorise and kill our women,” Jula said.
