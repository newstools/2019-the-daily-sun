KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala and Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu donated blood on Saturday. The two visited the National Blood Service depot at Umlazi’s Megacity Shopping Centre, south of Durban, to encourage residents to boost the province’s blood bank. Anyone in good health aged between 16 and 65 may donate. The blood is used during childbirth, on cancer patients, people involved in accidents and patients who suffer complications during surgery. Zikalala said: “As we enter the festive season, we experience more accidents. As a result, institutions that keep blood often run short of supplies. “A blood donation from one person could save three lives. To donate blood is to save the life of another person.” He urged motorists to drive safely and stick to rules of the road.  Health MEC Simelane-Zulu urged residents to get tested for HIV, take their medication if they test positive, and use condoms. “We’re calling on people to ensure they celebrate responsibly,” she said. Umlazi resident Sandile Xulu (35) said it was good to see the premier donating blood. “I’ll also do the same because I want to help save lives.”
