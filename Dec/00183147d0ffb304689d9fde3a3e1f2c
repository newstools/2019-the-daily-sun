ONE of Kaizer Chiefs’ old guards is wanted abroad. Midfielder George Maluleka has attracted interest from a few clubs in Europe. According to SunSport sources, Maluleka, who has been at Chiefs since joining the club in the second half of the 2013/14 season from SuperSport, has been followed by scouts from overseas. The scouts were also in attendance when Chiefs hammered Stellenbosch FC 4-0 at the Cape Town Stadium midweek, although Maluleka remained on the bench. SunSport sources said one club in particular, that is keeping an eye on Maluleka, is Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers, who are managed by Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard. What will make Maluleka’s move abroad a success is that the former Ajax Cape Town midfielder is in the last year of his contract with Amakhosi. This means the 30-year-old is free to speak to any club of his choice without Chiefs’ consent in January. Then, he’ll be left with a six-month contract, leaving him with no danger in leaving at the end of the season. Maluleka’s agent Shaun Roberts described the former Under-20 international’s future as “delicate” and said everything would be clearer in the new year. “It’s a delicate situation at the moment. Call me in the new year and we can have a proper conversation,” said Roberts. “At the moment, George is happy at Kaizer Chiefs and obviously playing well and is a regular. “I think we can sort of have a conversation properly in the new year.” It’s not only Maluleka whose future at Chiefs is up in the air. Also, Bernard Parker is in the last year of his contract and neither parties, including that of Parker’s from Prosport International, have engaged to extend it or not. SunSport revealed last year that Parker was on a rolling contract. It’s assessed each season, based on his contribution and how many games he has played. He signed a one-year extension in March last season.
