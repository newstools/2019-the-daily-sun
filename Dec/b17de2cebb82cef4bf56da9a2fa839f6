IT SEEMS there’s a war over routes between the Orange Farm and Lawley taxi associations. Yesterday morning, members of one association apparently hunted down the other. A group of men in a taxi opened fire at association members in a car. “It was like a movie. They drove past and opened fire at them. These guys were lucky no one died,” said a witness.

It apparently started on the Golden Highway and continued in residential areas. Gloria Sibanyoni (35) told Daily Sun a bullet missed her by inches.  “I thank God and my ancestors for saving my life and family,” she said. Gloria was busy doing laundry and heard a sound when she moved to switch on a kettle. “The bullet hit one side of my shack and went through to the other side. It was followed by gunshots. I tried to go outside to look for my son but my boyfriend, hiding at the neighbour’s, screamed at me to go back inside. I went inside and lay flat on the floor, praying for the safety of my son,” she said. READ: WATCH: SPINNING SUV GOES HORRIBLY WRONG! Luckily, her son returned unharmed.
