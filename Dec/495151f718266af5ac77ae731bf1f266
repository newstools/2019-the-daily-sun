IT WAS supposed to be a stop next to the road for the three friends to pee. But it then turned into a bloodbath. PABALLO'S LOVER: MY WIFE DID NOT KILL HER! As the three men stood beside the road in Botshabelo section A, Free State, a car pulled up and bullets started raining on them. Lehlohonolo Masilo (53) was shot in the head and Anthony Radebe (55) in the ribs. They both died instantly. The third man, whose identity is unknown at this stage, fled the scene. But then he realised he was bleeding in the mouth and flagged down a passing car to take him to hospital, where he alerted staff members and cops. FIVE STABBED AT RELIGIOUS EVENT! Lehlohonolo’s widow, Masechaba, said: “On Saturday he told me he was going to his farm with friends. I learnt about his death after police came to my house. “He was a taxi owner, so I believe his killing might have something to do with that. I want justice for my husband.” Anthony’s widow, Josiphia, said: “I became worried when he didn’t come back home from the farm. There was no reason to take his life. “He was a peaceful man who was loved by everybody.” A bystander said the men were on the side of the road playing loud music from the car when bullets started flying. “I believe they were attacked by people they had argued with earlier,” she said. G-STRING CURSE, THEN DEATH! Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said two cases of murder and one of attempted murder had been opened. He said the three men were drinking at a house when they decided to move to another venue in a bakkie. He said it appeared that while the men were peeing, a vehicle approached and the occupants started shooting at them. No one has been arrested.
