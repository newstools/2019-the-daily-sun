The people of Mamelodi East, Tshwane near Pienaarspoort Station, told Daily Sun they had to stay outside to monitor their kids’ safety. Resident Donald Makhelane (35) said a small hole appeared last Sunday. “We’re scared because it’s getting big every day.” Donald said they lived in fear because the hole was just in front of their houses. “We’re scared that if the hole grows, our shacks will collapse,” he said. Residents appealed to the City of Tshwane to help them resolve the problem before something bad happened. READ: BABES WODUMO: PLEASE PRAY FOR ME!
