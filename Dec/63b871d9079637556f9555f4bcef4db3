CAPE Town Metro cops are concerned about the high number of fake firearms confiscated recently. Police confiscated 28 fake guns from July to this month, and 72 suspects were bust. According to Metro police chief Wayne Le Roux, many of these incidents happened in Manenberg, Mitchells Plain, Delft, Heideveld and Hanover Park. “The increase in imitation firearms is not surprising. “They’re easier to get hold of, can fool most people into believing it is the real thing and it’s likely that criminals believe they will face a lesser charge if they’re caught,” Le Roux said. However, he said the thugs were mistaken as they would still face the full might of the law. “This is an unfortunate misperception as suspects are charged in terms of the legislation, even if an imitation firearm was used in the commission of a crime.” Safety and Security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith said the arrests were due to proactiveness of the cops through various operations, which included search and seizure. He said Metro cops would intensify their operations to ensure people enjoyed the festive season in peace. “We also encourage the public to continue passing on tips and information that can help bring criminals to book, as their assistance has proven to be invaluable,” said Smith.
