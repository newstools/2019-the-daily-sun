It’s important to be responsible and alert at all times, especially during the festive season. As we celebrate this happy season, let’s always put safety first to avoid disasters. The country is at last getting some much-needed rainfall, which is not only improving water levels in our dams but also tempting us to cool off in our private and public swimming pools in this excessively hot weather. It’s, therefore, important to ensure the water we swim in is clean to avoid contracting waterborne diseases. Drowning is major cause of death during this time of the year. Make sure you supervise your kids as they go to the public swimming pools or are in the company of an adult with the necessary swimming skills. Also, let’s not drink and jump into the water as alcohol and water don’t mix. Letter from Themba Khoza in Mbombela
