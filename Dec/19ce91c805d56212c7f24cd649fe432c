SAKHEPHI Mkhize has accused his councillor of firing him because of political differences. The 56-year-old from Masameni Village in Donnybrook, southern KZN, was employed as a water monitor in the Harry Gwala Municipality in 2006 and worked with different councillors over the years.

He said since then, he had been in and out of municipal offices fighting for his pay. Mkhize said he and Dlamini were in different ANC camps before the elective conference in December 2017. Mkhize said he heard rumours that Dlamini told people if he became councillor, he would fire him. Mkhize said he was close to former Councillor Winnet Mtolo, who didn’t see eye to eye with Dlamini. Mtolo was in Cyril Ramaphosa’s camp, while Dlamini wanted Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be ANC president. He said his family had been surviving on his wife’s disability grant. Water services head Councillor Bheki Nzimande said it was the first time he had heard about Mkhize’s problem and promised to sort it out quickly. READ: WE POKE FOR NYAOPE! Nzimande said water monitors’ contracts were renewed by councillors every year because they reported to them. ANC regional chairman Zamo Nxumalo said he would call both Mtolo and Dlamini to a meeting to resolve their problems. Councillor Dlamini said it was true that he didn’t renew Mkhize’s contract. He confirmed there were political problems between him and Mtolo, which led to problems in the area. Mtolo said political differences shouldn’t affect service delivery.
