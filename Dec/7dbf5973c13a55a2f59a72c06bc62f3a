NEW Joburg mayor, Geoff Makhubo, and his mayoral committee were sworn in yesterday. Makhubo appointed on Saturday five MMCs from the ANC and five from the opposition parties that helped the party reclaim the municipality. He said the ANC would continue with the job it started before losing the Metro to a DA-led coalition. “I don’t think everything that was done in the past three years was bad. Every administration has its strengths and weaknesses,” said Makhubo. His main priority was to stabilise the city’s finances. Living conditions needed to be improved and recent floods were a wake-up call. “We want to go back to basics and bring people closer to the city so that the rich and poor are integrated,” he said. The new ANC mayor’s rise to power has not been without controversy. He has a cloud hanging over his head after corruption allegations were levelled against him. The EFF has rejected his appointment. “I don’t deal with threats. Those who don’t want to work with us and want to be outside, the communities will see them for what they are,” he said. Finance MMC Jolidee Matongo said he’d look into what funds were available to run the city. “We still stand by statements we made regarding the city’s financial crisis, and we need to fix them so we can deliver quality services to the people,” he told the People’s Paper. Matongo said the city’s finances would be made known to the public.
