INTERIM SA Under-20 national team coach Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele will hope his efforts in guiding the team to a second-place finish at the Cosafa Championship in Zambia, will be enough to earn him the job permanently. Mkhalele, who was the assistant to former coach Thabo Senong when Amajita won the tournament twice in a row, could not make it a hat trick of titles after his side were beaten 3-0 by hosts Zambia in the final played at Nkoloma Stadium in Lusaka on Saturday. Nevertheless, the 50-year-old former Orlando Pirates winger appears to have made a good impression, especially with the young and relatively inexperienced team he took to the tournament. Mkhalele is optimistic about the future as he will look to be the man at the helm when the same team embarks on a journey to qualify for the 2021 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations to be staged in Mauritania. “The tournament was great in terms of tracking talent,” said Mkhalele. “We have just identified some players that we brought into this new team who responded well to the demands of the tournament. “I’m really proud of the boys even though we did not defend our title like we had hoped. However, they have gained a lot of experience and have shown a lot of growth. “We believe that this team will be much stronger in a year from now when we play the Cosafa to qualify for the Afcon in 2021. “The tournament has also helped me as a coach to map our way forward together with my technical team as we look forward to what lies ahead for this team.” As Mkhalele waits to learn his fate from Safa regarding the Amajita job, his former teammate and Bafana Bafana legend Lucas “Rhoo” Radebe believes there is no better man for the job. “I think he has done a great job,” said Radebe. “As former players, we can come back and contribute in a meaningful way. And with Helman being in those structures is brilliant.”
