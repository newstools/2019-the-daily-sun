I want a man who will not cheat on me,” said the singer, whose real name’s Ndivhudzannyi Ralivhona. Although Makhadzi is tired of watching other women take her men, she told Daily Sun she’d never take someone else’s man as she respected other women. “I’ve been in a relationship since December last year and wouldn’t be looking for any love if my man changed. I’m not a playground, but a woman who needs to be loved. I need a man who will love me and be trustworthy.” Makhadzi advised men to stop hurting their partners by cheating on them. When asked about her hit song Matorokisi, the 23-year-old from Limpopo said if a man married a woman with children, the children were his and he should take care of them. “They must all move like a train with the man being the engine,” said Makhadzi. “The song’s opened doors for me. Fans are excited and can’t stop talking about it.” READ: FANS LASH BLACK COFFEE! She said she was thankful to Master KG and King Monada, who introduced her to Limpopo house music. She said she didn’t write songs but just listened to the beats and recorded at the same time. She released her debut album Matorokisi last month.
