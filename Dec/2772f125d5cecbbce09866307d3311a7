MULTI-award winning star, Sia bought people groceries at supermarkets. The singer who is best known for her hit songs Chandelier and Titanium normally wears wigs that cover her hair and face when performing, during public appearances and on stage went out as herself and told people her name was Cici. The Australian starÂ went to different supermarkets, offering to pay for people's groceries saying it's because she won the lottery. People took videos act of the charity and posted them on their social media platforms. On one of the videos shared, she is seen paying for groceries and then moving on to ask "Who's next?". On some videos, the people she helped are seen thanking her, hugging her and taking pictures.  @siamusic this a picture with you and my daughter what you did for us last night i will never forget our car broke down 2months ago we a a month out from losing our trailer but you have given us the best thanksgiving and restored our lost faith. With all of our love and gratitude Terri Palacios. A post shared by  Terri Jo Palacios (@terripalacios) on Nov 28, 2019 at 11:46am PST
