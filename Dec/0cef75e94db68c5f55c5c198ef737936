The say that everyone has a twin that can be true. This was proved yesterday after Twitter users came across Maya Christinah Xichavo Wegerif, known as Sho Madjozi’s lookalike on Twitter. The user, who goes by the name of Sense Lizhumor, shocked many people on social media after she uploaded photos of herself that resemble with Sho Madjozi. They all jumped in with excitement and shared their thoughts about her. The majority of people even thought it was the John Cena hitmaker with her fans. Sense Lizhumor from New York City took to twitter denying that she doesn’t look like the singer and people should stop comparing her with the singer. Her tweet read: “Bro, she’s beautiful but I honestly don’t see the resemblance. We’re just 2 fair skinned black women with long hair. Y’all really going hard with this lol.”
