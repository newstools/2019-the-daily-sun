THE family of Comfort Kubayi said the wheels of juctice were grinding too slowly. It’s alleged Comfort (27) was gunned down by a cop (46) during a raid on his home in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. Comfort was a suspect in a theft investigation. According to his 63-year-old dad Robert, Comfort was shot and killed in March 2010 by a cop. “They came for him during the night and raided my house. Comfort was asleep,” he said. “It’s clear his death meant nothing as the suspect still works as a cop and is not facing murder charges.” The matter was set to resume in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Wednesday, but prosecutor Lot Mgiba recused himself. Apparently, it was the accused himself who submitted case dockets to Mgiba, an apparent conflict of interest. But Magistrate Betty Lesufi said the Kubayi family would be informed about the next court date. She said this would depend on when another prosecutor would be assigned to the murder case.
