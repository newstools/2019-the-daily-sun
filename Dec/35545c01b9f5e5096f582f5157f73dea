ANGRY nurses and forensic pathologists at Tintswalo Hospital in Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga downed tools after they didn’t get performance bonuses. According to the workers, the money was supposed to have been paid last Thursday. Yesterday, cops were called in after the gate was barricaded and patients were left unattended.

They claimed the CEO failed to address the issue and didn’t have answers to their questions. Speaking to Daily Sun, nurses said they received letters stating when they should be paid, but nothing has been received so far. They said since last week, they’ve been trying to get to the bottom of the matter, but no one told them anything.  “Some of the staff received bonuses while some of us who perform important duties received nothing. We want our Christmas bonuses as well so we can provide for our families. If this matter is not attended to, we will call for a total shut down,” said a worker. Nehawu regional secretary Edward Mashego said 177 of their members didn’t get performance bonuses and the department didn’t give them any explanation, which then led to the protest.
