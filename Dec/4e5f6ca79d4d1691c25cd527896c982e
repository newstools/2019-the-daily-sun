THE house of SACP branch secretary Reuben Mabunda was ransacked by thugs on Wednesday in his presence. However, the last thing he remembers about that day was watching soccer in his living room. The 52-year-old from ward 31 in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said he was surprised to wake up in his bed and find his house covered in thick smoke and reeking of the smell of muthi. He said he also noticed fluid on his doorstep. His cellphone had also been broken into small pieces. “My giant plasma TV was also missing and the thieves appear to have also stolen R100 from my wallet,” he said. Mabunda said neighbours said they saw people drive off in a white bakkie. He said the intruders must have used some muthi to make him sleep.  “I had left the gate and the front door open as I was watching soccer. “I don’t know how I fell into such a deep sleep,” said Mabunda. He’s now pleading with the community to help the cops find and arrest the suspects. Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu said it was common for criminals to use muthi to make people fall into a deep sleep to steal from them. “This is a wake-up call to residents this festive season. They must be vigilant and guard their belongings at all times,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said a case of burglary was under investigation. No one has been arrested. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Mhala police on 013 773 0331.
