EVENT promoter Kaone Modise claims Ngwaneso Ngwaneso singer TallArseTee owes him R14 000. According to Kaone, the singer failed to show up to Rockville Spring Festival in Morokweng Village, North West, last September. Kaone (27) of Modkay Projects Company said he begged TallArseTee to give back the money he was paid to perform. He said he realised the singer was double booked from his WhatsApp status a few days before the event. “When I asked him why he had other bookings on the same day as my gig, he told me not to worry as he would manage,” he said. Kaone said TallArseTee was booked to perform from 3am to 4am.  “When I called him at 2am, he didn’t answer. I thought he would call to explain, but he never did,” he said. Kaone said when he finally got hold of the singer, he claimed his manager had been trying to get hold of him to say he was in a car accident. “He said he needed money to pay his insurance excess and didn’t have any cash. Instead, he offered to play for free at my next gig,” said Kaone. TallArseTee said: “I had a delay in payment because I changed my management team. “I will make sure he gets his money by the end of the week.”
