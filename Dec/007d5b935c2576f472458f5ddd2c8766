Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne says the only way for the defending Premier League champions to close the gap to Liverpool would be to continue winning games the Pep Guardiola way. The champions have not yet given up on a third successive Premier League title but, as they trail leaders Liverpool by 11 points having played a game more, they are not thinking about the gap. De Bruyne, outstanding in City's recent back-to-back wins over Arsenal and Leicester, just wants to focus on playing in the fluid style that has been their hallmark under manager Guardiola. The Belgium international said: "We need to go game by game. We've dropped some points along the way, but I think the reaction of the team has always been really good, the way we play has always been the same and we have played good football. This is the way to go forward. "This is the way we have played four seasons with Pep Guardiola and this is not going to change. "We work hard, and we dedicate a lot to play well and if this is the way we play, people will enjoy it. We just try to win game by game and at the end of the season, we will see what happens. "If we don't win it, we don't win it, but we work and play hard every day, and this is the way to go forward." City are next in action on Friday night as they travel to Wolves for their first of two games in less than 48 hours. Their second sees them host Sheffield United on Sunday. Guardiola likes to take each game as it comes but admits the close proximity of these two fixtures means selection for one could affect the other. The City boss said: "It's the best way, to think about the next game, so you are not too distracted. "But still I didn't think which players are going to play. I'm thinking of the next game against Sheffield United because we have less than 48 hours." Wolves beat City at the Etihad Stadium in October - one of the reasons why they have fallen behind Liverpool - and Guardiola expects another stern test.
