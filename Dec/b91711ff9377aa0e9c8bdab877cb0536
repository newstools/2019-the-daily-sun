ENTREPRENEUR Dimakatso Nakumba has set her mind on making a dent on and leaving a mark in the hospitality industry. The businesswoman from Spruitview, in Ekurhuleni, opted to go into entrepreneurship after quitting her job. Said Dimakatso: “I was tired of working as an artisan and doing standby for the past 15 years, as I was expected to wake up in the middle of the night to work. “So, I came up with a plan. Luckily, a friend invited me to her place, took me on a tour of her guest house business and gave me tips on how to start and run the business. “Later, I bought a site with the money I got when I left my job.” Dimakatso’s business, Emlangeni Guesthouse, began operating in April. “I’m on a new chapter and the sky is no limit for me,” she said. “Despite the competition, our unique style, set up and the fact that hygiene is our priority makes us different. And with my three employees, we ensure our customers get the best service.” The businesswoman said she relied on social media and word of mouth to market her business. “In life, if you want to be successful, don’t allow fear and failure to overcome your vision,” Dimakatso said.
