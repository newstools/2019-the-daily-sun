ORLANDO Pirates coach Glen Salmon says there will be no sympathy when his side take on Black Leopards in their last Multichoice Diski Challenge match for the year. Leopards are the only team that have not won any match since the league started. Lidoda Duvha are rooted at the bottom of the log with six points from 17 outings. The Venda-based team will be hoping to give their loyal fans a Christmas gift by winning their first ever MDC match against Pirates. The massive festival, which has been dubbed Gauteng versus Limpopo, will take place at Kabokweni Stadium in Nelspruit on Monday (11am). Salmon has cautioned his lads not to rest on their laurels as they need to close the gap. He said: “Our youngsters know the importance of going into the break with a win. “The win will help narrow the point-gap between us and the leaders. “We know Leopards are struggling but we going there to do what’s best for us to achieve our goal as a team.” Since the arrival of Salmon from Bidvest Wits in August, Pirates have shown notable improvements. The Buccanners occupy fourth spot in the table, having accumulated 33 points in their 17 matches. As part of the festival, Baroka FC will tackle log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at 11am, and Polokwane City will play the last match of the day against Kaizer Chiefs at 3pm. Sundowns will go to recess leading the log, and Bidvest Wits will remain second as both teams have gathered more than 40 points which no team can match this weekend.
