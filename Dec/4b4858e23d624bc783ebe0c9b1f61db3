Now the 75-year-old from Tweespruit, Free State, believes she’s being punished by her ancestors because she’s not visited her husband’s grave in more than a year. She told Daily Sun her problems started when a mlungu recently took her cows and demanded R45 000 to return them.  “Even though I paid the money, my cows keep dying like flies. “My late husband visited me in my sleep last year and showed me I needed to visit his grave. But whenever I wanted to something would come up,” she said. “I believe the ancestors are punishing me. I’ve visited the grave and even performed a ritual, but the cows keep dying. I’m left with only 18. “I hope my ancestors will forgive me before I’m left with nothing.” Mann Oilrich, the farmer who took gogo’s cows, confirmed he received the money. He said Ntshiuwa had to pay him for his feed while they were in his care. READ: WATCH: HOW I FLED ANELE’S KILLER! “Ntshiuwa is not telling the truth when she says I took her cattle.
