Thirty-six-year-old Lisa Snyder (36), who was arrested on Monday morning, had told police her eight-year-old son had been bullied at school and was suicidal. A police investigation found no evidence of bullying. The investigation also showed the boy had a physical disability that would have made it nearly impossible for him to hang himself. “Eight-year-olds, generally that I’m aware, don’t commit suicide,” John T Adams, the Berks County district attorney, said during a media conference on Monday. “So, of course, we had questions.” Snyder, who was also charged with two counts of endangering the welfareof children and one count of tampering with evidence and is being held without bail, has denied killing her children and maintains they committed suicide.
