A man was killed while in the process of
robbing Stokvel members their hard earned cash. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela
Mojapelo said a group of the local Stokvel members were in a house busy sharing
the money they had saved for the entire year when about four suspects suddenly
broke the window, entered the house and pointed them with firearms. The incident happened in Majosi village
in Hlanganani outside Giyani. He said one of the Stokvel members
somehow managed to send a message to a person who was at the Satellite Police Station
which is situated in the same village. This person then informed the cops and
they rushed to the scene. The suspects allegedly started shooting
at the cop on their arrival at the scene and he shot back, instantly killing
one of the robbers. A pistol was allegedly recovered from
him. Mojapelo said with the bank notes flying
and scattering around the scene, one of the suspects was apparently shot and
injured during the process and was hastily carried away by the other suspects
who loaded him into a vehicle that sped off. The police member was not injured. The Provincial Commissioner of Limpopo,
Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has commended this brave member for
singlehandedly taking on the armed robbers who busy robbing Stokvel members. Ledwaba continued to warn community
members, especially those who are involved in Stokvel activities, to desist
from the tendency of withdrawing large sums of money and then sharing it
amongst themselves at home. The banks should instead be used to make
transactions where these monies could be transferred into individual accounts. Cases of House Robbery and an Inquest
have been opened and police investigations are continuing. The hunt for the remaining suspects is
continuing and anyone with information is requested to contact the nearest
police or call the Crime Stop number 0860010111.
