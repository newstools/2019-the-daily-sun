FORMER North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has expressed disappointment in society’s treatment of women and children. Mahumapelo said youth should enjoy themselves and be allowed to go to taverns, but there should be measures in place to make sure they were protected and safe. “Young people should enjoy their youth but must be taught not to put their lives in danger,” he said. Mahumapelo was speaking during his visit yesterday to the family of Gomolemo Legae (18), who was raped, stabbed 25 times and burnt alive near her home in Seweding Village in Mahikeng, North West. “This is a big disappointment. We must blame ourselves.” He said after he heard about what had happened to Gomolemo, he saw it fit as a resident of Mahikeng and politician to show her family support. He said society neglected the youth. “Young people must be taught how to prepare themselves as people being nurtured to grow and become something in future.” Gomolemo’s aunt Ketlaareng Magashula thanked Mahumapelo for his gesture. “We’re happy someone of his calibre is with us in these trying times,” she said.
