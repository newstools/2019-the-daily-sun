ZODWA Wabantu’s new “in-laws” have accepted her. In an exclusive interview with Daily Sun, Vusi Ngubane’s sisters said Zodwa had become a member of the family. Vusi’s sister Zandile (22) said she was shocked at first when she heard her brother was dating Zodwa. “I didn’t even know how to react to the news. This is because I wasn’t expecting him to know Zodwa in that way,” she said. “I knew Zodwa’s ex-boyfriend Ntobeko Linda, and in my mind they were still dating. “What concerned me most was that Zodwa was about to be married, and suddenly Vusi was telling me he was dating her. “I didn’t want my brother to be in a love triangle, or to find himself in a situation where he would break up someone else’s relationship. “I did my research and found out the truth. I realised Zodwa and Vusi were not just dating but were actually serious.” Zandile said she had misjudged Zodwa after seeing her from a distance. “But when my brother introduced her to me, she was quite the opposite of what I saw. She can be very shy sometimes, but she’s also open at the same time. She’s respectful and very open-minded,” she said. “Our mother was a bit protective and asked her some hard questions, but it was clear he loves her. As a family, we love Zodwa.” Vusi’s older sister Mbali Buthelezi said they could see he was happy with Zodwa. “I’ve interacted with her and she’s a nice person,” she said. Zodwa said she could see the family accepted her. “I’m sure they can see I’m not intending to take their son away and that we found love in each other,” she said.
