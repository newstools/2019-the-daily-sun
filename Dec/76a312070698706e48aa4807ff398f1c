Singer R. Kelly is in hot water with the law again. This time, he is accused of bribing a government official back in 1994 to obtain a fake ID that stipulates that Aaliyah was 18 years-old when he married her. According to BBC News,  a girl only named as Jane Doe  in court documents has been identified by US media as Aaliyah. They got married when she was 15 and R. Kelly was 27. The certificate, leaked at the time, listed her age as 18. R. Kelly, real name Robert Kelly, is accused of paying a bribe to an unnamed Illinois government employee to obtain a fake ID. R. Kelly is facing several sexual abuse charges with trials in Chicago and New York next year. He denies any wrongdoing.The latest criminal indictment was filed by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, and expands on charges filed against him in July. Aaliyah, whose full name was Aaliyah Dana Haughton, died in 2001 in a plane crash at age 22. She is identified in the new indictment only as “Jane Doe #1.”In an interview this year with ABC’s “Good Morning America,” Steven Greenberg, Mr. Kelly’s lawyer, said his client had “no idea” Aaliyah was 15 when they married.
