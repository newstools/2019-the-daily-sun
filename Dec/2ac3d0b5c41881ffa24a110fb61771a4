THE two brothers thought they could escape the long arm of the law. But they were mistaken. The pair, linked to several murder and attempted murder cases in KZN, were bust in Joburg and are expected to appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court today. The two, aged 34 and 38, are linked to a series of crimes at KwaMashu Hostel and in Inanda, north of Durban. KZN police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said the first suspect was arrested for illegal possession of ammunition. He was nabbed during a court appearance in Cleveland, Joburg. The second was arrested at his hideout at Denver Hostel, also in Joburg, he said. KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula said: “We’re focusing on repeat offenders and, during our festive season operations, we’re going to ensure wanted criminals are not allowed to roam freely.”
