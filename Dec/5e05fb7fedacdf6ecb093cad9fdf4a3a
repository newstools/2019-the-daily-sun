The 35-year-old was moered by an angry crowd on Sunday after he allegedly confessed to residents and cops in Jane Furse, Limpopo, that he had killed his child and buried him in his yard in Ngwana-Matlala Village. The man, originally from Lesotho, apparently started taking care of the child two weeks ago after his mum got a job in Joburg. He allegedly attacked the boy after he demanded food. A neighbour said the man tried to run away while residents were questioning him. “He confessed to the murder and pointed out where he buried his son after they assaulted him. As neighbours, we became worried after seeing him hanging around without his son,” the neighbour said. “At first, he lied and said the boy went back to his mum in a taxi. When we asked for the mum’s contact details, he wouldn’t give them.” READ: BLACK COFFEE BROKE UP WITH ENHLE MBALI VIA EMAIL!
