Just like racism, tribalism is a crime against humanity. If Penny Sparrow could be prosecuted for racism, so could anyone who practises tribalism. Limpopo Sports, Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka is one such person. Moraka, a non-Tsonga-speaking ANC politician, made blatantly tribalistic and disparaging remarks about Tsonga musical icon Dr Thomas Chauke at the recent Maphungubwe Cultural Festival. What’s tragic is Premier Stan Mathabatha jumping to her defence. It seems there are people in the ANC who still believe in the failed homeland system. The ANC is being used as a vehicle to pursue narrow interests. That festival incident must not be reduced to a mere MEC Moraka versus Dr Chauke issue. It’s a national issue that parliament must debate. Limpopo is riddled with tribalistic tendencies, but civil society groups don’t have the ability to tackle the scourge. They’re failing the next generation. Moraka must be investigated and given the opportunity to prove her innocence in a court of law, just like Sparrow and company. If South Africa is indeed a constitutional democracy, let the rule of law apply equally to everyone. Letter from Solani Mashimbye in Waterval, Elim
