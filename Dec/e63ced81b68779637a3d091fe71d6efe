PROPHET Ariel Ting said he saw his own death. He’s afraid as he knows what will happen to him and many other people. The 43-year-old from Sebokeng in the Vaal said God had given him the gift of vision.“I see things as they are going to happen before they do,” he said. Ariel claimed he saw the xenophobic attacks earlier this year before they happened and he could also see the deaths of family members, close friends and neighbours. “With the deaths, I keep quiet and try to pray for those people because some of them are not emotionally ready for such things.” Ting said after seeing his own death, he was afraid and restless. “A huge storm will come from the west, not more than five months from now. There will be a huge tornado and it will take a lot of people.” Ting said there would be terrible floods and people would be buried. “I see them crying for help and drowning, both adults and children. I see myself and my family also being taken by the floods.” Ting said he got up early every morning to go to a nearby mountain to pray. “I am afraid. I want to warn people about this storm. If I survive it, I will be grateful.” Neighbour Bonga Sangweni (50) said Ting told her about her mum’s death seven months before it happened. “I didn’t take it seriously and when my mum died, I remembered,” she said. Sonto Linda said Ting told her about the xenophobic attacks before they happened.
