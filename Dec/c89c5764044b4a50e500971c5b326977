PENSIONERS in Seshego, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, spend their days playing morabaraba. They said indigenous games kept the mind busy and active. Mishack Mnisi (67) told Daily Sun he started playing the game several years ago. Despite being kept busy, the games also creates good spirit among us,” he said. Madala Mishack said every community had its own challenges, and they were able to address them while playing. He said it was crucial children be taught to play indigenous games. “Since most of these games are played in groups, we believe children can learn some social skills from them,” he said. Peter Rakgate (59) said it worried them to see the youth roaming the streets and committing crime, while there were many things they could keep themselves busy with. He said he believed playing such games would help keep them alive. “It’s crucial that we protect our indigenous games because they’re part of our culture,” he said.
