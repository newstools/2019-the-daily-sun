Maybe I might be lucky.” Donald told the People’s Paper he wasn’t being serious. He said: “This was just a joke for Twitter, because it’s a fun space. “It’s all about fun and games. People never take things seriously and I didn’t think they would take this seriously. I can find love on my own if I want it. “I would never find love on TV. It’s not me. It’s unconventional and I would never go about it that way. I can find a partner by myself. If I were to get a reality show of such a nature, it would just be for fun and entertainment.” He said he got offers to do reality shows previously. “A lot of productions have asked me to be on their reality shows but I declined. But I would consider it if the timing is right. But still, it wouldn’t be to find love, it would just be for entertainment. So if the right deal comes, I would consider it,” said the singer.
