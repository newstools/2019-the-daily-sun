AFTER expressing their concerns about giant potholes, motorists can now use the road without any problems! They won’t be forced to drive over the pavement anymore and worry about their cars being damaged. The road in KwaMashu K section, which had huge potholes filled with muddy water, has finally been fixed. It happened just after Daily Sun ran the story of how the potholes worried both drivers and residents. READ: A NIGHT OF ROADSIDE HELL! Resident Thulani Mkhize (35) said when he saw the road to be fixed, he was excited as it continued being a problem, despite it being reported to the councillor. “But just after Daily Sun published the story, it was fixed. We really appreciate the great work of the paper.” Motorist Nomkhosi Khanyile (45) said she was glad she could now drive on that road. “It used to bother me a lot each time I drove past that area, because it meant driving on the pavement. “Sometimes we had to wait for other cars to drive past because it wasn’t easy for two vehicles to drive there at once,” she said. Nomkhosi said if it weren’t for the People’s Paper, they’d still be suffering. “That road is very busy as cars and buses also use it. I’m sure everyone is happy and pleased.”
