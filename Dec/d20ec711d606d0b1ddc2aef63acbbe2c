Kaizer Chiefs defender Erick Mathoho says they have the utmost respect for opponents Bloemfontein Celtic as they prepare to clash in thee Absa Premiership at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday night. Chiefs hold a massive 10-point lead going into the fixture and will be heavy favourites to secure the victory, but come up against an unpredictable Celtic side that currently occupy fifth position and have shown they can be more than a match for any team in the division. “It’s not going to be easy. They are a good team with good players, but every game is tough, and we have to focus and put all our efforts into winning the game,” Mathoho told his club’s website. “We have two matches left for the year and if we can win them, the festive break will be a happy one for us. It is going to take a lot of hard work for us to win the points, we ready for the challenge.” Mathoho, who rose to prominence at Celtic before joining Chiefs in 2012, is likely to replace Siyabonga Ngezana in the side after returning from suspension, but admits the youngster is in top form. “I felt Siyabonga Ngezana had a really good game against Stellenbosch. Now it’s the coach’s decision as to who will start. I was very impressed by him and the way he played scoring a goal and his overall performance, I must compliment him as a young player, he did very well,” Mathoho said.
