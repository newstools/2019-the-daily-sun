MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says he has no shame at all if he benefited from the referees when they won the Telkom Knockout trophy on Saturday. Sundowns lifted the 2019 Telkom Knockout via controversy after Judas Moseamedi's last minute goal was ruled off-sides by the match referee. The goal would have been the 2-2 equaliser and that would have sent the match into extra-time. Said Mosimane during the post-match interview with Supersport: "I thought it was a goal and my heart stopped. I was happy when the linesman raised his flag for off-sides. If I benefited, I have no shame because some people have been getting all these benefits. I have no emotions on the refereeing, the PSL is a jungle. If I have to benefit for five games, I'll gladly take it home. Other teams have benefited in a series of matches, It's my chance and congratulations to Sundowns."
