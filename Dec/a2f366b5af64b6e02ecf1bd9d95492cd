Four arrested, and one police officer injured during a protest by angry  Geelhout Park residents this morning. Geelhout Park residents went on a protest over a lack of clean clean water. Residents say have been living without consistent supply of clean tap water for several years and demanded that the issue be resolved. One resident said "Water is a basic human need affecting every aspect of our lives.Nationally this constitutional right is being undermined for various reasons." Earlier, protesters used large storms and free branches to block the road to the area. Police also used rubber bullets to disperse protesting residents. "The issue with water has been going on for a while now ," said community leader, Yolisa Mdangai. She said they were worried about hygiene.." The municipality need to do something. It's been three months and we can take it anymore." Police Spokesman Captain ,Sam Tselanyane confirmed that four people were arrested. All charged with public violence. "When the police arrived the residents had barricaded the road." "They started throwing stones at the police vehicles and one police officer was injured." Rustenburg Local Municipality  Spokesman, David Mage said the Municipality has been aware of the water supply challenges faced by residents of Geelhout Park and upper lying parts of Tlhabane West. He said that the main reason is that the power outages that the City has been experiencing had an adverse effect on our ability to supply residents with water uninterrupted. "The water supply issues were mainly to pump stations that were not functional due to the blackouts thus the system had no water which ultimately will be directed to household,"He said.
