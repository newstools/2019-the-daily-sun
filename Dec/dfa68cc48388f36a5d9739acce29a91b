SANGOMA Sibusiso Mathe is furious with Zahara. The 38-year-old from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, told Daily Sun the artist owed him money. READ: NO CASH FOR RICK ROSS! He had booked her to perform at the End of the Year Music Festival in Khayelitsha, which took place last Saturday, but she didn’t show up. “I’m very unhappy with what she did. I loved her so much but she disappointed me. I never received a proper apology. I just got a phone call to say she was sorry for what happened,” Mathe said. The sangoma had booked a flight from Joburg to Cape Town for Zahara and her manager, but the artist apparently only rocked up after the show.  Mathe claimed he had already paid Zahara an appearance fee deposit of R10 000 of a total R 20 000 she was supposed to be paid for the performance. He said: “I want my money back. I paid her R10 000. My expenses to bring her to Cape Town with her manager is another R10 000. She owes me R20 000.” Fan Zizipho Mlenzane (30), who attended the event, said fans were expecting Zahara to perform. “She is my favourite musician. It was the first time I was going to see her live,” she said. “When she arrived I managed to take a selfie with her and I will cherish the picture.” Zahara’s manager, Oyama Dyosiba, confirmed they were paid R10 000. “We were paid the deposit for her to perform and the remaining amount was to be paid after the event,” said Dyosiba. He said they only agreed to the R 20 000 because they wanted to support a friend. “One of the guys who organised the event is my friend and became Zahara’s friend through me, so we agreed to perform for that amount. This is far less than Zahara’s performance fee.” READ: ANDILE GUMBI'S SON SHOT!
