Overspending during the festive season can make the start of a new year a bad one. One needs a financial plan to see through the festive season, otherwise you’ll be forced to take on unnecessary debt. The temptation to overspend is always there because the festive season is all about celebrating with family and friends. But you should try to be financially disciplined. People overspend to meet the family’s needs and wants. The temptation to splurge on things we don’t really need grows. Take into account that the economy is stagnant. Although it feels great to treat ourselves and loved ones to expensive gifts and holidays, the reality is that we live in tough economic times. Overspending during December causes anxiety in January. This may mean you begin the new year in debt. We need to stop buying luxury goods on credit or store cards. The interest rates are high and accumulating more debt will only increase the monthly expenses in the future. Although the holiday season is a time for giving and celebrating, it’s important not to be tempted to spend money you don’t have. Pretoria North
