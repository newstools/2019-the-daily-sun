Mpho Makola's six-month ban has been overturned. The Cape Town City's midfielder was initially handed a six-month ban from football after assaulting a match referee during an Absa Premiership encounter with Kaizer Chiefs in October.However the ban has been overturned by SAFA's appeals board and was turned into a four-match suspension. The 33-year-old has already missed Absa Premiership games against Bloemfontein Celtic, Highlands Park, Chippa United and Bidvest Wits. Makola is now eligible to feature for the Citizens in their next game when they take on Baroka FC in their first game of the new year.
