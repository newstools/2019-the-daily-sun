Orlando Pirates' new head coach Josef Zinnbauer is a German tactician who has played and coached in the Bundesliga but is better known as a reserve team coach. The 49-year-old Zinnbauer began his playing career at FV Wendelstein in a career that included teams in the top-flight of German football such as Karlsruher SC and Mainz. Zinnbauer was forced to end his active career at the age of 26 because of cartilage damage and thereafter became a coach. From 2005 to 2010 he oversaw VfL Oldenburg in the fourth division, then was hired as a co-coach with Uwe Rapolder of Karlsruher SC's reserve side. In 2014 he joined Hamburg as the reserve team head coach but after an impressive start was drafted in to take charge of the first team for the 2014/2015 season. In his first game in charge Zinnbauer led Hamburg to an impressive 0-0 draw against Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich. Hamburg though suffered a below average season under Zinnbauer and narrowly escaped relegation via a relegation/promotion playoff after finishing the season in 16th position. Zinnbauer returned the next season to take charge of the Hamburg reserve team before being appointed as head coach at Swedish side FC St. Gallen on September 15, 2015 until 2017. Zinnbauer is yet to lift a trophy as a head coach during his senior professional coaching career.
