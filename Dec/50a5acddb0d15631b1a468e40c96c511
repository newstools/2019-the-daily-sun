POLICE Minister Bheki Cele yesterday pulled a taxi off the road, calling it a coffin on wheels. Monitoring the Safer Festive Season campaign on the N4 in Mpumalanga, Cele said the taxi was not safe for passengers or other road users. “This isn’t roadworthy. You want us to bury people on the 25th? “You won’t make it to Jozi. You’re going to the grave,” he told the driver. The taxi had broken seats and the wheels and engine were in bad condition. Passenger Mpho Sello (38) said everything in the taxi was falling apart. “This is very bad because should we be involved in crash, we aren’t going to survive.” Mpho said before they boarded the taxi, passengers complained to the driver about its condition but he ignored them. He apparently gave them toilet paper to clean the seats. Mpumalanga was the first province Cele visited since the campaign launch. He said he’d visit other parts of the country soon. “I am fine with the progress so far. We’re not going to arrest criminals if they aren’t on the road. That we have arrested people means fewer criminals are on the road,” he said. “We must not get discouraged. We must stay here until we arrest everybody we need to and make our communities safe.”
