VUYOKAZI “Vovo” Nguqu from Forest Village in Cape Town is a happy soul after she received donations. On 18 November, Daily Sun ran a story about the 32-year-old getting the new house President Cyril Ramaphosa promised her. “I’m happy people are coming forward to help,” she said. “I was stressed about getting furniture and other things. People showed me love.” Vovo told Daily Sun she was shocked and excited when she got a call from Asaza Funeral Services manager Leonard Ncumbese, asking what she’d like them to buy for her. “He came from East London to meet me after seeing my video on social media, where I was asking for donations. She met Leonard and spoke about what they’d buy for her. “I told him I wanted a fridge, wardrobe and a washing machine and, indeed, he bought what I asked for. “I’m grateful to Daily Sun for publishing my story.” Leonard was touched by what Vovo said in the video. “The fact that she didn’t get a job because of her small voice made me realise how difficult life is.” He said he’d spoken to the Zibonele Community Radio manager to get more people to donate. “This is another way of giving back to the community. “We’re where we are because of their support. It’s only fair to help where we can.” Vovo got a stove, pillows and a duvet from the radio station.
