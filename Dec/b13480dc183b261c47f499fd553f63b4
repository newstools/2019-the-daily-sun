IT was a joyous Sunday morning for over 70 amatshitshi. They received certificates as proof that they had remained virgins. The girls from various parts of Gauteng braved the rain and gathered at Mai Mai in Jeppestown, Jozi. Among them was Constable Khangekile Gabela (23), originally from Estcourt in the KZN Midlands. She is stationed at the Joburg Central Police Station. She said she had been part of amatshitshi since she was five. Said Khangekile: “The group has taught me how to take care of my body.” The constable said she received a car from her parents during her umemulo as a token of appreciation. “My goal is to remain itshitshi until I become unkosikazi,” she said. Another itshitshi, Lindokuhle Simelane, a public relations practitioner (26) from Troyevile outside Jeppestown, said she was part of this year’s reed dance at Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma. She said she passed her virginity test with flying colours! “I lead by example,” she said. According to Jabu Mangena, president of Buhlebentombi Mai Mai, the group was established 15 years ago by the late gogo Bazamile Ntenza. Jabu said she was the late gogo’s deputy and part of her duties included walking amatshitshi during the annual reed dance at the Zulu king’s palace. “I now teach good morals and behaviour to the girls,” she told the People’s Paper. “I promote respect and ensure they remain virgins until marriage. “We prepare them for the annual reed dance and teach them how to cook and make traditional beer. Jabu said they were happy with the number of parents who brought their kids to the group. “It’s not only Zulu girls. Some of the girls are from other ethnic groups.”
