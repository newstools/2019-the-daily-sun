I’m concerned about the 28 000 people who lost their jobs between July and September. We should be worried about the latest unemployment rate released by Stats SA. Not being able to provide for your family is stressful. Our stagnant economy is not helping the situation. Many more people are going to lose their jobs as long as there are no plans to save jobs. Being unemployed means you have to rely on other people for the things you used to do yourself when you were employed. Recently, President Cyril Ramaphosa retrenched more than 20 workers at one of his farms in Mpumalanga. He’s not helping the situation. It’s tough out there, so he must practise what he preaches. How are we going to take him seriously when he talks about solving the unemployment crisis while laying off workers? ) Due to large-scale retrenchments in industries including media, banking, mining and manufacturing, thousands have joined the unemployment line and face a bleak Christmas. We have a jobs crisis that needs innovative and committed leaders to turn the ship around so more people can reclaim their dignity. This letter wins R200.
