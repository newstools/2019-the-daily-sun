SOUTH Africa attempts of completing a hat-trick in the Cosafa Under-20 Championship failed when they suffered a heavy 3-0 defeat to hosts Zambia in the final on Saturday afternoon. Jonathan Munaluna brace and Francisco Mwepu goasl ensured that the hosts win the title for the 12th time in the history of the tournament. Amajita coach Helman Mkhalele made only two changes to the side that beat Madagascar on penalties in the semi-finals, as Keletso Sifama and Vusimuzi Plamana earned starts. The early exchanges produced fireworks, as the hosts were putting pressure on Amajita and goalkeeper Bontle Molefe had to make a series of saves to keep South Africa in the match. However, Molefe was finally beaten six minutes before the break as Manalula broke the deadlock for Zambia with an overhead kick. Amajita were hit on a counter-attack by the hosts with Mwepu doubled the lead with three minutes before the half-time break. Manaluna got the third goal for the hosts to complete his brace with six minutes remaining which ensured Zambia win the title.
