The show also features Ncipha Bugebengu every Monday, when she invites former convicts to share their stories. Lady D started presenting on Ukhozi FM in 1994 when she was still a nurse. “I had a once-a-week slot about family planning. I became very close to the listeners and went on to present a women and children’s programme called Kumnandi Ekhaya.” Lady D is involved in community activities. She runs the Lucky Dube Trust, which looks after the reggae musician’s estate to ensure his widow survives and his kids go to school.  She’s a member of the Zulu kingdom royal committee. “Together with the team, I take care of the reed dance and every year I interview the king through the station.” Through radio, Lady D started focus groups such as Sheilas and Amajukuku to empower rural women and hostel dwellers.
