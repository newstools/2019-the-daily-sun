THEY thought they’d get away with their scam after robbing a gogo but sadly for them, it didn’t work. A woman, who pretended to be a worker at a well-known supermarket in Kimberley, Northern Cape, was pulled by her braids, klapped and beaten with a shoe by gogo Masenyana Ncube (75). “She rubbed me with muthi then scammed me of R800,” said gogo. “I was waiting in the queue to pay for my groceries when a woman dressed in the store uniform told me about food parcels being sold at the back door. “She told me to leave my trolley and go with her, which I did.  “She was with an elderly woman with her who told me she also worked at the store,” she said. She said they started rubbing her with a black liquid-like muthi that made her give them R800. “I still had R1 000 in my bag. I don’t remember how I gave it to them. They told me to go back in the queue and wait but they didn’t return.” She was stranded without transport money.  “I went to the police and there was another woman who was also scammed of R700.” The brave gogo searched for the robbers and found them at an ATM. “I only got R1 400 back. I discovered they had my ID and Sassa card.” Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba said the two women appeared in court on Tuesday and the case was postponed to 15 January.
