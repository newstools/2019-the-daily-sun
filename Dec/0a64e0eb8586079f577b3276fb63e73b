PEOPLE came out in their numbers yesterday to remember Nelson Mandela. The former president’s granddaughter, Ndileka, said the turnout for the Madiba Walk in Tshwane showed the country’s hope had not died. “People braved bad weather conditions to take part. Madiba loved fun and you could sense his spirit today.” Ndileka said the rain was symbolic of the tears Madiba would have shed for violence against women and children. “He always said our freedom would not be complete until we could dismantle all forms of oppression against women and children. As women, it’s not yet uhuru for us,” she said. Nearly 20 000 people took part in the half marathon and family fun walk that started and ended at the Union Buildings. Gauteng sports, arts and culture MEC Mbali Hlophe said the event went well. “Madiba embodies not only our struggles but also reminds us to take care of our well-being.” Comrades winner Gerda Steyn won the 21km women’s race, while Collen Mulaudzi won the men’s race. Among the people who participated were former Bafana Bafana captain Aaron Mokoena, former Zambian soccer captain Kalusha Bwalya and musician Kabelo Mabalane. The event was hosted by the Nelson Mandela Foundation in partnership with the Gauteng provincial government. The Foundation communications director Luzuko Koti said the event showed people still loved Madiba.
