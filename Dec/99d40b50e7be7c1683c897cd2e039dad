THE Department of Health on Tuesday launched its festive season readiness campaign. The launch, at the department’s call centre in East London, was aimed at announcing that the department was partnering with the fire department and the police to minimise accidents. Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba said: “What we’re launching here is an integrated programme by most departments and government agencies to ensure our people are safe, healthy and take responsibility.” The MEC said the call centre was recently declared the best in the country. On average, it receives 5 340 calls per day. The calls range from complaints about human resources matters and long queues, to negligence. During her visit, the MEC asked to answer a call from a resident who needed an ambulance. “I was touched by the trauma the callers are under when they call. “I also got to understand the pressure the call centre staff are subjected to,” she said. Gomba said emergency services vehicles would be placed at strategic points along all major routes and hot spots in all districts. There will also be road patrols by the department’s three helicopters. “On major days and during weekends, emergency services will patrol provincial hot spots where beaches are known for drownings and overcrowding,” said the MEC. “We’ll have a total of 447 ambulances available throughout the province. I’m well aware of the challenges faced by staff and I’ve given instructions that these problems be resolved as a matter of extreme urgency.”
