DA leader John Steenhuisen said the homes of ministers should
also be affected by load shedding just like every other citizen of Mzansi. He said lack of motivation from some ministers to fix the
load shedding crisis is because it doesn’t affect them. Steenhuisen was with Tshwane and Cape Town mayors as well
as the Premier of Western Cape when they briefed the media on plans to address
the challenge. “This explains why this Parliament remains closed, if you
don’t feel the pain of load shedding like many of these ministers, addressing
load shedding is not a priority for you. I think shed one shed all should be
the motto when it comes to public representatives,” said Steenhuisen. The DA
leader said he stays at Acacia Park, a parliamentary village that is also
subjected to load shedding. He claimed that some MPs from other political parties do
not reside at the parliamentary village as they claim to. “Unlike some leaders of other political parties who
alleged to live in Acacia Park but actually leave in luxury sea front apartments,
I live in Acacia Park and it has been subject to load shedding,” he said.
Steenhuisen and other DA leaders walked around the Cape Town engaging various
business people on their challenges in running businesses because of blackouts.
