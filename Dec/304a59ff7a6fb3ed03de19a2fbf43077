TSHWANE residents gathered in their numbers to demand that Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa steps down. Led by Sanco, people marched from Marabastad to Tshwane House, where councillors met to decide the mayor’s fate. They held placards written “Mokgalapa Must Go”, some even carrying condoms, saying the mayor must use them. READ:'SEX' MAYOR PLACED ON SPECIAL LEAVE! Sanco Tshwane chairman Abram Mashishi said: “We can’t have a leader followed by one scandal after another. Service delivery in the city has declined dismally and nothing’s been done.” The council meeting was off to a rocky start, with the EFF and the ANC claiming Mokgalapa’s special leave was in violation of policy. But DA chief whip Christo van den Heever said there was nothing unusual about the leave and it was until 29 January. The leave was cancelled after councillors agreed Mokgalapa should reapply. Speaker Katlego Matheba then read a letter from the mayor appointing Abel Tau as acting mayor. The ANC and EFF wanted a motion of no confidence against Mokgalapa, who’as been in the hot seat after an audio clip of him and transport MMC Sheila Senkubuge allegedly having sex hit social media on Sunday. The two claimed the audio was fake and that they had no romantic relationship. They laid charges of invasion of privacy and blackmail against unknown people at Brooklyn Police Station. The ANC has sent a letter to the speaker pleading for a motion of no confidence and saying it would go to court for an urgent interdict if she failed to allow the motion. EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu said the party was also considering legal action to force a motion of no confidence.
