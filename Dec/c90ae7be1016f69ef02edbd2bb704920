POLICE recovered the bodies of three family members who were kidnapped from their home last Monday. The 71-year-old gogo from Lower Tsojana Village in the Eastern Cape, as well as her 16- and 17-year-old granddaughters, were last seen the night before they went missing. Their bodies were found floating in the nearby Mhlahlane River on Saturday by a shepherd. Police were called and divers managed to take the bodies out. They were tied with chains. Police spokeswoman Captain Namhla Mdleleni said the girls’ 19-year-old sister, who was no longer living with them, said she and her two dead sisters were being raped over time by a relative. After she found out one of her sisters was pregnant, she reported the matter to the police and a case of rape was registered. Mdleleni said police had visited the family earlier on Monday to investigate the rape allegation. It’s alleged that after police left, the relative questioned the gogo and her grandkids what the police were looking for. Mdleleni said that was the last time anyone had heard from them and the relative. She said three cases of murder and kidnapping were opened and no arrests had been made. “Police are appealing to anyone who can assist with information that can lead to the arrest of the perpetrators to please contact the toll-free number 08600 10111,” she told the People’s Paper.
