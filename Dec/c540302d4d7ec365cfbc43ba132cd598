 PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa called to congratulate EFF leader commander in
chief Julius Malema for a well-organized elective conference. “He congratulated me for being elected unopposed and said he wished that
could happen to him,” Malema told delegates when he closed the party’s 2nd
National People’s Assembly held at Nasrec in Joburg since Friday and closed
earlier today. Malema said he had got a missed
call from the president in the morning and he called him back. “He asked me to send a message to you to say he has learnt a lot about
how to organize a conference. He then congratulated me and said I see you have
been elected unopposed, it is something I wish for myself,” he said he to a
laughing hall. Malema said Ramaphosa then got him excited when he told him that Fees
Must Fall activist Khaya Cekeshe would be released on parole before Christmas. “The President, when he speaks about Kanya Cekeshe he says this young man
that the EFF has been campaigning for; that he must be released, will be
released. “We thank Ramaphosa for an early Christmas because we have been wanting
to co-exist and learn from people like Kanya Cekeshe. “We thank Ramaphosa for an early Christmas because we have been wanting
to co-exist and learn from people like Kanya Cekeshe,” he said. But in the same breath Malema warned Ramaphosa about his intentions to
sell state owned entities to his ‘friends’. He urged delegates that when they leave the conference, they must be
ready to defenders SOEs. “Ramaphosa, I want to tell you now; that even if you release Kanya
Cekeshe, you are not our friend for what you did to the people of Marikana. You
are not our friend because you want to sell the assets of our people. “And if you want to sell our assets to the (Johan) Ruperts and the
Oppenheimers, we will defend our assets with every6thing, including our bodies.
We will occupy the picket lines in defence of our properties,” he warned.
