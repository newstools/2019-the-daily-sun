WHAT do you think happened next to poor Bryce Moon who attempted to close down dribbling wizard Masibusane Zongo in the above picture? Poor Moon was most probably sent the wrong way by Zongo dribbling trickery. Zongo was one of the most promising and the most talented players the PSL has ever produced. But just like many before him, he did not live up to his huge talent and expectations. He is only 29 years-old and should be still be playing at the highest.  When Matsatsantsa A Pitori unleashed him in 2008, there was huge excitement that a star had finally arrived in the PSL. But the Mthatha-born dribbling wizard did not work hard enough to fight for a placing in the starting line-up. After only 18 games, he was loaned out to Vasco da Gama and then he landed at Bidvest Wits on loan. He later turned out for clubs such as Chippa United, Platinum Stars, Royal Eagles and Extension Gunners in Botswana. Share with us some of your memories of Zongo...
