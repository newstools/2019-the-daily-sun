THE mum of Precious Ramabulana’s alleged killer wants to ask Precious’ family for forgiveness. However, 28-year-old Aubrey Manaka’s family is afraid of how the Ramabulanas will react. WATCH: PRECIOUS RAMABULANA'S 'KILLER' IN COURT! Aubrey’s mum, Ramokone (61) from Nyakelang in Botlokwa in Limpopo, said her family had a meeting on Sunday to decide when they’d go to Venda to meet Precious’ family. The 21-year-old student was stabbed 52 times. “My son confessed in front of me, police, his sister, Lebogang and his nephews that he raped and killed Precious,” said Ramokone. PRECIOUS’ DEATH A NATIONAL SHAME! “Asking the family for forgiveness will not bring her back and I’m not saying my son should get mercy, but it’s what we should do.” Aubrey, the youngest of four siblings, previously spent six years in prison. His sister Lebogang (41) said after he was released on parole, Aubrey lived a normal life. They were surprised when police surrounded their house last Wednesday looking for Aubrey. CYRIL TO VISIT PRECIOUS RAMABULANA'S FAMILY! “He showed the police the knife and a Samsung phone he took,” she said. “There was also the blood-covered clothes he wore on the night of the killing.” Ramokone said on the day of the killing, he had a scar on his left eye. He told them he got hurt at a tavern. “He’d get irritated when we discussed the incident,” she said. “He stopped making breakfast for his nephews, which he normally did before work.” Aubrey appeared in the Morebeng Magistrates Court on Monday.
