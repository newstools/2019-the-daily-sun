MOEKETSI Phejane is proud of himself. The 31-year-old from Joe Slovo in Mangaung runs his business ekasi. He makes different types of drums, shelves and doors from pallets. He told Daily Sun: “I work from home, where I have enough space to work. “I can do anything with wood. I also make mattress bases and they last for many years. “At the moment I’m busy with an order for drums.” The civil engineering graduate from Motheo TVET College said it was difficult to find a job. That’s why he started his company. “I looked for a job after I completing my N6 but couldn’t find one. “I then met Rasta Leon Guard at the Rastafarian church. He taught me to work with my hands to make money. “I’m able to put food on the table with the skills I learnt, such as welding, bricklaying and art.” Moeketsi makes drums for churches, izangoma and drum majorette clubs. “The drums include djembes, which can last up to 20 years. They’re made of cow hides.” He said he also teaches the youth. Moeketsi advised young people to be willing to learn new skills so as to make a living.
