Robin Marie loves is cuddling. From a simple hug to full-on spooning, Marie of Kansas City,
Missouri, makes about R587 000 a year offering professional cuddling services. According South West News Service: SWNS the sessions
last between one and four hours, at R1200 an hour. “It’s very rewarding,” Marie said. “It causes the body to release oxytocin, the ‘bonding
hormone,’ which makes us feel happier and less stressed.” All clients must always be clothed and the relationship is
platonic. “In the summer gym shorts is OK, as long as they come below
the middle of the thighs,” she added. There are many reasons for seeking the
services of a pro cuddler, according to Marie. “I get single people, people who are happily married,
unhappily married, widowed, separation, people in monogamous relationships and
those with multiple partners,” she said.
