BUSINESSMAN Fana Hlongwane has denied allegations that he was present when former deputy minister of finance Mcebisi Jonas was offered a ministerial position by the Guptas. Hlongwane told the Zondo Commission yesterday he heard about the allegations, but knew nothing about it. “At a meeting where I was present, no such happened,” he said. He confirmed that he met Jonas and former president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane at the Gupta compound in Saxonwold, north of Joburg, on 23 October 2015, the date the alleged offer took place. Hlongwane said their meeting came about after Duduzane told him he heard a rumour that Jonas was going around claiming that Hlongwane was blackmailing him. “I asked Duduzane to arrange the meeting because I found the rumour to be improbable because of the relationship I had with Jonas. We’d been friends and comrades,” he said. He said the purpose of the meeting was to clear the air. Hlongwane said the meeting was initially set to take place at the HyattRegency Hotel in Rosebank, but he felt uncomfortable as there’d be no privacy. He claimed Jonas said he didn’t remember ever telling anyone Hlongwane was blackmailing him. Hlongwane said the meeting was brief. According to testimony by Jonas, while the meeting was going on, someone walked into the room and said he knew that Hlongwane was blackmailing Jonas. He said it was during that time that he was allegedly offered the finance minister job, plus R600 million, if he accepted. The offer was apparently in exchange for Jonas to do the family’s bidding once he took office. Hlongwane stuck to his guns and told Zondo that this never happened in his presence. “No offer was made,” he said. He also disputed Jonas’ claim that he left the house shocked and disgusted. “I didn’t see any evidence of that.”
