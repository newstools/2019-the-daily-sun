WHEN her son and his girlfriend started arguing on Saturday, the 91-year-old gogo tried to calm them down. However, the gogo from Tshino, outside Vuwani in Limpopo, was unsuccessful and the fight ended in a bloody death. Her son (45) and his lover Portia Ramakavhi (31) went to their room, and not long after Portia was hacked with an axe. The gogo said she tried to speak to her son, but he threatened to kill her. “I called out to neighbours for help, and when I came back Portia was bleeding. That’s when I went to the police station,” she said. “Portia’s death broke my heart. She died like an animal. There was blood in the doorway as she was trying to run away.” The gogo’s relative said the suspect slept at Portia’s house the previous night. “We don’t know what happened that night, but they got into a serious fight when they arrived here. He was accusing her of dating another man,” she said. “He even called his mother last week to complain that Portia was cheating, but he had no right to take her life.” Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the suspect was arrested and was expected to appear in the Vuwani Magistrates Court soon. He said the suspect was in hospital under police guard after angry residents attacked him .
