Apparel retail group, MRP, launched their new beauty range Scarlet Hill which consists of lipsticks, eyeshadows, contour palettes, makeup brushes fragrances, skincare, nail care and body care but it seems like beauty experts and influencers are not very happy with some of the products.

The official launch of Scarlet Hill was held in Durban and attended by beauty influencers from across SA who seemingly got products to try on.
