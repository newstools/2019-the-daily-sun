MUSIC is a universal language, according to this gospel singer. Brother Philip, whose real name is Philip Magabe, said he loved music because it could reach people from all backgrounds, ages and cultures. Speaking to SunBuzz, Brother Philip said: “I’m all about telling the world my stories and about the things that happen around me. “I love music and the support I get from people.” The singer from Buffelshoek in Mpumalanga, who now lives in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said he was aiming to change the world with his sound. His latest album, Tlogelang Go Bolaya Basadi Le Bana (Stop Killing Women and Children), was released last month. He said with the scourge of gender-based violence in the country, he wanted to condemn the attacks and spread the message around South African taxi ranks and malls. “I perform mostly in local malls and at taxi ranks here in Joburg during weekends. “This is where many things happen and my message will be heard,” he said. His album has songs such as Lehu O Sehlogo and Aswi Lavi Mali. “I was raised and taught well at home. “I preach good things through music and people enjoy listening to me. “Many come to me after my performances and tell me how I touched them,” said Brother Philip. Before he went solo in 2005, he was a member of the ZCC Mokhukhu group since 1990. He said the group taught him about ubuntu and the importance of respecting others. “I want people to know that they can do better. “I have so much respect for people with good hearts and it warms my heart to know I’m part of those who bring changes to the communities,” he said. Brother Philip released his debut album, Rekgopela Kgotso, in 2005. It was followed by Nkarabe Morena in 2009. In 2012, the singer released his third album titled Mme Ke Ga Leboa.
