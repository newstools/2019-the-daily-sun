JMPD spokesman Wayne Minaar has shared some of the worst
excuses motorists give to cops when caught speeding. These are always on the tips of motorists’ tongues when
they are pulled over by cops, especially when they are on the wrong side of the
law. During a freeway patrol, a lady was pulled over for
crossing over a solid barrier line. This is what she had to say, “Sorry officer, I didn’t
know where I was going that’s why I cut over the solid barrier line.” Another common excuse, according to Wayne was one lady
who said she left a pot on the stove, which she forgot to switch off. The lady said she has to rush back to the house quickly
because the pot was left on the stove. “Some said, they are so sick, they have to reach a
toilet. “And others said they are in a hurry because they have an
appointment. But they knew they had an appointment,” he said.
