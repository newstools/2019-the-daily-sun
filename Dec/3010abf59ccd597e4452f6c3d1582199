SEVEN struggling brothers will finally stop sleeping on the floor! The brothers from Botshabelo, Free State, recently received groceries and beds from a Good Samaritan. Daily Sun published their story on 14 December. Their Sassa cards were being held by a relative after she helped to bury their mum in January. The SunTeam visited the family on Christmas Day and only two brothers were home. They said they were happy they would not sleep on the floor anymore and had a lot of food, which they kept with their neighbour. They said a new door was also being installed and their broken windows were being fixed. The family thanked Free State paramedic Lerato Leine for posting their story on Facebook.  One of the brothers (22) showed the SunTeam the bedroom he used to sleep in, which didn’t have a proper floor. But he said that would soon be a thing of the past as cement bags had been donated for the floor to be repaired. “We thank Daily Sun for the stories that touched the Good Samaritan’s heart. We’ve been getting a lot of clothes, groceries and now furniture. “We feel loved. It really feels good to sleep on a bed,” he said. Neighbour Angelina Nyapotse (59) said: “There is lot of food for the brothers. I think when you visit them in a few weeks, they will be chubbier. “I’m keeping the food for them so no one can take advantage and steal from them. They are always welcome at my house.”
