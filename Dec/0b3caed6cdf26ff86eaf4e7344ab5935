WHAT was supposed to be the wedding of the nation, turned out to be a wedding of just a few people, friends and family to be precise. South Africans have been patiently waiting for the KFC wedding, but ‘zijikile izinto’ after the couple opted to have a private wedding. Mzansi’s favourite couple will tie the knot for the second time on the New Year’s Eve, 31 December. After Hector Mkasnsi and Nonhlanhla Soldaat’s engagement video went viral on social media, that prompted people to open their hearts and their wallets, pledging towards helping the couple have the wedding of their dream. Daily Sun donated a sheep voucher worth R2 000 to the couple. Hector told w24 that the venue they are going to use will only accommodate 250 people. He further said that they were planning to make it up to Mzansi by doing a province-to-province tour after their wedding. Mzansi is unlikely to miss the extravaganza wedding because it will because be broadcast live on Eyewitness News. Black Twitter has since exploded out of disappointment for not being invited to the wedding.
