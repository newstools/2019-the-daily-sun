BEING healthy doesn’t end at the gym, especially during the festive holidays. Healthy living and healthy driving are supposed to go hand-in-hand. According to Masterdrive director Eugene Herbert, ensuring you arrive at your destination stress-free and safely, involves three lifestyle issues: nutritious eating, exercise and healthy sleep patterns. Nutrition “In the run-up to your trip, avoid unhealthy foods like takeaways and ensure you follow an eating plan you believe in,” said Eugene. “On the day that you’ll be driving, take time to pack nutritious snacks and water rather than rely on fast food or convenience store snacks. “Irrespective of which eating plan you follow, there are definite foods that one should avoid as these lead to drowsiness or reduce concentration levels. These include not eating at all, eating oily foods that can cause heartburn or stomach problems, spicy and heavy foods like pasta must be avoided.” Sleep Get a good night’s sleep before a long drive. “As soon as you get less than seven hours of sleep you’re affected in a number of ways. If you miss two hours of sleep you double your chances of a crash,” he said. “If you get less than five hours, it’s as dangerous as driving while drunk. If you struggle getting the recommended hours of sleep the night before you leave, rather sleep in and leave a bit later than intended.” Exercise “Ensure you make time for an exercise session the day before you leave,” Herbert said. “If exercise isn’t usually something you do, take time from your packing for a 20-minute walk anyway. “This helps reduce stress levels and improves sleep. Drivers should also take breaks every two hours. “During these breaks, take a brisk walk or do some exercise like jumping jacks which will increase concentration and reduce chances of back or shoulder aches from sitting in the same position for longer.”
