FOLLOWING the barring of several media houses at the EFF's National People's Assembly, eNCA has pulled out from the conference. The unexpected pull out happens as right in the middle of the second day of the EFF's conference taking place in Nasrec, Soweto. Over the years, the party has been criticized for they way they treat certain media house, which the party leaders believe are used as political tools. Earlier today, the channel announced also on Twitter they will no longer be covering the conference. In a series of tweets they said, "eNCA has taken what it believes is a principled decision to stop covering this weekend’s EFF elective conference.This after the party barred several news organizations from covering the event. "These according to the SA National Editors Forum include the Daily Maverick, Scorpio, amaBhungane and Rapport. eNCA has pulled its editorial and technical team from the event in Johannesburg." eNCA Editor Jeremy Maggs  said, "this decision, not taken lightly, is an attack on the media freedom in the country and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms.He says while it’s regrettable the channel will not bring its audience news of the event." Few years ago, the party leaders were criticized by the South African National Editors Forum, after they barred journalists from Gupta owned ANN7 and The New Age from attending their events.
