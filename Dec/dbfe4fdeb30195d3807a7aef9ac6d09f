POLICE bosses have assured the province’s people that there will be police visibility in KZN this festive season. At a meeting in Durban on Wednesday, Transport MEC Bheki Ntuli said over 24 000 cops will be posted around the province. He said: “KZN is a no-nonsense province. We call on all law enforcers to work hard.” He said a festive season safety plan was presented to the justice crime prevention and security cluster last week. He said the KZN’s crime stats were alarming despite the provincial cops’ good work. The MEC said a profile of all taverns situated near schools had been completed by the KZN Liquor Authority. Said Ntuli: “We’ve consistently been in the top 10 leading stations in thse country, which included Inanda, KwaMashu, Umlazi and Plessislaer.” He also said provincial police had earmarked 3 December as the day when operations would be intensified. Resident Nhlanhla Mtolo (45) said he was looking forward to police visibility. He said having police on the beat and on patrol meant he’d stay safe.
