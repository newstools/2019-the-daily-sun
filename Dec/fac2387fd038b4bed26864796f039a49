THE City of Cape Town is not asking refugees to vacate the church they’re occupying but to stop violating by-laws. In court papers, the city accuses them of lighting fires, cooking, eating, doing washing, urinating and defecating outside the church. The respondents are Papy Sukami, JP Balus and Slyvia Nahmana, who have been identified as the group’s leaders. Two weeks ago, businesspeople in the CBD wrote to the city complaining the refugees made it difficult for them to do business. They claimed they urinated and kaked outside the Central Methodist Church, driving away customers. Richard Bosman, the city’s executive director for safety and security, said: “The application brought by the city is to enforce by-laws and deal with any unlawful conduct. “The matter will be heard on Monday. This is not an eviction application.” Sukami accused the city of treating the group inhumanely. “We can be refugees and foreigners, but we’re human beings. We’re asking the city to treat us with dignity,” he said. He said it was unfair the city was taking steps to protect informal traders and other businesspeople but ignored the well-being of refugees sheltered at the church.
