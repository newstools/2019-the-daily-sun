THE new crop of SA Under-20 national team players do not need motivation as they have a lot to play for in the upcoming Cosafa Championship. Not only are they looking to defend the title, which the previous group won twice in as many years, they are also hoping to play themselves into the 2020 Tokyo Olympic-Games bound U-23 team. Young Bafana coach, David Notoane, paid Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele’s youngsters a visit and shared some words of encouragement ahead of their departure for Zambia. Amajita, who left yesterday for the tournament set to kick-off tomorrow until 14 December, have been drawn in Group B alongside Lesotho, Madagascar and Mauritius. They play their first group match against Mauritius on Thursday. “We are here to support coach Helman,” said Notoane. “We came from the Afcon where we qualified for the Olympics. We are hoping the winning spirit will rub off on this group. I’m sure they will come back victorious. “The most important message for the boys is to just encourage them to understand that it is important for them to go out there and win tournaments of this magnitude. This is the next generation of the Olympic team. Of course I’m here to watch the newly-formed team and I can see the future is bright.” Notoane added that he will not hesitate to pick some of the Amajita players for the Under-23 squad headed for the Olympics next year, should they raise their hand. “The door is never closed,” insisted Notoane. “If there is serious talent in this age group and an opportunity to bring them into the Olympic squad, then why not? There’s one or two that are very exciting and the future looks bright.”
