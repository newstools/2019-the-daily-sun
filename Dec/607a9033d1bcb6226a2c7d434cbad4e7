He tweeted: “Thank you to the Stellenbosch University for honoring me this morning with PhD-honoris causa - For my contribution to the Arts and service to humanity through my work as a writer, actor and playwright.” The Stellenbosch University's tweet read: “Welcome to acclaimed South African author, playwright, and actor, Bonisile John Kani, who will be receiving an honorary doctorate at #SUgrad this morning at 10:00.
