KAIZER Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp has confirmed that Daniel Akpeyi will start in goal against Bloemfontein Celtic as Itumeleng Khune is not yet ready. Khune completed his recovery from a groin injury. He has been training with the team, however, Middendorp has made it clear that Khune isn't quite fit to play. "I was really irritated and confused that no one is asking about Khune," Middendorp told reporters on Thursday. Daniel Akpeyi is expected to star when Amakhosi takes on Bloemfontein Celtic in a Absa Premiership encounter on Saturday night at Moses Mabhida Stadium (8:15pm). "As I said, he is not injured, he is in training now. "We have to make a decision about who now from a point of competitiveness is best prepared for this game we have on Saturday evening. "It is Daniel Akpeyi and it is he who will play. The second best prepared at the moment is Bruce Bvuma and he will be the second goalkeeper." Amakhosi will be hoping to maintain their 10-point lead at the top of the Absa Premiership standings.
