MANCHESTER CITY will head into their clash against Arsenal aware they no longer have room for error if they’re to defend their Premier League title. The Citizens make the trip to London for a battle with the struggling Gunners at the Emirates Stadium at 6.30pm today. Their hopes of clinching their third straight Premier League title are hanging by a thread after a few disappointing results, the latest being a 2-1 defeat to rivals Manchester United in the derby last week. The defeat afforded runaway leaders Liverpool breathing space at the top of the pile and resulted in Leicester City pulling away from the Citizens to become The Reds’ nearest chasers. Pep Guardiola’s Citizens were able to get back to their winning ways in the Uefa Champions League after defeating Dinamo Zagreb 4-1. They’ll be hoping for the same against Arsenal. Guardiola’s charges will be considered favourites against a struggling Arsenal outfit that has only won one of their last ten Premier League matches – their worst run in 42 years. The last time the sides met, Manchester City walked away 3-1 winners, with Sergio Aguero bagging a hat-trick. The Argentine won’t have the opportunity to repeat that feat, as he continues to be sidelined through injury. But in Brazilian youngster, Gabriel Jesus, who scored a hat-trick against Zagreb midweek, City have a capable replacement. Guardiola is pleased that Aguero’s absence hasn’t been felt as much as that of key defenders Aymeric Laporte and John Stones at the back, which is a credit to Jesus.
