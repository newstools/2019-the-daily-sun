Police divers and paramedics came to their rescue yesterday morning.  They saved the remaining three trapped boys who were in a tree. Initiation school teacher Bathini Tonisi (39) said they were lucky to be alive. “Everything was well until we witnessed the initiation school and our belongings being taken away by the water. The boys were frightened and I got injured on my leg while trying to save them. But I managed to rescue some of the initiates from drowning,” said Bathini.  He said he’d worked at the initiation school for more than 10 years but never had such a shocking experience. Thabo Komeke, a shepherd in the area said he was taking his goats to graze when he heard people scream. “I thought a fight broke out at the initiation school, but when I went closer, I saw three men holding tight onto the trees. They were screaming for help. “Their teacher had already called the paramedics for help,” said Thabo. READ: WATCH: FLOODS WREAK HAVOC IN MAMELODI!
