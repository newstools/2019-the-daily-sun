LIFE is good for King Monada as he is reaping the rewards of
hard work! The Limpopo’s finest said that his old friends are still his
friends and fame will never change him. According to Ska Bhora Moreki hit maker, nothing is good and
rewarding in music than to honour your gigs and respect the industry, including
fans, family and friends. He says a car faulty or tyre burst is the only thing that
can make him not to honour his gigs but other than that, nothing else will. The singer says he struggled a lot to break into the music
industry in 2005, and will not allow an opportunity to slip out his hand again. King Monada, real name Khutso Kgatle, said even though life
has changed for him, especially with his song Malwedhe that was released last
year, he will remain cool and humble. "The song gave me recognition and I have decided to release
another album next year, March." King Monada said he spent the whole of this year working on
his soon to be released album. He said the new album is similar to Malwedhe. "With all the popularity, I'm still the same man. “Fame and money has not changed me and will not change who I
am. "I'm still King Monada and my old friends are still my
friends," he said. His advised upcoming artists that they need to be patient
and that they should focus on their music. "I feel great, I have been struggling as it was
difficult to have a breakthrough," he said. King Monada says he will remain a cool and humble musician. Some of the songs he has released is Di Danunu in 2016, and
Good life in 2019.
