THE NFP’s warring factions are heading back to court. This is because the KZN provincial leadership has refused to recognise the re-election of Zanele Magwaza-Msibi as president. Magwaza-Msibi was re-elected on Friday at a conference in Ulundi that KZN legislature member Vikizitha Mlotshwa’s faction described as a waste of time. Provincial executive member Bonga Nzuza yesterday told Daily Sun his faction had asked its lawyers to start preparing court papers to challenge the conference. ­His faction decided against holding its own conference in QwaQwa, Free State, this weekend. Last week, Mlotshwa’s faction tried to block Friday’s conference but the court struck the matter off the roll, saying it wasn’t urgent. “The judge didn’t deal with the merit of the case,” said Nzuza. He said his faction stood a good chance to win the case, arguing the majority of the NEC was against the conference. No province had sent delegates, he said. Newly elected national secretary Canaan Mdletshe said a court ruling in May found the interim NEC was the only structure that could take the party to conference. At the conference, ex-Nongoma mayor Jeremiah Mavundla was elected deputy president, Bhekithemba Dlamini national chairman and Mzwakhe Sibisi his deputy. Kelly Baloyi was elected Mdletshe’s deputy and Phinda Sikhosana as treasurer.
