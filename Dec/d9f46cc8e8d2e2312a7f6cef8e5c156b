RUSTENBURG cop shop was voted the best station in the North West. It was awarded during the South African Police Service ninth annual Service Excellence Awards at Sun City last Thursday. During the award ceremony, officers in the province were honoured for their hard work. They were awarded on all levels and in various categories, which included Reservist and Community Policing Forum of the Year. Rustenburg station commander Nosipho Modise said the cop shop had worked hard. “We go out in the streets of our town as we can’t always be in the office. We’re out to ensure our people are safe. As a leader, you can’t direct all the time, but need to be hands on,” she said. “I encourage other stations to do the same. Go out and ensure better and safer communities.” Captain Patrick Murunwa was awarded the Detective of the Year. Provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane, said cops needed to be awarded for their dedication and be motivated to continue fighting crime. “These awards are one of the tools to show that our members receive proper recognition. “It’s befitting to honour these exceptional members because they form part of the South African Police Service’s machinery which keeps the province going,” said Motswenyane. North West Premier Job Mokgoro said police and the residents should work together. He called on cops to ensure communities were safe during the festive season. He also congratulated the winners and thanked everyone for their outstanding performance.
