“FLAME owes me an apology!” says fan Dennis Moloto (23), who was allegedly slapped by the rapper last weekend. Dennis told Daily Sun he was celebrating the end of exams at Da’side in Randfontein but ended up being served with a hot klap. “We were all having a good time and by the time Flame performed, most of the crowd had been drinking. People threw booze into the air. The music was stopped and he told us to stop,” said Dennis.  MAN WHO FILMED ANELE HOYANA ATTACK SPEAKS! Fritz Joubert and Anele Hoyana . Supplied photos. A man has said he filmed Fritz Joubert terrorising traditional healer Anele Hoyana on Joubert's instructions, but says he tried to stop him before Hoyana was bludgeoned to death, according to DispatchLIVE.  Dennis said that was when all hell broke loose and at that moment, Flame spotted him, pulled him up and gave him a klap. “I want him to apologise because such things drive one into depression. I didn’t get a chance to fight back as his friends and bouncers kicked me out before I even understood what was happening. “I didn’t deserve such humiliation. I won’t open a case and I don’t want him to pay. I just want him to apologise.” Dennis demanded Flame apologise on social media as he didn’t want to meet up. “He showed me he is a violent person. I don’t want to meet with him because he and his friends are dangerous.” Called for comment, Flame, whose real name is Lesego Mynandu said: “Go f**k yourself, mam, f**k you.”
