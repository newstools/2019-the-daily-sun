LIMPOPO’S Sekhukhune District Municipality has again been hit by fraud case after R12 million was deposited into a wrong account. It was found on Tuesday the money was meant to be paid into the compensation fund, but the account number given by the fund differed from the one the cash was deposited into. In July last year the municipality lost R5,4 million, which was also deposited into wrong accounts. Sekhukhune Mayor Stan Ramaila said they didn’t rule out the possibility the account holders and officials within the municipality might have planned the fraudulent activity. “We’ll engage with the provincial government to launch a forensic investigation that will dig deep into all the affairs of this municipality, not only investigating this one matter. “We want those responsible for this to be brought to book,” he said.  These were flagged by the Auditor-General during the 2018/2019 financial year audit. They were ordered to personally pay back R611 000. “The decision to hold municipal officials personally responsible for the fruitless and wasteful expenditure and to institute disciplinary measures was taken in recognition of the amended Public Audit Act. “It compels leaders of audits to implement consequence management to curb non-compliance,” said Ramaila. He said the council had already suspended municipal manager Nora Maseko for some issues raised.
