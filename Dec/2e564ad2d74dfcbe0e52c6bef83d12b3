ACTOR, artist and motivational speaker GP-MaOrange can finally celebrate! After 20 years as a kwaito singer, he’s been recognised at last. The 46-year-old from Alexandra in Joburg, whose real name is Israel Matseke-Zulu, won big at the Mzansi Kwaito and House Music Awards on Saturday. He was named the winner in the Best Music Video and Best Kwaito Single categories at the awards held at Carnival City in Ekurhuleni. An excited GP-MaOrange told Daily Sun the song that won him the best single award, King Fruit Manamune: Last Man Standing, was released last year.  On stage, he said: “Prayer and perseverance pays off, especially if you do what you love. We’ve been saying kwaito isn’t dead and this award proves that.” He thanked stars such as Mandoza, Mapaputsi and Sbu for inspiring him and not giving up on kwaito.  The track Fakalento, which bagged best video, was up against Cassper Nyovest’s Gets Getsa 2.0, Prince Kaybee’s Gugulethu, and Mzekezeke’s Nay Lento. “The video was shot and produced in Plumtree, Zimbabwe, by local producers and artists Tsibi and RS.”  GP-MaOrange paid tribute to Zimbabwean artists and producers who contributed to Fakalento, saying it proved there was no xenophobia in music. “Music transcends borders and Africans have been united by music for the longest time,” he said.  He said he planned to work with other African artists in the future. “It’s our responsibility as artists to unite,” he said. He also assured fans his acting career was not on hold, saying he had projects lined up for next year. “I can’t disclose much, but I’m busy shooting,” he said.
