The first leg of the concert started in Joburg. It featured artists such as Black Coffee, British musician Tom Misch, Distruction Boyz, Muzi Mazibuko, Samthing Soweto, Jazzi Disciples, AKA, Sjava and Moonchild. The same artists were expected to perform in Durban, but some of them did not. Distruction Boyz, Samthing Soweto and Muzi took to social media to apologise to fans for not being at the concert. Samthing Soweto wrote on Twitter: “I’m so sorry. The weather messed up all our plans.” Muzi said: “Bitterly disappointed at the outcome. Got cut from the line-up. Had a special set all planned.” Many people who attended the show took to social media to complain, saying they waited in the rain for their favourite artists, but they never performed.

In a statement, Black Coffee said: “It is really unfortunate that the weather did not permit us to bring the full Music Is King experience to Durban. “The safety of patrons was our highest priority and hence we had to wait for legal clearance before continuing with the show. We sincerely apologise to all our fans and the artists involved who were excited to perform on this stage. My team and I are currently working to bring back this experience as previously planned for my hometown Durban.”
