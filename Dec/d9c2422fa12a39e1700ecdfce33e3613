YET another week, yet another challenge for Mamelodi Sundowns. As many prepare to indulge in delicious Christmas feasts and spend time with family and friends, the Brazilians are in the north of the continent to Algiers for a Caf Champions League assignment. Fresh from their 1-0 league victory over Polokwane City on Saturday, Pitso Mosimane’s side go into their fourth Caf match in as many weeks when they tackle USM Alger in their Champions League group C fixture on Saturday (6pm, SA time). But it is nothing unusual for the Tshwane giants, who are used to having their travelling bags packed all the time. “We leave on Monday. We’ll try to have a Christmas with the boys in Algiers but we don’t know how we are going to do it,” said Mosimane. “We will probably have something with the embassy to entertain ourselves. But the boys know the challenge we face. Our schedule is very tight. We will be up for it. I know this team and what it can achieve.” Mosimane praised his charges for their gallant fight to register a narrow win against City at Loftus, courtesy of a late Sibusiso Vilakazi goal. But importantly for showing character and keep their Premiership campaign on track. “I’m happy they had the legs,” Mosimane added. “I thought they would not have the legs after the Wits game. “But they’ve got the heart also and the character. You saw against City. It’s all in the mind. It’s all in the character.” Sundowns are top of Group C with four points after two games. A win against unknown Alger will further enhance the Brazilians chances of reaching the knockout stage.
