Nolufefe Jojo, a 45-year-old woman from
Marikana Squatter camp in Cape Town, want people living with HIV/Aids to know
that it’s not the end of the world. She was diagnosed in 2002. “When I heard that I had the disease I
wanted to die but the thought of leaving my kids behind is what kept me
fighting", said Jojo. She also found out while she was
pregnant at the same time. “At first I was shocked because I had only one
partner. I was afraid what people would say about me because when a person gets
sick, everyone has something to say but my kids kept me going," she added. "On December 1, it is World Aids
day, meaning people living with this disease will get support but they also
need to accept the situation so that it becomes easy for other people to
support them," added Jojo. She went to say that knowing that the situation
won’t change is the first step in living a healthy lifestyle.  She added that eating healthy and staying away
from alcohol also helps and even those that are positive can still live longer
just like any other person. "We are still the same people that
we were before being infected, we don't have to spread the disease by sleeping
with our partners without condoms and the mentality of wanting to infect others
because just because we were also infected. It is wrong in so many ways",
she added. Jojo said World Aids Day allow people to unite
in the fight against HIV. "This day is to show support to
those living with HIV and I hope we get to support all the time not only this
day because some find it difficult to accept that they are infected,” added
Jojo. She went on saying that the ribbon that
most people wear in this day means a lot to them. "Knowing that people are
supporting you is another thing that keeps us going, some don't have families
and need all the help they can get,” added Jojo.
