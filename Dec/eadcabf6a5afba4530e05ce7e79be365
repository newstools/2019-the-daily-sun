President Cyril Ramaphosa has decided SAA must go into voluntary business rescue, according to a letter signed by presidency director-general Cassius Lubisi. The letter, dated December 4, says Cabinet initially adopted an approach that entailed restructuring. However, it adds, "developments have now necessitated a change of approach" to address the "dire situation" at SAA.Â "In this regard, SAA will have to urgently go into voluntary business rescue," it says. Speaking to Fin24 on Wednesday night, SAA spokesperson Tlali Tlali did not comment on the letter itself, but directed Fin24 to its authors. Fin24 has been told by a senior government source that a formal statement was going to be issued on Wednesday night.  https://www.fin24.com/Companies/Industrial/breaking-saa-must-go-into-business-rescue-ramaphosa-orders-20191204
