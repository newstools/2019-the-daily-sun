SANGOMAS were not happy after their muthi suppliers were bust! Four men were found with wild animal parts including buffalo heads and crocodile skin at Faraday Taxi Rank over the weekend. Sangoma Naledi “Mafavuke” Sibeko said animal skin played an important role in healing. She said white people killed animals for fun and made a sport out of it, but it was a problem when they used it for healing. “This kind of muthi is not easy to find and is very expensive. We know what to do with it and can’t just tell the public because they could use it for all the wrong reasons,” she said. Gobela Ntombi “Sbhamu” Mbatha said: “I won’t lie. The suppliers don’t tell us how they get the skins and animal parts. “We just know they don’t come cheap and we shouldn’t ask questions if we don’t want to be blacklisted.” Gcinile “Maliyavuza” Mkhize from the CRL Community Council explained that sangomas and muthi sellers knew it was illegal to have certain wild animal parts in their possession. “If it’s animals you’re able to live with daily, like cows and goats, it’s sometimes not a big deal,” said Maliyavuza. “ But we all know that it’s shocking to come across a buffalo or crocodile head under normal circumstances.” Police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters confirmed that four men were bust over the weekend and would appear in court soon. “Police, together with the Green Scorpions, arrested four suspects and seized animal skins. “We’re aware that almost everyone in that muthi market is in possession of different animal skins, but we were targeting owners and not employees. We respect their practice but won’t tolerate illegal trade.”
