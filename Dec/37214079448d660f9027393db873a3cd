Self-confessed AmaPiano music lover Samir Nurkovic is the now the PSL top scorer after his hat-trick demolition job on Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday night. Nurkovic had a sterling performance when Kaizer Chiefs walloped Bloemfontein Celtic 5-3 at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in what could be the best match of the season. Nurkovic is now on nine goals in 11 matches and his three stunning goals on Saturday night kept Amakhosi 10 points clear at the top of the PSL table. "We showed character even though it was difficult," Nurkovic told Supersport at the post match interview. "But we continued to show a fighting spirit. The coach said a lot of things in the dressing room at half time and we woke up - we won and we are happy. There are still a lot of games and we must stay focused. We have been training together for five months and we are getting better and better as a team." Nurkovic also paid tribute to Chiefs fans. "Our fans are the best in the world and I always feel good good when I play in front of them."
