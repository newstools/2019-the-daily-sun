AMAZULU coach Jozef Vukusic look set to beef-up his squad during the January transfer window period with the signing of Slovakian striker Milos Lacny. An insider at Usuthu told SunSport that Vukusic’s countryman arrived in South Africa two weeks ago and will help solve their scoring problem. The 31-year-old was playing for Slovakian side SKF Sered where he scored four goals in 12 appearances. He scored 17 goals in 56 appearances while playing for another Slovakian club MFK Ruzomberok from 2015 until 2017. AmaZulu have been struggling to find the back of net as they failed to score a single goal in their past four Absa Premiership matches. The last time Usuthu found the back of net was on 6 November when they beat rookies Stellenbosch 2-0 with striker Bongi Ntuli scoring a brace. But since then, goals seems to have dried up for the former Mamelodi Sundowns bulky striker, which forced Vukusic to seek help from his home country. Said the source: “Lacny started training with the club two weeks ago and impressed the technical staff with his sharpness and eye for goal. He knows how to score goals from tight angles and I think he is better than Kaizer Chiefs striker Samir Nurkovic.” According to the insider, Zimbabwean international and former Chiefs midfielder Ovidy Karuru will obtain South African citizenship to free up space as the club has already exhausted their foreign quota. Although Vukusic admitted that they are searching for an offensive player, he said they are searching locally for their saviour. “We have some positions that we need to improve on. We are looking for an offensive player and I have options that we are currently working on until we find the right player. We have five foreigners and we need a local player, maybe we will get someone on loan.”
