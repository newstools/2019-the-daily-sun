GENESIS Faith Mission Church is doing its part to keep kids safe this festive season. The church in Gugulethu, Cape Town, started a school holiday programme after realising that many kids got into trouble at this time of the year. Pastor Ntombekhaya Nyama-Plati said it was everyone’s responsibility to ensure kids were safe at all times. “We can’t let them waste their future by doing bad things.” She said besides getting involved in bad things, some of the kids ran the risk of being raped. “Most parents leave their kids alone at home when they go to work. That means no one is looking after them,” she said. The pastor said churches should be more involved in helping communities. “We can’t just preach the word of God while our kids are in danger. “We need to be more involved in making a difference,” she said. The camp, which caters for kids aged 10 and older, runs from 8am until 4pm,” she said. Parent Nomvuzo Gwili (42) said she loved what the church was doing. “Imagine if all churches could do what they’re doing. We wouldn’t have so many incidents in which girls go missing and end up being raped,” she said. Nomvuzo said bored kids ended up selling drugs. “Bad boys like to use kids during this time of the year because they they’ve nothing to do. That’s when they start taking advantage of them,” she said. Plans were already in place to extend the programme to Marikana and Nyanga kasis.
