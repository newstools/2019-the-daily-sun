 THE City of Tshwane has told residents of Hammanskraal not to use water from taps! Acting mayor Abel Tau said the water was safe for adults, not for children. He said while they were still dealing with the issue of water, the city was providing alternative water sources for the time being. “There was a conscious decision to say until such time that we’ve done enough work downstream, where the problems are, we should not pronounce that the water is safe for human consumption.” READ: NO REST FOR THE DEAD Tau said lobby group AfriForum conducted independent tests that found that the water was safe for human consumption. “We want to be responsible about it. “There’s a lot of work that needs to happen,” he said. The South African Human Rights Commission said the water in the area was unfit for consumption. It said some of the water determinants could cause chronic health conditions. The problem came to light after a resident laid a complaint in March last year at the commission about the quality of water in the area.
