who was born at midnight. Olerato Unathi Dolo was born at 12am at MUCPP clinic in
Phelindaba, Mangaung but when SunTeam arrived at the clinic, the happy mum,
Malefa Dolo had already went home. Free State health spokeswoman Bonny Sehularo said 33
babies had been born in the province. Sehularo told Daily Sun:"16 girls and seventeen boys
were delivered. Baby girl Olerato was born weighing 3200g and her mother was

Christmas day. "I'm so happy that God has answered my prayers. Skylo
is my fisrt child and I feel blessed," said Katelyn.
