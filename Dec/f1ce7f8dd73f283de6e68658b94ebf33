SOUTH African boxing talents have produced a thrilling performance to end 2019 boxing calendar on a high note. Nkosinathi Joyi and Thembani Mbangatha are hoping to carry similar acts to the New Year. The local boxing sensations were in action yesterday and laid a solid foundation for the New Year. Joyi, a seasoned campaigner who was stretched by a stubborn Filipino Joey Canoy to a 12 round unanimous points victory, reclaimed the International Boxing Organisation (IBO) mini flyweight world title. If things can go according to his plan, Joyi, the three-times world champion, would like to get title shot on one of the lucrative world titles. “Everything is on promoter’s hands (Ayanda Matiti), but I would like to challenge one of the major title next year, especially those belts I have not won like WBC, WBO and WBA. “I’m happy with how I performed against Canoy. It was not an easy fight, but I managed to pull through,” said Joyi. “As every body knows, I was preparing for Siphamadla Baleni and later I got this opportunity to challenge for the world title on a lighter division. “After this performance, I will definitely stay at mini flyweight as I want to win another world title at this weight class,” he said. Another fighter who is anticipating great 2020 is the Western Cape’s undefeated Mbangatha, who stopped Aphiwe Masangawana inside third round for a right to challenge a vacant SA featherweight belt. Mbangatha will face the fellow Capetonian Kinert, who has beaten a vastly experienced Mfusi Maxhayi. “New Year is promising to be a busy year for me. “I aim to win the national title and defend it a couple of times and move to international stage. “I am excited by the fact that the vacant featherweight crown will be contested by Western Cape boxers,” said Mbangatha.
