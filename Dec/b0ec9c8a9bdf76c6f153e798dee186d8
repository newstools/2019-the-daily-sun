NOBODY gave DA Gauteng Legislature leader Makashule Gana a chance when he threw his name in the hat to contest John Steenhuisen for the top position in the party. Predictably, Gana was beaten to the post. MAKASHULE WANTS TO REPLACE MMUSI! He sat down with us for the latest episode of Under the Umbrella to tell us why he entered the race, despite twice failing to win the Gauteng premier candidate race. He shares with us his thoughts about what kind of leader the DA needs, admits the party is facing a crisis, but still believes itâ€™s the only party that can lead the country. A former youth league leader, Gana said he would not follow former leader Mmusi Maimane, who recently hinted he could form a new political party. Gana said his blood would remain blue even though he admitted the party had to deal with its racial problems.
