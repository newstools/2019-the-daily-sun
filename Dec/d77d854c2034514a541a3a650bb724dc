Some parents have enough money to buy expensive Christmas gifts. But there are those who are unemployed and struggle to even buy groceries. It’s more difficult for poor parents during this time of the year because kids are overwhelmed by peer pressure and want expensive clothes. Even when parents tell them they don’t have enough money, kids don’t believe what they’re told. Let’s include kids in family discussions when we talk about income and expenditure. Such engagements will probably help kids see that parents are trying their best. Kids should know that it’s not their fault that parents are poor. They should focus on doing well in their studies and eventually follow their own careers. Those who get everything they want shouldn’t think they’ve made it. They owe it to themselves to pave their way to a brighter future. The festive season is a temporary thing. It’s important to prepare a better future for children. To achieve this, kids need to avoid drugs, booze and unprotected sex.
