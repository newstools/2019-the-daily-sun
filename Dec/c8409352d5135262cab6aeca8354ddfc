INTERIM SA Under-23 national team coach Helman “Midnight Express” Mkhalele and his newly assembled team are eager to impress at the U-20 Cosafa Championship. They head into this year’s edition of the tournament to be staged in Zambia from Wednesday to 14 December, as one of the favourites having won the last two chapters. That, though, was under former coach Thabo Senong, who has since been replaced by his then assistant, Mkhalele. The former Orlando Pirates star is eager to make his own mark with Amajita as he has set his sights on landing the role on a permanent basis. Mkhalele knows exactly what is expected from him if he is to grab the opportunity he has been handed, with both hands. “I didn’t get a specific mandate,” said Mkhalele. “But having been in the set-up for some time, I do know that when you lead this team, you are expected to get results. “It’s expected that we defend our title and that is what we are going to try and do.” Amajita, who have been drawn in Group B alongside Lesotho, Madagascar and Mauritius, will travel to Zambia tomorrow to continue their preparations. They will face Mauritius on Thursday before they lock horns with Madagascar on Sunday. Mkhalele’s boys will then face Lesotho on Tuesday, 10 December in their final group match.
