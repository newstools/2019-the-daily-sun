AFRO-POP singer Morena Sefatsa is making his way back to the small screen. The 30-year-old, who is popularly known as Morena: The Squire, told Sunday Sun he would be doing a new talent show for TV called Amazing Voices, alongside Buhle Mda and Vusi Nova. He said the show would be produced in many African countries. “The show is basically a talent search competition. We’re looking for people who can really sing, in groups of four, six and eight,” said Morena. “They’ll go head-to-head against other countries mainly Kenya, Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Top groups will represent Mzasi in pop, gospel and R&B.” He said the show would air on DStv channel Mzansi Magic next month. Morena also released new music this year, featuring Buhle on hishit-single Moya. “I really enjoy her voice. I think she’s a force to be reckoned with. I wrote the song with someone who was going to give it life in mind,” he said. He told the People’s Paper he is working on a new project that he’s planning to drop next year. “I’m releasing an album in April and am going to work with so many people on it. People should look forward to it as it’ll be so amazing.”
