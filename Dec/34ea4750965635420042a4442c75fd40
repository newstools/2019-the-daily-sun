Cape Town City midfielder Thabo Nodada’s stunning solo effort has been voted the Absa Premiership Goal of the Month for September/October. Nodada’s stunner came against Soweto giants Orlando Pirates in a thrilling 3-3 draw at the Orlando Stadium in September. The diminutive attacking midfielder picked the ball just off the halfway on the left flank, dribbled past two Pirates players before unleashing a scorching drive past Jori Delle. He was today awarded his award for his brilliance at the club training base in Cape Town. The 24-year-old has been in fine form for the Citizens since his much anticipated return from a long injury layoff. Nodada has scored three goals in his 10 league matches so far.
