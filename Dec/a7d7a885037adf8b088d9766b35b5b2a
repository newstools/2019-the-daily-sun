Mmoni Seapolela, spokeswoman for SABC said we havr learnt that there is a rumour and a campaign on Twitter that people must stop listening to Thobela FM because a particular song is removed from the list. "I would like to put it clear that the rumour is so untrue.That's why we decided to update on the station's Twitter page to clear the matter." She said. On Thobela FM's Twittet Page the station says the public feedback has been noted and the station wishes to reiterate that it will have a crossover song without listeners participation, as this is how the station planned it for this years. Early this year Thobela FM was under a serious criticism after the most loved song "Malwede" by King Monada couldn't make it as a crossover song beaten by Masyer KG's "Skeleton Move".
