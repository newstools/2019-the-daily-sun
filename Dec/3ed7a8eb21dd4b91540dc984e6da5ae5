 XITSONGA
rapper Sho Madojozi’s tweets didn’t sit well with some of her followers. This was after the rapper whose
real name is Maya Christinah Xichavo Wegerif shared that she has been waiting
at the airport for about 8 hours to fly to Port Elizabeth. Sho Madjozi has always been
praised for raising her voice against social issues affecting South Africans. She shocked her fans with her Twitter statement.  She said in her tweet: “Been waiting at the airport in Durban for about 8 hours
waiting to fly to PE. The flight is now schedule for 23h45. Hoping for the
best.” The John Cena hitmaker
from Limpopo was asked by one of her followers Aunty Zee on how this happened. The star responded and said that
it was because of the mass looting of state under the former president Jacob
Zuma. This made some of her followers angry as they thought
her response was misinformed especially with
the current issues that SAA is experiencing. Some
were even labelling her a tribalist.
