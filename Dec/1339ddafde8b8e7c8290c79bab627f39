An Ethiopian trader Samuel Dega Tadesse (29) was shot
dead by thugs at his shop. It is alleged the two were sleeping when the thugs hit
their shop in Rolle Village outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga
on Tuesday around 2am. His traumatised brother, Emanuel Adise Tadesse (25), told
the Sun Team that they were asleep inside the shop when they were woken up by
some noise of a heavy object hitting the wall. “We were sleeping
inside the shop when we heard some noise of a heavy object hitting against the
shop wall. We couldn’t believe our eyes seeing four criminals who pointed guns
at us while they threatened to blow our brains out if we resist meeting their
demands.. “As others continued hitting the wall with a giant
pillar, leaving a big hole on the shop wall, one of them started firing shots
at my brother Samuel.” He said a bullet hit him below the stomach before he
collapsed bleeding profusely on the floor.  “I saw him taking his last breath. So fast, they
ransacked the shop and took undisclosed amount of cash and valuable items
before they vanished into the thin air,” sobbed Tadesse while being comforted
by other fellow traders also mourning his brothers’ death. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the police
are investigating a case of robbery as well as murder. Anyone with information which could lead to the arrest of
the suspects can contact Mhala police on 013 7730 331.
