SHE’S devastated the house she shared with her boyfriend was burnt to ashes. But Bulelwa Dadela is grateful to be alive. The 29-year-old mum of a nine-month-old baby told Daily Sun a group of angry residents petrol-bombed her house in Tarlton, near Krugersdorp, on Thursday. She said a day before the attack, unknown men came to ask where her boyfriend was. “I told them he went out. I asked what they wanted but they left without answering me,” she said. Bulelwa said she knew her boyfriend was accused of murder but knew he had nothing to do with the incident. “I never thought the community would be heartless and burn our house while we were inside,” she said. “I was asleep with my baby when I was woken up by flames. I had to get myself and my baby out of the burning house. I have minor burns but my baby is okay.” She said after she went outside, the residents ran way. “They know that this has nothing to do with me. We almost died because of something we know nothing about,” said the mum. The father of the man accused of murder told Daily Sun at the time of the fire, his son had already gone to the police to flee the angry residents. “According to what my son told me, he was being attacked and he had to defend himself. He told me he was attacked by several men but when he left no one was dead. “I’m really disappointed. The people almost killed an innocent child and her mother because of their rage,” the father said. The People’s Paper spoke to residents but they all said they knew nothing. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Noxolo Kweza said a murder case and a case of public violence were being investigated and a suspect was in custody.
