Afro jazz group Urban Village wants to spark conversations about people’s daily struggles in their new single Sakhisizwe. The band that has its roots firmly in Soweto prides itself in creating music that challenges society to do things differently. Frontman Tubatsi Moloi said they are inspired by the history of African people during the the days of migrant labour. “The song is inspired by the sentiment to build a nation, and it's our observation of dialogues that need to include things like xenophobia,” he said. He added that they want to encourage basic communication about the daily struggles that people face. “These are things we also grew up seeing in Soweto, and part of creating music with meaning is talking about those things,” he said. Holding cards close to his chest, he said the debut album will be released early next year under a French recording label.
