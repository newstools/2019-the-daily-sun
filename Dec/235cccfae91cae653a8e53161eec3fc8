Zozibini Tunzi’s win as both Miss South Africa and Miss Universe is just what African women needed to believe in their own natural beauty again. When politicians and the media speak about South Africa being captured, I always look further than our state entities. I also watch helplessly when politicians and influential people keep mum about Africans being captured by the commercial world of fashion and beauty. The commercial industry is calling the shots in what the beauty trends should be. To prove this point, no trend comes for free. Only when you spend a lot on make-up, you’re seen as being beautiful. They make us believe expensive Brazilian or Peruvian weaves make us more beautiful. That’s an illusion that only makes us financial slaves and leave us with no true identity or confidence. Many of us have never been to South America, but ironically believe wearing the South Americans’ hair makes us beautiful. For Zozi to win Miss South Africa and Miss Universe sporting her natural hair, just goes to show she’s a beauty. Surely, many African women will start reviewing how they see beauty. It’s interesting to note that even Mzansi’s seasoned women celebrities were inspired by Zozi’s achievements and her attitude towards beauty. She has shown other women the way to free themselves from being slaves to commercial beauty. Ignore her statement at your own risk.
