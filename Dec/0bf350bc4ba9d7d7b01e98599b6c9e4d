FORMER eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede hasn’t attended council meetings since she was removed, and opposition parties are demanding action. This after Gumede missed another full council meeting in Durban yesterday. During the meeting, DA caucus leader Nicole Graham asked where the former mayor was. Graham asked speaker Weziwe Thusi to declare Gumede’s leave of absence as invalid because it had been three months of apologies. Thusi ignored the issue and put it to vote, but it was defeated and Gumede’s apology was accepted. DA chief whip Thabani Mthethwa also objected to the apologies of two ANC councillors Nomthandazo Shabalala and Nomusa Mthembu, who didn’t attend. Mthethwa said they were out on bail and sitting at home so their apologies shouldn’t be accepted. But this was also dismissed. Shabalala and Mthembu are among four councillors who were released on R5 000 bail on Wednesday. They are facing corruption charges relating to a R208 million waste tender. The DA said Gumede was last seen in September during the election of the new mayor and hasn’t attended any council or committee meetings since. “We are concerned the councillor hasn’t done any work for three months, but continues to draw a salary from taxpayers. We call on you speaker to take a decision against her,” said Graham. Gumede is out on R50 000 bail. She is facing corruption, fraud and money laundering charges. She was arrested earlier this year by the Hawks and is accused of playing a major role in awarding of companies that received the R208 million solid waste tender.
