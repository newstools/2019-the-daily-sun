CURRENT PSL joint-top goalscorer, Golden Arrows striker Knox Mutizwa, says he will remain competitive to clinch the end of the season golden boot award. The Zimbabwean striker says it is every player’s dream to win such a coveted gong in whatever league they play and he’s one of them, however, he’s not putting himself under pressure. Mutizwa is tied with Highlands Park’s Peter Shalulile on eight goals. “Every striker has a desire of becoming a top goal scorer,” Muitzwa told SunSport. “I’ll be happy if I can manage to achieve the golden shoe award.” The 26-year-old has already matched his last season tally of eight goals. He went on: “Even though I didn’t score too many goals last season, I was playing well. The coach (Steve Komphela) told me to continue where I left off and try and score for the team.” The last player from Arrows to win the PSL Golden Boot award was the late Richard Hanyekane in 2008-09 season. Mutizwa, though, says he is focused on helping his team finish as high as possible. Abafana Bes’Thende are currently fourth on the log with 20 points from 13 games. “We can’t always be a small team that only desires to finish in the top eight,” Mutizwa said. “This time we’ll try and fight for a top position.”
