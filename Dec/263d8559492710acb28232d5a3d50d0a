RESIDENTS of Browns Farm in Philippi were happy when the City of Cape Town finally unblocked a drain this week. Thuleka Ntongana (35), who lives close to the affected drain, said it was only fixed after Daily Sun ran a story about the problem. She told the SunTeam it took over two months for it to be fixed. “We had been reporting the drain for some time but nothing was done,” she said. “We couldn’t even smell what we were cooking but now it’s all in the past, thanks to the People’s Paper.” Thembakazi Thomas (39) said the drain was making residents sick. “We were forced to stay indoors and our kids were getting sick,” said Thembakazi. “The municipality should have fixed the problem a long time ago. “It’s difficult to believe the drain is finally fixed. It was bad. “There was kak all over the place. We will forever be grateful to Daily Sun.” Residents said they had started worrying they’d have a smelly Christmas. Another resident said: “We were worried about how we were going to enjoy the festive season, trapped in our rooms. Now we can cook meat and smell what we’re cooking.” Residents said they were happy with water and waste services mayoral committee member Xanthea Limberg for keeping the promise she made when she said a contractor would fix the problem. “When we saw her comments in the story, we weren’t sure it would happen, but she was telling the truth and we are grateful for that,” said the resident.
