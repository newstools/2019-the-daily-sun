DOZENS of protesters and their leaders have been arrested after state security workers used violent and excessive force to stop a pro-independence march in northern Angola. Protesters were arrested in the city of Cabinda, in the province of Cabinda, where they were demanding a referendum for autonomy from Angola. They believed they were being marginalised. Ahead of the march, there was a heavy deployment of security personnel armed with batons and guns. Deprose Muchena, regional director of Amnesty International, said the deployment and use of excessive force showed that authorities weren’t prepared to tolerate dissent. – CAJ NEWS With a population of over 800 000 people, the province accounts for most of the country’s oil output, the main driver of the economy of Angola. The activist said the use of unlawful and intimidating tactics to suppress a peaceful protest totally disregarded the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. “Those arrested must be immediately and unconditionally released,” Muchena demanded. Arão Bula Tempo, the human rights lawyer, is among those authorities are being targeted in the crackdown against proponents of autonomy. Armed police surrounded his house in the lead up to the march earlier this week.
