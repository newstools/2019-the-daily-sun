JUST a few weeks ago, pupils celebrated the end of their final-year exams by throwing “pens down” parties. Many were spotted in parks carrying bottles of alcohol. As a result, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has asked the Gauteng Liquor Board to raid and shut down shebeens and bottle stores close to schools. According to Lesufi, the department received a petition from residents of Cresslawn in Kempton Park alleging a shebeen operated next to a primary school. The Gauteng Liquor Act states that shebeens or bottle stores shouldn’t be within a 500m radius of a place of worship or school. Lesufi said shebeens that were there before the schools were built would be asked to move, while those built during the existence of schools would be shut down. “Such places remain a serious challenge. Kids get tempted to buy alcohol with lunch money. “On the other hand, owners of these outlets have no shame selling liquor to minors.” Parent Nomusa Sibeko (40) said: “We just need owners to behave like parents and chase kids away when they come to buy.” Another parent, Bongani Ndaba (28), said: “These kids get drunk and fight with one another as they’re too young to handle alcohol.”
