This also shows we have fans all over the continent,” she said. Virginia said they did not have a great year but they managed to pull through. “We came out as conquerors and we’ve grown from all the challenges we faced. “We’re still not ready to talk about things that happened in the Idols SA because that would open up old wounds. “For now we’d rather focus on our journey going forward,” she said.
