Mzansi is the best when it comes to turning disaster into humour. Eskom went from stage 4 to stage 6 on Monday, which frustrated
people of Mzansi but they decided to turn this situation into a laughing
matter. The power utility keeps updating its social media pages regarding
electricity updates. And the fact that it has been raining for days without any
glimpse of the sun, has frustrated Mzansi even more. Some are even questioning if they really wanted the former
president Jacob Zuma out or it was just peer pressure. This would be lot funnier if it wasn’t so sad. As a people we have learnt to find humour in tragedy, but make no mistake, #Eskom is sabotaging the hopes of 10 million unemployed South Africans. #Stage6 #Loadshedding pic.twitter.com/kfSBtEPoVm  Some are even dragging this Eskom issue to relationships,
saying stage 7,8 and 9 will come and take the remaining spark in your
relationship. It also seems like people’s jolly moods will be limited this
Dezember – as the hard hitting AmaPiano bass might cause Eskom blackouts. Remember the massive sales on black Friday? Yup, people even
regret buying sneakers instead of buying generators.  So y’all kicked Zuma out and now we at Stage 6. Made your bed, sleep in it. Again. You can NOT complain about #EskomBlackouts when you decided to tick the box next to "ANC" on that ballot paper. You simply have NO RIGHT to complain AT ALL. ANC voters continue to put their own country at risk by voting in the same clowns over and over. pic.twitter.com/L9kKAhD111 #EskomBlackouts#loadsheddingstage6I miss this guy... uBaba would have made a plan long time ago, maybe borrow 1 Trillion from Russia then we sort Eskom out, bese the Guptas go and pay that skoloto!!
