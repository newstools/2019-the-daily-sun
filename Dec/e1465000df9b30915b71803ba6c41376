THE family of 18-year-old Gomolemo Legae who was raped, stabbed and burnt alive believes the only suitable punishment for her killer would be the death penalty. Hundreds of Mahikeng residents and others, including the ANC Women’s League, attended the funeral service held yesterday in Seweding Village. Speaker after speaker spoke of how cruelly Gomolemo lost her life. 'MLUNGU WHO KILLED ANELE WAS NOT A FARMER' She was set alight after she was raped and stabbed 25 times while she returned home from a tavern. Sanco representative James Gadinabokao said our country must bring back the death penalty as is Botswana. “This is the only solution.” Immediately after Gomolemo’s body was placed into the hearse to go to the cemetery, most of the family rushed to the Mmabatho Magistrates Court where the 19-old- accused of killing her, was supposed to make his first appearance. 'ACTOR STOLE MY PHONE!' Family member Tsholofelo Mashetla cried uncontrollably after the accused took longer than expected to take the stand. She said the family had no choice but to bury Gomolemo yesterday because of the condition her body was in. “I didn’t get to see her coffin going down into her grave because I wanted to see this man who killed her. Now he is still not here.” The angry crowd demanded that the suspect appear. Magistrate Themba Shabangu postponed the case to 21 February after the accused said he was abandoning his bail application.
