Chelsea's FIFA transfer ban for breaking youth transfer rules has been reduced after their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) was successful.The outcome means that Blues manager Frank Lampard will be able to sign new players in the January transfer window.  Chelsea were given a two-window ban last season after failing to register young overseas players over a number of seasons but that has been cut to one following a successful appeal.
