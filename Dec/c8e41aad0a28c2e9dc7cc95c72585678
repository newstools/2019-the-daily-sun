FOUR-time African Footballer of the Year-winner, Samuel Eto’o, says it’s impossible for African players to win World Player of the Year. Eto’o, who came third in 2006, says the reason why it is impossible is because Africans are still not united and that they’re looked down upon. He also hit out at African journalists, who are part of the award panellists, saying they don’t vote for African players, unlike in Europe and South America. “The problem is that we’re black,” a forthright Eto’o said in Durban on Friday during the launch of Castle Lager Africa Fives where he’s an ambassador. “Journalists have the power to vote, but they don’t vote for the player of African decent. Lionel Messi, (who won this year’s award) is from South America and South American journalists voted for him. “You look at the case of Virgil Van Dijk, who was second in the votes, European journalists voted for him. African journalists didn’t vote for Sadio Mané and that’s the sad truth.” The only African footballer to win the World Player of the Year is former AC Milan and now Liberian president George Weah in 1995. Senegal captain and Liverpool star, Mané, was fourth on the vote which saw Barcelona star Messi win this year’s Ballon d’Or a few weeks ago. Despite Eto’o being revered as the most successful African footballer with three Uefa Champions League medals under his belt, he says he has no intentions to venture into coaching. “No, I want to enjoy my life and football. I want to enjoy travelling with my family and also to rest,” he said. Eto’o (38) retired in September after a spell playing for Qatar SC. Other major trophies he won include the Fifa Club World Cup, three Spanish La Liga and one Serie A title. Internationally with Cameroon, Eto’o claimed the Olympic Gold medal in 2002 and the Africa Cup of Nations in the same year. He’s the all-time leading goal-scorer in the Afcon with 18 goals to his name.
