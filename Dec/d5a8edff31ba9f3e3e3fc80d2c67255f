Judas Moseamedi, who recently broke the hearts of Kaizer Chiefs supporters, could be easily mistaken for being Nkunzi Mhlongo's brother because they look so much alike. Moseamedi, who plays for Maritzburg United in the PSL, made the news two weeks ago when he single-handedly knocked Amakhosi out of the Telkom Knockout cup with his well-taken two goals. Nkunzi is playing the role of the bad guy in Uzalo - he is a gangster, he steals, he robs and terrorizes everyone/everything to have his way. But he has won the hearts of many soapie followers in Mzansi with his fine and impressive acting. Maybe the superstars areÂ  brothers from another mother, who knows... Do you agree with SunSport's observation that Judas and Nkunzi may be long-lost siblings?
