Martha, from Thembalethu Village near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, said her son was found in the area but in a different section. “After people read my story they called and told me my son was at a house in another section. The gogo there told us my boy suddenly arrived and stayed at her house where they were having a traditional ceremony. “She said he didn’t want to leave and never said where he came from,” said Martha. “The gogo told us she reported the matter to the cops on Monday. “She kept him at her house, waiting for his parents to come fetch him.” Martha said she was happy her son was back in her arms, where he belonged.  “Since he went missing, I had sleepless nights. I was so worried he would go hungry. “I just prayed that we find him alive,” said Martha. The boy’s gogo, Anna Sikhosana, said she was happy her grandson was alive and healthy. “We were going crazy. We couldn’t even eat not knowing where he was. “We thank Daily Sun for helping us. We were very worried,” she said.
