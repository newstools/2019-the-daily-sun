Top of the table, nine points clear and on a run of eight Absa Premiership wins on the spin! Kaizer Chiefs are truly in a “blessed situation”, as Ernst Middendorp says. The league title-chasers are guaranteed to go into the festive break top of the log, possibly with 37 points from 14 matches. But as the popular saying goes, getting to the top is not so easy; staying there is more difficult. However, the Chiefs coach intends to make their stay at the summit permanent, and possibly finish what has been a fantastic season for success-starved Amakhosi positively, even if it means skipping the Christmas and New Year break. Amakhosi have been on a roll, but maintaining momentum is as important as picking up every league point home and away. “For me, there is no break. It’s only three days,” said Middendorp. “In the beginning of the season we drew up a programme for the games. We are aware of the challenge ahead. So we are not having a break. We will be training even on New Year’s Day. Why not? It is definitely not a break.” Christmas family lunches often leave players with bigger bellies and short stamina. And that would explain Middendorp’s concerns about the possible loss of fitness. “We will not have a handicap with players coming back unfit. You always have to have a cycle, starting the season. It’s about maintenance going into the next step. At the moment I’d say we are on track. We are having parameters in terms of our training process. The technical team plans and executes well if you have limited number of injuries… as long as you have your squad available for selection. “We are in a blessed situation currently. You can say it’s a good indication that a lot of good is being done.” Amakhosi wrap up their year with an away fixture against Maritzburg United, intent on revenge following the TKO Cup loss. But establishing a 12-point lead over nearest-rivals Mamelodi Sundowns appears more important.
