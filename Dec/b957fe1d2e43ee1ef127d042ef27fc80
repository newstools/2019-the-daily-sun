MARITZBURG United are fully aware that they are facing one of the best teams on the African continent in the form of Mamelodi Sundowns. The Team of Choice will lock horns with Masandawana in the TKO final at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow (6pm), looking to etch their name in this historic trophy in the PSL. The priority from the Pietermaritzburg-based side is to win individual battles, something they ensured when they shocked Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 in the semi-final of the Telkom Knockout. “What is important is the individual abilities of the players. If we are well prepared tactically, and work hard for one another, then we stand a good chance,” said Tinkler, who won this cup in 2016 with Cape Town City. Maritzburg will also have to ensure that they nullify the threat posed by Themba Zwane and Gaston Sirino. The Uruguayan star, who is this tournament’s top scorer with three goals, will be back after the completion of his two-match ban. For United to beat Sundowns, there are key points that they’ll need to get right. One of them is to ensure that they keep a close eye on the nippy but troublesome Uruguayan. Maritzburg prefer to press their opponents high up the pitch. It was the case when they stunned Amakhosi on that fateful Sunday in Mbombela. Their hero on the day Judas Moseamedi, who scored two goals, will surely bring his scoring boots tomorrow and will be hungry for more goals in order to chase for the top scorer’s record. Three years ago, Moseamedi scored the winner in Polokwane, to hand Tinkler his first ever trophy as a coach when the Citizens beat SuperSport United 2-1.
