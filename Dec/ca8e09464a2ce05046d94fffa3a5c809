A FATHER who allegedly killed his daughter appeared in the Moretele Magistrates Court in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, yesterday. But his application for bail was postponed to 17 January as he didn’t have legal representation. READ: PABALLO'S LOVER: MY WIFE DIDN'T KILL HER! Onkgopotse’s mum, Mmabotse Moshole (36), said she wasn’t happy to see her husband in court. She said he didn’t look remorseful. “He saw me and looked like he was proud of what he did,” she said. Mmabotse said her husband used to be a good man. “He was a humble man when he was working. The problem started when he lost his job. “He changed into a wild animal,” she said. Mmabotse relived the day of the tragedy. She said her husband took Onkgopotse (12) by force shortly after she attended her niece’s graduation ceremony. And he never brought her back. “We looked everywhere for him. When we went to his dad’s house they said he wasn’t capable of hurting his own child. But later I was called to my father-in-law’s house. “When we got there I was told my daughter was lying in a pool of blood,” she said. READ: RAGE OVER KFC WEDDING!
