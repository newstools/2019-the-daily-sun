One cannot believe that I, like many other former initiates, donâ€™t like visiting those schools anymore simply because this tradition has lost its value. The government played its part to try and curb many incidents and casualties. The problem is that a lot of these new, underage initiates still lack respect for adults. They keep taking other boys by force from their homes to the mountains. During our days, even our songs were not mixed with vulgar words like they are today. If you want to be respected, you must respect yourself first. Letter by Samuel Radebe, in Heilbron
