Sylvia said if she had not been woken up by her neighbours screaming, she would be dead today. “I had a very long day and when I finally went to sleep, it was like I blacked out,” she said. She told Daily Sun when she first heard the screaming, she thought it was a dream. “I woke up and there were flames around me,” she said. Sylvia managed to escape but couldn’t save any of her belongings. Luckily, her two kids were not home. “I keep wondering what would’ve happened if they were here. Now I have to stress about starting over,” she said. Sylvia said she got along with everyone in the area and didn’t know who might have wanted her to die in a fire.

A neighbour told Daily Sun: “I have no idea what started the flames but I’m just glad she heard us when we screamed.”
