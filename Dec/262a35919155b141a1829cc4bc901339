FORMER Black Leopards coach Dylan Kerr has joined Baroka FC. This follows Wedson Nyirenda’s resignation last week. Kerr is expected to arrive in Mzansi next week to join his new team. An insider at the club told SunSport: “Our new coach is Dylan Kerr. “He has not arrived in the country yet. He will join the team next week and start preparing for the first match of the second round. ”Kerr will be returning to Mzansi for a second spell after impressing while coaching Leopards last season. He helped Lidoda Duvha survive relegation last term and he has been identified as the right man to save Baroka from possible relegation, following a terrible run of results so far under under Nyirenda. Baroka are occupying the 14th spot in the Absa Premiership table with 14 points after 15 matches. They are just a point away from the drop zone, which is currently occupied by fellow Limpopo side Polokwane City. Kerr will be hoping to make a winning start to his tenure in the new year when he guides Bakgaga against fellow strugglers, Cape Town City, on January 5.
