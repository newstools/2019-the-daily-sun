Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has made it clear that he does not think the Absa Premiership leaders need reinforcements in January. The Glamour Boys enjoy a seven-point lead over defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns at the top of the domestic standings and Middendorp doesn't feel there's a need to bring in new players. "We have a seven-point lead (at the top of the PSL table)," Middendorp told the media. "We have a team that has done well in these five-and-a-half months or six months of the season. They have done a fantastic job and why should we now be targeting changes? "Some players didn't perform as we were expecting as we have seen it in the season and the next point is, let's be honest, where are the players? â€œHere in Maritzburg on the Ayrshire street or on William Nicol streets? Where are the players really? "Let's be honest, we've done some planning, and everybody has organised themselves and put a team together. There's no need to run around." Middendorp's charges drew their final Absa Premiership clash of 2019 against Maritzburg United 1-1 and will get the New Year up and running at SuperSport United on Saturday, January 4.
