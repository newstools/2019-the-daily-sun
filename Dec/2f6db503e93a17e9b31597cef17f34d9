WHILE many churches prepare for the 2020 crossover today, a church in Ekurhuleni has to find ways to fix its collapsed roof. Pastor Melody Maseko of Eagles Dominion Prayer Mountain Ministries in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, said the devil had been attacking the church since it was started more than five years ago. “The situation has been stressing me a lot. I will keep praying hard for the spirit of Satan to be destroyed,” she said. She told Daily Sun thugs broke into the church every year. She said the roof collapsed during heavy rain earlier this month while she was trying to come up with a plan to prevent the theft. “Members of the church are now worshipping elsewhere and I don’t have funds to fix the damage,” she said. Maseko said the church helped the community. “We had a soup kitchen for the needy every week. This was made possible through donations received from a local organisation.  “The church was also used for community meetings and funeral services. But nyaope addicts have been targeting the church by stealing the sound system every time we replaced it,” said Maseko. She said they gained access through the windows even though there were burglar bars. Maseko said the last break-in was in September and R30 000 worth of equipment, which included speakers, cables, mixers, an overhead projector as well as microphones, was stolen. Resident Joseph Mabale said: “Nyaope addicts are a big problem in our area. They break into our homes. They don’t even respect a place of worship.”
