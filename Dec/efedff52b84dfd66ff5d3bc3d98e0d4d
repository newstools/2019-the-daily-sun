GOING sideways in German cars always manages to make kasi people happy. Be it in a BMW e30 spinning and doing doughnuts, an F80 M3 or the great sound of an AMG 63 AMG - people just love seeing cars go sideways. In this video, a blue BMW M3 can be seen spinning around a grey C63 AMG, and the crowd can be heard going crazy in the background.
