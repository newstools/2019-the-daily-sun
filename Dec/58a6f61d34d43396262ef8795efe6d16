NO ONE gave them a chance last season. This season, even as the defending champions, GladAfrica Championship TS Galaxy are still considered underdogs in the Nedbank Cup. Nevertheless, they will look to repeat the feat and defend the title they won against all odds – beating Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs in the final. They host Cape Umoya United today (3pm) in front of their supporters at the Kameelrivier Stadium, KwaNdebele for a place in the last-32 of the tournament. The Rockets’ captain, Ludwe Mpakumpaku, admitted that it will be difficult to defend their title, but they will do everything in their power to repeat last season’s heroics. “What we did last season was really special, not only for the club but for our community. “We’ve done what has never been done by most teams. We paraded the trophy in the most rural areas. “We went all over Mpumalanga giving the community first-hand experience. “We gave them hope that it doesn’t matter where you come from. When you have a goal you can achieve anything. “The experience of playing in the Caf Confederations Cup was wonderful, we’d love to go back there. “This Cup is a great opportunity for us to be able to test ourselves on the continent once more.” Meanwhile, in today’s other Ke Yona Cup qualification match, Uthongathi travel to Limpopo for a meeting with Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila at the Thohoyandou Stadium. The Cane Cutters, as Uthongathi are also known, are arguably the best team in the Championship at the moment and will be eager to transfer that form to the cup competition. But in TTM, they face one of only four teams they have not been able to beat so far this season with the sides playing out to a 1-1 draw the last time they met in the league.
