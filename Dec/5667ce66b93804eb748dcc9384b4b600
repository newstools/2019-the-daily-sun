THE festive season is a time for giving and being with family and friends! But it was not the same for the flood victims of Eeste Fabrieke squatter camp. They spent the festive season in the Mamelodi Baptist Church in Mamelodi West, Tshwane, after their homes were destroyed by floods two weeks ago. But one of the Miss Bachelorette 2020 finalists, Lebogang Mamphekgo (28) from B1 in Mamelodi West, made sure the kids were able to smile again. She spent time with them and also donated toys. “I was happy to leave the children with a smile. This is one of our priorities as Miss Bachelorette finalists. I love children and there was no way I could celebrate Christmas while they suffered and were lonely.” Rebaone Tshilo (10) was happy after she received a skipping rope. “I will play with my friends. May God bless Lebogang for giving us toys,” he said. Flood victim Shamaine Mbhedhle (24) said living in the church was challenging, but she was happy to see the children receive gifts. “I miss my shack and would have loved to celebrate Christmas with my family in Tzaneen, Limpopo,” she said. Khabonina Mokoena (29), founder of the Generous Simpliton organisation, said she joined hands with Lebogang to help the affected children. “This is difficult for the children as they had to spend Christmas in a church after their homes were destroyed by floods,” she said.
