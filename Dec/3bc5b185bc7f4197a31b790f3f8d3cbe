Singer Kelly Khumalo finds herself conflicted. The Asine hitmaker shared an emotional video on Instagram. She shared her thoughts about venturing into gospel music and also shared possible fears of losing herself and surrendering to a greater power. Trace recently launched a  gospel channel that Kelly Khumalo performed at. READ: CHAUKE TOLD TO STOP PERFORMING! The star said while she was driving home after performing that night, something changed in her. She said she used to think secular music was her calling until something hit her. She said she never imagined herself creating a gospel album, and the thought of it scares her. “It scares me so much because for me – I love God, I respect God, and I think the biggest fear comes from whether I am making the right decision," she shared on an Instagram story. An emotional Kelly wondered if she was capable or whether it was the right time, which are questions she doesn't have answers to yet. A teary Kelly said she trusts God but is scared she'll be surrendering and leaving herself behind. Kelly said she likes being in control of everything in her life but gospel is one thing she won't be in charge of. “I do not want to look back and think: Kelly, what the hell were you thinking?" she said. Kelly has been getting some positive feedback from fans who reckon she'll be just as great doing gospel music as she is Afro soul.
