YOUNG? What is too young?At age 32 Rhulani Mokwena is the youngest coach in the PSL. But he is set to return to his previous role as assistant to Orlando Orlando Pirates coach Josef Zinnbauer. This has followed the team's inconsistent run of results since he replaced erstwhile Milutin "Micho" Sredojevic in August. However, Mokwena's master, Pitso Mosimane, feels his protege was equal to the sizable task of steering the big Bucs vessel, despite his relatively young age. And he has back him to return to the head coaching position soon and do "better than me". "What is too young? One is never too young. It's about the balance. It's about the team accepting you, the players playing for you. It's also about the experience and little bit of luck. "But I'm glad he fulfilled hid dream of coaching Orlando Pirates. He wanted to fly and I said to him 'fly my boy, go for it'. "I was 33 when I swam with the Sharks, the Gordon Igesunds and the Clive Barkers. You can name them all." Mosimane doesn't see Mokwena's demotion to the second-in-command position as a step back in his career. He has backed him to return to a head-coach position. "It's not the end for him. He still has space in local football, " Mosimane said. "There are coaches who have been here for a very long time and they have won only one trophy. "He must come back. I mean he didn't even finish a season" "I was a coach at SuperSport United for seven years in the PSL and I left to become an assistant for five years at Bafana Bafana, " he explained. "There is nothing wrong if he is an assistant again, and these are words of encouragement from me to him." "When you are hands-on and working in the background, you learn and you improve.Â "I said it before that he's going to get better than me and i still believe that."
