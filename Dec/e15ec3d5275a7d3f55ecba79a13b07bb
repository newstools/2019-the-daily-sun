A TWO-YEAR-OLD baby girl was stolen from her mum’s bed raped and left outside the house on Saturday. She’s now fighting for her life at Maphutha Malatji Hospital in Namakgale, Limpopo. The baby and her twin sister were asleep with their mum when an unknown man allegedly broke the window of their RDP in Lulekani Village, Phalaborwa.  The 44-year-old mum was woken by the baby’s cries. Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: “She opened the door and found her child standing outside the room.  Mojapelo said the mother told the police she ran to her neighbour to call for help. “The baby was rushed to hospital for a medical check-up, and we hope she will get better soon,” said Mojapelo.  “We ‘ve opened a case of rape, which is being investigated by the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit. “The unknown suspect is at large. Investigators are hard at work and the suspect will be bust.”
