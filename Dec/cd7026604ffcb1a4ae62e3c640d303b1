THE ANC is united. This was according to secretary-general Ace Magashule yesterday during his report on the outcome of the party’s NEC meeting on Monday and Tuesday. Magashule said NEC members congratulated the president for his decisive action regarding SAA. “We have confidence in the president. We’re one. “He was elected, just like all of us, to lead. “We took a decision that no leader of the ANC must attack another. “It’s not true the president will be ousted come the national general council next year.” He said the intervention to save SAA through the business rescue plan was a collective decision. He emphasised President Cyril Ramaphosa would be supported in every way. He said those who were trying to drive a wedge between them were portraying Ramaphosa as though he was isolated from the rest of the top six. He said some political parties were falling apart today because the ANC was united and working together. He said some of the failures in SOEs and other government departments were unfortunately blamed on ministers when sometimes the real culprits were the administrators. Dakota Legoete, who shared the podium with Magashule, said: “No one is above our conference resolutions. “For instance, on Eskom we have asked our deployees to act fast so there’s certainty. What is happening (with load shedding) is negative for our economy.” He said it was painful for for people, especially breadwinners, to lose jobs because of the crisis.
