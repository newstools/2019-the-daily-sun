THE thugs made them lie on the ground, when they rose it was raining cash. This happened on Wednesday in the afternoon at Eersterust Shopping Center in Eersterust east of Tshwane where thugs bombed two ATMs. The thugs first started by tying two security guards who were guarding at the shopping centre with shoe laces and belts before approaching the ATMs.  Once they were there, they made everyone lie on the ground while they bombed the ATMs. After the explosion, the heavily armed thugs made off with cash while shoppers who were not on the ground ran for cover in stores and under stall tables. Those who were lying face down, were woken up by screams of people running after money.  Police spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo, said no one was injured during the robbery. He said police are looking for the suspects and a case of armed robbery has been opened.
