Kanthan Pillay, who kicked out journalist Samkele Maseko from eNCA 'like a dog', has now himself been kicked out. The channel announced that it has parted company with the director of news with immediate effect. eNCA JOURNOS' MEMO TO THEIR BOSS! “This follows outrage and condemnation after a tweet he posted” eNCA said the tweet does not represent the views of e-Media Investments and the channel. NEWS ANCHOR "KICKED OUT OF ENCA BUILDING LIKE A DOG" Pillay had posted on his tweeter that "Rats are swimming towards a sinking ship" in reference to Maseko leaving eNCA to join a rival channel. He also denied Maseko to serve his notice at the channel. Twitter is celebrating the axing of Pillay. Attention! Attention!
