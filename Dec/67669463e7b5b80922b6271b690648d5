SOWETO UJ Campus is painted red as scores of EFF members flocked to the campus for registration ahead of their party's National People Assembly. They were in high spirits. They sang and danced outside the registration venue while in the queue. The People's Assembly will be held at Nasrec Expo Centre in Joburg from today (Friday) until Monday.  Delegates came from all corners of Mzansi, some especially those from far, travelled over night to be part of this highly anticipated people's assembly. At the venue a few of the fighters were reluctant to say who their ideal top six leaders of the party would be, but they made it clear that after this people's assembly the current CIC Julius Malema, would be the leader of their red berets.  One of the Delegates from Gauteng told Daily Sun that they hope to see Mbuyiseni Ndlozi in the top six. "We think he might be of value in the leadership since he is a Doctor. He can be more than just a party spokesperson." He said they also have EFF Gauteng Chairperson Mandisa Mashego in their potential candidates for a top six positions.
