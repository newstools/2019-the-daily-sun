HUNDREDS of squatter camp residents were left stranded after fire destroyed everything they had. Among the belongings they lost were Christmas clothes and stokvel groceries. Linda Bavuma (37) from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, told Daily Sun it was about 2am on Monday morning when she heard people screaming. “At first it sounded as if people were being robbed, but then I heard someone screaming that there was a fire and I ran outside,” said Linda. “Other people will be celebrating the holidays in new clothes. For us it will be a different story. We have nothing.” She said residents were in the dark about what could have caused the fire.  “The person in the shack where the fire allegedly started died,” said Linda Aliziwe Dikani (35) said the stokvel groceries they received last week had all gone up in smoke. “Where are we going to get money to replace the groceries? How are we going to enjoy the festive season without food and clothes. We don’t even have a place to stay,” said Aliziwe.  Nkululeko Tshandu (46) said many squatters had already left for the holidays in the Eastern Cape and didn’t know their houses had burnt down. “When they come back they will need to rebuild their homes. We tried to control the fire but we failed. We have to start from scratch. Our festive season is over because we have lost everything,” said Nkululeko.  Fire and Rescue Services’ Jemarnie Carelse said many structures were destroyed. “A firefighter sustained injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital,” he said. Captain Frederick van Wyk said an inquest docket would be opened after a person died in the fire.
