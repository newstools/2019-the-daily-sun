With just over 46 years’ worth of legacy behind it, Avroy Shlain has launched it’s first ever Pop Up Shop at Greenstone Mall on the 22nd November 2019. This exciting leap forward comes with great financial empowerment opportunities and iconic products. Avroy Shlain is, and will always be a brand whose primary purpose is women empowerment. The cosmetic giant prides itself with the contribution made towards the upliftment of families and women nationally, and this Pop Up Shop is no different. The Avroy Shlain Pop Up Shop is maned by existing Group Managers and Area Distributors, this ensures that sales made go into the pockets of the sales force.  The Pop Up Shop was formally launched by Brand and Digital Manager, Mandla Mkhwebane, and Regional Sales Manager, Ayesha Kibi on the 22nd November 2019 by cutting a big red ribbon. Boasting leading favourites such as the legendary JS fragrance and en vogue Coppelia LED light lipgloss, recruitment tables, a funky photo booth, glamourous Hollywood make-up stands where customers can get a makeover, this Pop Up Shop is simply the gift that keeps on giving.  We had the absolute honour of being graced by the presence of Brand Ambassador, Zola Nombona, on Saturday 30th November 2019. The actress did a walk-through of the Pop Up Shop while exploring each category, she played around with the dynamic Coppelia Colour Impact lipsticks and took pictures with star struck fans and took a seat in one of the make-up sets.  “We are bringing Avroy Shlain to the people. We are at a shopping mall for the first time ever. People can see what the brand is about, what awesome products we have, and they can experience our products themselves”, said Mandla, the Brand and Digital Manager for Avroy Shlain. The Pop Up Shop will be open until the 23rd December 2019, it is at the @Home Court at Greenstone Mall.
