CHIPPA United are on the verge of signing striker Zakhele Lepasa on loan from Orlando Pirates. The 22 year-old will replace the duo of Lerato Manzini and Rhulani Manzini, who were shown the door last week as they were not in coach Norman Mapeza’s plans. Mapeza has had limited options up front with Augustine Kwem as his only available option. Having the reliable Andile Mbenyane going through rehabilitation after he sustained injury, Mapeza had no choice but to plead with boss Ziviwe Mpengesi to sign Lepasa. However, Lepasa has struggled to break into Pirates’ starting line-up under the guidance of demoted caretaker coach Rhulani Mokwena. He played only 18 minutes this season, coming on as a substitute against the Chilli Boys on 14 September. According to an insider at Chippa, negotiations between Bucs chairman Irvin Khoza and Mpengesi are at an advanced stage. Said the source: “The management have been looking around for a quick solution following the release of Lerato and Rhulani. The deal to bring Lepasa down to Port Elizabeth is expected to be sealed between the two chairmen before the end of this week. Although, Lepasa lacks game time, the coach knows what to do in order to speed up his process to be on par with other the players.” Lepasa made an impact while playing for GladAfrica Championship side TS Galaxy. He scored the vital goal to help them beat Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in the Nedbank Cup final in Durban last season to lift the trophy. His heroics that broke the hearts of Amakhosi fans made Pirates technical staff to take notice and ask management to recall him. But his talent was wasted on the sidelines since he continued to warm the bench instead of doing what he does best, scoring goals. His move to Chippa could help him regain his scoring appetite and open doors for his career to grow.
