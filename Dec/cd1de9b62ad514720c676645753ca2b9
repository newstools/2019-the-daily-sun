THE community of Lower Crossroads is reeling in shock. This after the younger brother of EFF ward 35 chairman, Mfundo Hermanus (45), was gunned down on Christmas Eve. Sabelo Hermanus (33) was driving with a friend when a bakkie blocked their way and its occupants shot at the car they were travelling in. The incident happened a few metres from Sabelo’s home in Philippi East. The friend, who was driving, survived with no injuries and fled from the scene. Mfundo believed his brother was being targeted. “They shot him in the chest and head. It’s clear they wanted him dead. “It was not just a killing. It was a hit,” said Mfundo. He said the family didn’t know who could be behind the killing. He said his brother was not in politics. A resident said the incident happened near her house. “I was in my yard when I saw the bakkie block the way for the victims’ car. “Two men from the bakkie opened the doors of the car and shot at him,” said the resident. Police spokesman Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident. “On 24 December at about 11.30am, a 33-year-old man was shot and killed in Nondlwane Street in Philippi East by unknown suspects who are yet to be arrested,” said Traut.
