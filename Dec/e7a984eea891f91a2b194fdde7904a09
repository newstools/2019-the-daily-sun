Speaking at a media briefing in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, yesterday, first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila said one province had raised the issue of turning it into an electoral congress, but the majority shot down the idea. “The previous congress agreed one of the secretariats would be full-time. Myself and comrade Chris Matlako are full-time,” he said. Nzimande said the congress would focus on key national issues, including the terrible economic situation. “The congress will offer solutions. The situation has got worse with state-owned entities and this is going to be discussed as well,” he said. One of the documents to be tabled at the congress said it’s not clear who the finance ministry is being influenced by when writing papers.
