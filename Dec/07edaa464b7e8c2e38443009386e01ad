ANATHI Kana, the founder of the Likuwe Ithemba Youth Foundation, is touched when he sees a family going without food. It was for this reason that the Good Samaritan from Marikana in Cape Town donated food parcels to five families recently. “When I heard about the families going to bed on empty stomachs, I had to do something because I know the feeling of not having food. Everyone deserves to be happy during this time. I know it’s not much but it will make a difference, even if it’s for a few days. The truth is that they need help throughout the year. We could only help five families. We’re trying to make a difference wherever we can,” he said. Anathi urged businesspeople to help poor families. Alfred Fanele (66) said he was grateful for the donations. “To someone who has everything, this might look small. We’re happy because we were stressed and didn’t have anything to eat,” he said. Nompumelelo Landu (42) said when she first heard the organisation wanted to help her family, she didn’t believe it. “We’re grateful to them for thinking of us in this difficult time,” she said.
