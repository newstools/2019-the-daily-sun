A MUM was devastated when her mentally ill son was raped. And cops allegedly refused to open a case. The 27-year-old mum from KwaMashu J section, north of Durban, said her son had already started receiving counselling. She said her son used to go to a normal school, where he was in grade 4. But the KZN Department of Social Development was arranging for him to enrol at a school more suitable for him. “I take my son to the KwaMashu Clinic every Wednesday and Thursday for counselling. His behaviour is different since he started counselling,” she said. “I think I’ll soon find out when he was raped as he hasn’t revealed all the information.” Her son has said he was sodomised by a boy who’s the same age as him. She thanked Daily Sun for contacting the department. KZN social development spokesman Mhlaba Memela confirmed social workers were assisting the family. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the mother should go to KwaMashu Police Station so that she could be advised more about the case as the suspect is also mentally ill.
