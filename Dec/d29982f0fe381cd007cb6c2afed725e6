A Duck named Dave has to have 4-5 removed after poking so much that he hurt his 4-5. Duck's owner, Josh Watson says Duck was mating with its female companions, Dora, Edith and Freda up to 10 times a day and got an injury that got him an awful infection that left him with no choice but to amputate. Duck was prescribed antibiotics and his owner was tasked with washing his penis daily, but as the duck kept trying to have sex and unfortunately the Vets decided the only thing they could do to make Dave more comfortable was to remove his 4-5.  "He tries to mate with his female companions a lot. Every chance he can get. Between five and ten times a day, maybe more." his owner to told Mirror. "He doesn’t stop throughout the year. Over winter he’s meant to calm down. The ducks stop laying eggs but he doesn’t stop mating. He just carries on."I think his female companions do like him. They obviously sometimes get fed up with him and wander off" he added.
