COMMUNITY health workers want to be reinstated in the jobs they lost three years ago. They gathered at the health department offices in Tshwane yesterday. Matlhodi Selahle (34) said some members had been working as volunteers for more than 10 years. Said Matlhodi: “We had hoped to get permanent jobs.” According to Matlhodi, it was agreed with the department in 2012 that 9 000 volunteers would be employed full time. Matlhodi said the department appointed an NGO to oversee the volunteers in 2016. “We didn’t want to work under an NGO as they struggled to pay us on time,” she said. She said the NGO’s contract ended in May last year. “Many of us were left without work while others were given contracts by the department. “We want our jobs back,” said Matlhodi. Another volunteer, Maropeng Sachane (49), said the department used ghost workers. He said it’s sad the department told them they would not accommodate all the workers at the same time. “The department promised that by 7 December last year all workers would be re-employed. We’re tired of empty promises,” said Maropeng. Maropeng told Daily Sun almost 300 volunteers were still unemployed. Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana said talk that the department was not hiring was not true. Kekana said: “A meeting with representatives was held on 25 November to inform them about the department’s plans.” The plans included appointing community health workers permanently in the new financial year.
