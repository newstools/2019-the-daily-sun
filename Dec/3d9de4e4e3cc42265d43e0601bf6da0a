The Proteas’ major sponsor, Standard Bank, have voiced their concern about the development of Cricket South Africa (CSA). This after the recent governance and conduct media reports which have brought the name of cricket into disrepute. Standard Bank have scheduled a meeting with CSA to discuss these concerns. Their Group Chief Marketing Officer, Thulani Sibeko, said cricket in South Africa is a national asset and should be nurtured to thrive. “In recognition of the widespread interest in and support for cricket, we value the right of South Africans and the broader cricket community to know about developments within CSA, especially those that relate to governance and conduct,” said Sibeko. “Standard Bank is hopeful that we will emerge from the meeting with CSA assured that our concerns, and those of other stakeholders, will be addressed speedily.”
