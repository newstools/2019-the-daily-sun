mandate of the panel was to give an independent appraisal of governments land
reform process looking at the policy and legislative frameworks and
institutional arrangements. "The Panel
had to reflect on the Parliamentary Constitutional Review Process on
expropriation of land without compensation." She said the brief
also extended to issues of agricultural development and spatial planning. "The Panel
also looked on how the institutional framework in all government operational
matters including transparent nature on land allocation and disposal." Didiza added that
the attention was also given on the funding of land reform and proposals on how
this important mandate can also leverage on private individuals who are willing
to donate land to the state for land reform purposes. "The panel
also proposes some interventions that can induce more land release." she
said The panel wants to
establish or delegate central authority with clear powers and responsibilities
to proactively manage state land and ensure that such an authority meet its
broad obligations and balance the interest of potentially competing department. "The panel
need the establishment of a National Land Rights Protector for managing
high-level conflict between the state and citizens," she said. Didiza added that
the panel recommend an in-depth assessment into the conditions for the
application of land ceilings.
