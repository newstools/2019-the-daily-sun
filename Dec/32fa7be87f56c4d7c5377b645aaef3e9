RICK Ross was supposed to perform in Durban on Saturday at the Block Party event as a headliner. But the show was cancelled at the last minute! Last month it was announced the Maybach Music group founder and award-winning rapper would perform at Durbanâ€™s Kings Park Outer Fields, Buffalo Park Stadium in East London, and Mmabatho Stadium in Mafikeng. The East London show was scheduled to take place yesterday and Rick Ross is billed to perform in Mafikeng tomorrow. According to NuWave Entertainment, the Durban show was cancelled due to a lack of funds to pay service providers.
