THERE was drama at the funeral service for 12-year-old Onkgopotse Moshole on Saturday when mourners booed her gogo and removed her from the podium. The body of little Onkgopotse, who had been hacked to death with an axe, was found at her father’s house two weeks ago. Mourners got angry when gogo Dorcas Mphake took to the podium at the funeral in Danhouse in Moretele, North West. Her son Mpho was bust in connection with the murder. The trouble at the funeral started when Dorcas showered her son with praise, telling mourners he was a good parent. “This child was raised by Mpho. “He took good care of her. You should be like me and avoid entertaining the couple’s issues,” she said. The mourners became furious and told Dorcas she was being insensitive. Many demanded she leave the podium. She was eventually taken away when mourners started drowning her voice out with singing. Moretele mayor Andries Monaheng said the council would erect a tombstone for Onkgopotse and have a remembrance ceremony every year. “We’re struggling with what happened and we’re still traumatised. “It’s sad this happened while we were raising awareness of the abuse of women and children,” he said. The mayor said all men should isolate abusers and murderers. “To all men, we should say enough is enough,” Monaheng said. “We should not make our daughters feel unsafe anywhere. “We should stop killing women and children.”
