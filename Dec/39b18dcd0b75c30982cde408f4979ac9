In Mpumalanga, Barberton Prison would also have its security tightened up, according to Ehlanzeni Region Correctional Services communications manager Messiah Hlungwani.

He said people who tried to smuggle illegal goods into the prison would be prosecuted. “The festive season is challenging, as inmates become restless and are desperate to be with their loved ones,” said Hlungwani. “The beefed-up security plan is part of the national security strategy, including the co-operation of all law enforcement agencies to ensure all people are safe.” He said families would still be allowed to visit inmates between 9am and 2pm. But he urged them not to smuggle illegal goods. In 2017, an attempted escape was prevented after seven prisoners threatened a warder with a toy gun.
