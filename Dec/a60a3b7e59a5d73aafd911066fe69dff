 TO benefit or not to benefit... Pitso Mosimane says he happy to profit from poor referee decisions. The forthright Mamelodi Sundowns coach has been critical of dubious calls from the officials, decisions which he has continuously benefited certain teams only and not everyone. The Brazilians trounced Stellenbosch 3-1 in their catch-up league fixture at Loftus in midweek But the penalty, awarded by referee Khulasande Qongqo, remains a talking point. "If we benefited, why not?" retorted Mosimane. "It's about time. I even shrug my shoulder. I even want an offside on Saturday (TKO) and I will lift the trophy gladly. No problem. "It's the way it is at this point in time. Even a penalty I'll take it. You can minus one goal and make it 2-1. It's up to you." Themba Zwane hit the deck, falling under what appeared a dangerous tackle from Stellies skipper Mogamad De Goede. But replays seemed to suggest otherwise. Zwane dusted himself to coolly equalise after Ryan Moon had put Stellies 1-0 up.
