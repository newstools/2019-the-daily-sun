RAPPER Okmalumkoolkat is officially off the dating market. The singer got hitched to his long-time girlfriend, Princess Zulu. Messages of congratulation have been pouring in thick and fast on his page from celebs and fans alike. Fellow Durbanite and singer, Zakes Bantwini, who refers to Princess Zulu as his daughter, was the first to congratulate the couple. He posted: ”This I love. Look after my daughter (Princess Zulu).” The couple has known each other for years. The rapper once featured Princess Zulu in the Amalobolo video. And if the song is anything to go by, the rapper has finally made enough money to pull amalobolo negotiations through! ??????
