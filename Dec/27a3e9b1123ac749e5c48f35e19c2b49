FOR poor families this time of the year is the most painful one as they don't have food to cook like most families. But poor gogos at Newcastle, KZN who didn't have food to cook during these long holidays especially on Christmas Day, were given groceries and today they are not worried that they don't have any food. This is because the KZN MEC for Health Nomagugu Simelane Zulu put their hearts at ease when she handed out batches of groceries to 50 gogos and toys to disabled children, during a Christmas party held in her hometown, Dannhauser at Newcastle yesterday. And the MEC left smiles across the faces of these poor gogos many of whom would have had a bleak Christmas due to their poor circumstances. MEC Simelane-Zulu said she is pleased and humbled to have been able to bring joy to people’s lives during this time of giving. "As an MEC one has a responsibility to also give back to the community, so we decided to give something that will make their Christmas merry. We say ‘Merry Christmas’ at this time, but for some families it is not necessarily merry because it’s not everyone that has money or food. So, we gave them something to eat, and gave the children toys because the spirit of Father Christmas should be able to cover all the children, including those who are poor," she said. She said it is a nice feeling to be able to give back to communities. "Seeing people excited and pleased with what has happened is priceless," she said. She said she grew up in an environment and era when she knew that where there was a family that did not have money, the community would come together to make sure that they contribute something. "So, we’re trying to bring back that spirit of Ubuntu to look after each other as residents," she said. One of the gogos who received the food parcels Jabu Jiyane (70) said her Christmas was going to be a dull one if the MEC didnt come to give them the groceries. "Im going to have a great Christmas with my family, I'm so grateful," she said.
