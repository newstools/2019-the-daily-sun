DURBAN seems to be ending the year on a very good note. After the municipality was crowned the SA Local Government Association games champion, it now has been named the greenest city in the world. This was revealed by the Husqvarna Urban Green Space Index, a digital project using computer vision and satellite images to get insight into the size and health of green space in urban areas. The recognition came just after the city officially opened the Beachfront Promenade along Durban Beach last month. eThekwini spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said Durban came out on top against 94 cities in the world, followed by R10 De Janero in Brazil in second place and Austin in the US in third place on Tuesday. “The index recognised Durban for its sustainability and greening projects safeguarding green spaces by ensuring they aren’t threatened by urbanisation. “These initiatives are managed by the city’s parks leisure and cemeteries department, which makes Durban more caring and liveable by rolling out climate-resilience strategies and organising open green space,” said Mayisela. Deputy parks head Sibusiso Mkhwanazi said the recognition was because of the city’s greening strategy and policy of planting 80% indigenous trees and 20% exotic plants. “It is setting aside huge natural and green areas known as Dmoss as part of spatial planning. It informs us on what, how and where to plant more trees. Also, as part of creating an urban forest, the city has a programme where we plant trees to rehabilitate eroded areas.” He said Durban has also received two Arbor City Awards from the agriculture department.
