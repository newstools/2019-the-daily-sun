ONE moment, three friends were having a good time, drinking and cooking meat on the stove. Hours later, the shack in which they were chilling caught fire, killing them. Innocent Magomo (49) told Daily Sun his brother Farai (43) was one of those killed in the blaze in Gugulethu, Cape Town, on Tuesday. “We don’t know what happened. We just came here to find him burnt to death,” he said. Innocent said his brother was with two friends, a woman and a man, when the fire killed them. “We need assistance because his family has no place to stay,” he said. Resident Nondumiso Goso (37) said she suspected the fire was caused by a power surge. She said they must have forgotten to put off their main switch when the power went out. “I think the fire started after the electricity came back on,” she said. “Maybe they forgot to switch off the stove and were asleep when the power came on. The fire started at about 5am.” Nwabisa Madolo (42) said she heard people crying out for help but was afraid to go out. “I went out only after hearing people’s voices. By that time, it was already too late,” she said. She blamed Eskom for the tragedy. “If Eskom was not cutting power, they’d still be alive,” she said. Constable Siyabulela Malo said an inquest docket was opened. The cause of the fire had not been established.
