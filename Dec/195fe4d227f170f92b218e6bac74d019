GOSPEL singer Sthembiso Phungula speaks to men on his latest single. The 35-year-old from Bulwer in KZN released his single, Ngenelela Baba, last month. He said it aimed to ask men to do better. He told SunBuzz men needed to learn how to apologise when they were wrong. “The song is about gender-based violence and xenophobia. It’s based on how men disrespect women, children and people from foreign countries,” he said. “They mess up and they don’t apologise. Men have pride and they don’t know how to rectify their mistakes because saying sorry is not part of their vocabulary.” He said the track was also about asking men to learn how to apologise. “I think this song is important and people will love it because it’s different. “Gospel artists are always expected to sing about God, but this song isn’t about Christianity. I hope people, especially men, will learn from it,” he said. Sthembiso said he began singing in the 1990s, but only started taking music seriously in 2008. “I used to sing at school and took part in competitions, but I never thought it would be something I’d make a career out of. When my sister died in 2007, I had to speak at her funeral. “Unfortunately, I couldn’t speak, so I sang instead,” he said. “One of the mourners encouraged me to focus on music because I had a healing voice.” Sthembiso has four albums under his belt. He released his debut album Ebunzimeni in 2008, his second Hallelujah in 2009, his third Isambulo in 2012 and Ngonyama Yezulu was released in 2016.
