SHE wanted to make her boyfriend happy and bought him a pair of shoes. But she had no idea they’d chase him away. Kgomotso Mokoena (38) from Orlando West, Soweto, said she bought the shoes on 30 October. He wore them for a month before he started acting up. He started having night outs with friends, which was unusual. “When I questioned him, he laughed and told me I was being ridiculous,” he said. A week later, he told her he was visiting a cousin in Wattville, Ekurhuleni. “I’d never heard of a relative in Wattville. When I asked him about it, he told me there were family members I didn’t know about,” she said. Kgomotso said the man had now been gone for three weeks. Whenever she called him, it would either be answered by a woman or he’d tell her he was busy and would call later. Her boyfriend Andrew Lebusa (43) told Daily Sun he was just visiting a cousin and needed time away from home. He said he loved his girlfriend and won’t do anything to hurt her. “I needed to see my cousin as we have things to sort out. I don’t understand why she’s being insecure as I’ve never cheated or given her any reason to doubt me.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said buying shoes for a man was bad luck. Cultural expert Mtimande Ngwenya said: “Buying your partner shoes is the end of your relationship. If you want your partner to have shoes, rather give them money.”
