  HE has been on the
run for a long time. But the net finally
closed in on Mohammed Phiri on Thursday. According to the
Hawks in Mpumalanga, Phiri was arrested in Mbombela after a long search for him
even when a warrant of his arrest was issued four months ago. The 35-year-old is
known to be the spokesman for Mpumalanga ANC chairpersonship hopeful Peter
Nyoni. Daily Sun
published an article on 16 September with the headline: “Hawks on trail for
spin doctor”, but Phiri continued to play hide and seek with the cops even
after that. For the past two
years, Phiri campaigned tirelessly together with Nyoni for the Mpumalanga ANC
to be disbanded. He was wanted for
allegedly swindling a tenderpreneur of more than R270 000 in June 2015. Hawks spokeswoman
Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the victim was promised a partnership in a
government tender in Limpopo. Sekgotodi said
R271 000 was allegedly paid to Phiri “as capital for operating costs of a
non-existent multimillion-rand tender to supply water pipes to the Polokwane
municipality”. “Phiri reportedly
disappeared soon after receiving the money. A warrant for his arrest was issued
on 9 September,” she said. Phiri did most of
Nyoni’s media liaison while the politician campaigned to succeed former
Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza. He is expected to
appear before the Nelspruit Magistrates Court soon.
