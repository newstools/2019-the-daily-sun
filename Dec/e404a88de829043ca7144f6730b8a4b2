INKOSI Faku Mdunge resisted colonialism and tried to save his people from exploitation on the mines in the 1800s. This week the KZN Department of Arts and Culture and the AmaDunge celebrated his life of struggle. Premier Sihle Zikalala and MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela unveiled a monument in his honour at the Emadungeni tribal court on Wednesday. The MEC said the monument to honour inkosi Mdunge, who died in 1907, was part of the retelling of the history of indigenous people and to celebrate all those who took colonialism head-on. “Faku resisted land invasion. He prevented his people from going to be enslaved on the mines. This landed him in hot water as he was put under house arrest and prevented from meeting more than 10 people at a time. But that didn’t stop him from leading from the front.” Zikalala thanked the MEC for helping to preserve this part of history, which some people didn’t know. “Many will now know who Faku was. We honour his contribution that help to free his people from slavery. “As the Mdunge nation, you have played a huge role in the freedom of this country,” he said. Zikalala said Mdunge was a hero who cared so much for his people. “Such history should be in books and available at libraries so people will know heroes like him. “The next generation will not know their roots if we don’t preserve this information,” he said. Faku’s great grandson, inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza, said the day brought tears to his family. “We’re very happy that today he’s celebrated. The young generation will now know him,” he said.
