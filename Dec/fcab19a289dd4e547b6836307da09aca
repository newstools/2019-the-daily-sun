ORLANDO Pirates new coach Josef Zinnbauer has solemnly promised to steer the Buccaneers ship to the greater heights. The German mentor was announced by the club on Tuesday to take over from Rhulani Mokwena who has been in charge of the team on interim basis since the departure of Micho. Mokwena endured a tough time in charge of the Bucs. Fans even lost their fate in him as they were calling for his head on Saturday when they were held to a 2-2 draw by Baroka FC. The new man Zinnbauer says he is ready to make the Mighty Buccaneers a great team again. “I welcome the opportunity to lead one of the prestigious clubs on the African continent. I hope under my lead, we are able to return the club to its winning ways,” said Zinnbauer. "I like a dominant and passionate style of play and ball possession is important to me," He added: "There is a quality with our players and we have to reach the team's full potential with discipline, hard work and dedication.""I expect everyone at the club to give their best. It will not be easy but we will do our best to make Pirates become great again.""What I can promise to the Pirates fans, I will work hard with passion for this great club and now I'm very happy I wear the Orlando Pirates colours."
