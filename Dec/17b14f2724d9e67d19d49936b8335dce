Eskom, which implemented stage 1 load shedding overnight, says it will switch to stage 2 load shedding from 9am until 11pm on Friday. "The system remains vulnerable and while we have returned units as scheduled, we have also lost additional generating units today," the power utility said in a statement on its Twitter account. "Load shedding will be required overnight and all day on Friday to cater for further trips and to create capacity to replenish water reserves for our pumped storage schemes."Find your load shedding scheduleStage 2 load shedding allows for up to 2 000MW - just under 5% of Eskom's nominal capacity - to be shed from the national grid. Stage 1 load shedding allows for 1 000MW to be shed.  In a statement issued earlier on Thursday, Eskom said rotational power cuts are likely to continue for the remainder of the week, as it continues to battle severe capacity constraints caused by a combination of heavy rains and unplanned breakdowns.
