   Imprisoned Mpumalanga Master of the High Court, Bina Masuku
and her bogus lawyer boyfriend want to be moved from the current jail. Elvis Kgosiemang told the Nelspruit Magistrate Court that
the prison facility they are in is not conducive for them as it is overcrowded. The court heard this on Thursday, through an affidavit read
by their attorney, Dimakatso Mashego. In the last appearance, their case was postponed to January
but on Wednesday they had appointed a new attorney with an aim of getting out on
jail and avoid spending Christmas behind bars. The pair aged 44 and 35 are facing charges of corruption,
fraud and contravention of immigration act were arrested early last month. Their attorney, Mashego said through a written affidavit
that the pair said it was unfair for them to be kept in custody. Masuku and Kgosiemang have filed for an urgent bail
application after they were denied bail last month. According to Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman, Captain Dineo
Sekgotodi, Masuku allegedly directed claimants to Kgosiemang to process their
claims. Some claimants reportedly never received their monies - Instead
it was shared among the two. Sekgotodi said so far almost R1.4 million has since
disappeared from eight families. Magistrate Leonard Mncanca postponed the matter to Friday for
the continuation of the bail application.
