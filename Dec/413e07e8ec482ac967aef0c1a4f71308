HE THOUGHT he could make a quick trip with endangered baby tortoises to a hitchhiking spot and not go unnoticed. But cops in Kuruman, Northern Cape, bust him on Friday. The suspect, in his 50s, was on his way to Lesotho carrying baby tortoises, lizard skin and springbok horns. The endangered geometric tortoise is a critically endangered species of tortoise. A muthi man, who didn’t want to be named, said: “Geometric tortoises are used as muthi to grow any business. “They’re mixed with muthi then buried at the place of business to attract people. “They are taken to mountains in Lesotho where izinyanga burn them and mix the fat of the tortoises with muthi in a bottle. “This practice has been going on for years and many people have found riches after using it. Others use the shell and hang it around their necks to bring luck.” Police spokesman Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba said: “The suspect was stopped by patrolling cops while walking on the N14 in Kuruman. “It’s understood he was hitchhiking to Lesotho. “Officers searched him and found nine baby tortoises, lizard skin and springbok horns. “The man will appear in court today on a charge of possessing endangered species.”
