Mamelodi Sundowns have confirmed that their CAF Champions League clash away at USM Alger will take place on Saturday, December 28, meaning the club will play six games in 21 days, which includes two trips to North Africa. It is a hectic, almost harrowing schedule for Pitso Mosimane’s side to end the year, also includes the Telkom Knockout final against Maritzburg United on December 14 and three crucial league games as they attempt to keep pace with Kaizer Chiefs at the top of the Absa Premiership table. “This has become the norm for a team fighting in the Champions League and for domestic cup honours,” club administrator Yogesh Singh told the Sundowns website. “The squad will need to step up in the coming weeks, these are all critical games that we need to win both domestically and abroad.” Sundowns take on old foes Wydad Casablanca in the Champions League in Morocco on Saturday, before returning to Tshwane for a league game against Stellenbosch on Wednesday. They then meet Maritzburg in the Telkom Knockout final in Durban on December 14, and three days later have a tough domestic league game at BidVest Wits. They host Polokwane City on December 21 in their final Premiership game of the year, before making their way to north Africa again to meet USM Alger a week later.
