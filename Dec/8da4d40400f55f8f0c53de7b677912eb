DELRON Buckley has had doors slammed in his face many times that he has given up on getting a coaching job locally. Like many ex-players, the former Bafana Bafana midfielder has armed himself with the requisite qualifications to coach in any football structure, including development. But opportunities have been hard to come by for Buckley. “I’m not recognised locally. There are rarely opportunities for former players like myself,” said Buckley. “I’ve contacted local teams, SuperSport United and Chippa United among others, offering my services in the various structures. But no reply has come forth. I’ve come to accept it. I’ve even went to Manchester United to put up my license for development work and I’m hoping for a positive feedback. Former players are recognised mostly in Europe than at home.” Buckley scored 10 goals in 73 matches for Bafana and was a member of the famous Amaglug-glug 2000 Olympics squad. He further said many overseas players are hardly recognised when they return home. But he remains hopeful. “I’d love to coach. I’ll be doing my Uefa A license in March, before I can apply for Pro B license. The German DFA cover the costs for players who have played in Germany. I’m hopeful there will be opportunities. It is important to have qualifications,” Buckley said. While he may be largely unrecognised at home, Buckley is still a hero in Bochum. At the age of 17, the Durban-born Buckley was snapped up by German side VFL Bochum. He spent most of his career in Germany, going through Bochum’s youth teams and debuting in the Bundesliga in 1995 when he was 21 years old. He also played for Arminia Bielefeld and Borussia Dortmund before returning home to sign with Maritzburg United. .
