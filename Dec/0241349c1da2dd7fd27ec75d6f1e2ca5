MARKING World Aids Day yesterday, Deputy President David Mabuza kept his promise to a resident in Klerksdorp, North West. Earlier this year, Honey Stevenson’s daughter asked him to find her mum a job. Yesterday, he said government would employ Honey to educate people about the virus. In Katlehong in Gauteng, athletes and health fans gathered at Huntersfield Stadium for the World Aids Day road race.  Mayoral committee member Nomadlozi Nkosi said: “The aim of the day is to raise awareness and offer support to the affected.” Speaker Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces chairman Amos Masondo released a statement: “This day calls on all of us to unite in the fight against HIV.”  “Ugu, uMkhanyakude and uMzinyathi districts achieved the targets a year early, while Amajuba, eThekwini, King Cetshwayo, uMgungundlovu, uThukela, and Zululand are expected to do so by March,” said Zikalala.
