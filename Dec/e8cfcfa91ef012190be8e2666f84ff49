THEY dreamt of a memorable wedding but had no idea how they wanted it to be. They read an article in Daily Sun a few months ago, where a couple got married on a grader. This gave Jabulani Zwane (40) and his girlfriend Sithembiso Nkosi (34) the idea to get married on the back of a truck. The couple from Newcastle, northern KZN, tied the knot on Saturday and drove around Osizweni kasi. Jabulani told the People’s Paper he and his wife Sithembiso wanted their wedding to be different. They used the truck as the venue for the ceremony and reception. Sthembiso said they were happy people liked their idea. “We are excited that people around the country are talking about our wedding. We are happy that we’re still trending.” Jabulani said he met Sithembiso while she was 16 years and they have two kids, aged 12 and 11. He’s a businessman, while Sthembiso runs a mobile kitchen in the area. The wedding was shared on social media by Bongumusa Zwane, who helped Daily Sun trace the couple. He said he was on the street when he saw the wedding convoy. People were whistling and ululating and he took a video.
