STRASBOURG striker Lebo Mothiba appears to have shrugged off this sluggish start to the season in the French Ligue 1. The Bafana Bafana marksman has battled to recapture the form which forced Strasbourg to prise him from Lille last season. But he may have hit rediscovered his midas touch, having netted his third of the season as Strasbourg edged Toulouse 4-2 on Saturday. Of course, banging three goals in 16 matches, Mothiba has not particularly set the scene alight. But he would be happy to be back in the goals and providing assists, as was the case when he set up Adrien Thomasson against Toulouse. Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki would have been delighted to see his prime striker hitting form.
