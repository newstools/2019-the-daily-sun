ETHEKWINI is bracing itself to successfully defend its Salga Games championship title. But to retain it, the municipality, which is hosting the games this year, needs to beat 11 district municipalities that will be participating in various sporting categories over four days. Last year, eThekwini came out on top after beating several municipalities in the province. The games started yesterday and will end on Sunday in Durban. Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela was confident the municipality would remain champions as all its participants had prepared themselves well. “We understand no one came here to lose. Everyone came here to be crowned champions, but we are ready and we’ll fight tooth and nail to defend the title,” he said. The games were launched in 1998. They have produced household names such as Comrades Marathon multiple winner Bongmusa Mthembu and football players including Siyabonga Sangweni, Siyabonga Nkosi, Amanda Dlamini and Veronica Phewa. Arts, Culture, Sport and Recreation MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela said the games were in line with the department’s vision to create an active and winning KZN. “By hosting the games, in partnership with Salga KZN, the Department of Sport and Recreation is giving thousands of young people opportunities to participate at all levels,” she said. “Selections for the games involved youth from ward and local municipality levels. Teams are then selected to represent the different districts. This is part of our programme to identify, nurture and develop talent.”
