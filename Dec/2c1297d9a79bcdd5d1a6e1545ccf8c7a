THEY were together for seven years, but their relationship ended. His ex locked his 4-5 and said she’d only unlock it if he married her. Nicholas Mofokeng (38) from Holomisa, Ekurhuleni, said he and his ex were lovey-dovey in the beginning. He’d even promised her marriage. They started living together three years into the relationship. But Nicholas claimed his ex-girlfriend Lindiwe Zungu (33) started to show her true colours. “She started to control me. She became my mum instead of being my girlfriend,” he said. He said when he ended the relationship she was furious. “She told me she’d go to the most powerful sangoma and lock my 4-5. “I thought she was joking until I tried to poke my new girlfriend.” Doctors told him he was probably stressed.  “When I tried to poke again, my 4-5 didn’t work,’ he said. “I went to a sangoma, who told me my ex locked it. “When I called her, she laughed and said I should marry her or else I won’t poke for the rest of my life.” Lindiwe told Daily Sun: “He wasted my time. I love him and he’s not going anywhere. I’m too old to start new relationships.” Lindiwe said Nicholas’ 4-5 belonged to her. Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said: “It depends on how long the muthi has been in your system. It might take longer, but we can have it removed.”
