A DECEMBER tokoloshe is terrorising his relationship. But his girlfriend thinks it’s just an excuse not to give her his bonus. Tankiso Mathibedi (45) from Wattville in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun his problem started three years ago after he refused to buy his ex a car. “She told me she wouldn’t stay with someone who’s selfish.” He said he was relieved when they broke up as she used to waste money.  “I loved her and I wanted to spoil her, but she’d force me to do things for her,” said Tankiso. He said he got a new girlfriend and they were happy until their first December together.  He said his girlfriend now thought he was making excuses so he could eat his bonus in peace. He said various sangomas said he was cursed by his ex. His lover Mathapelo Mokwena (38) said: “The fact that his 4-5 doesn’t wake up is true. He wakes up wet throughout December and looks like a happy man. A woman can only handle so much.”  But his ex, Lorraine Mokone (41), said he was being ridiculous. “Yes, I asked him for a car which he didn’t buy, but I’ve moved on. The universe is obviously dealing with him and I can’t say I sympathise.” Sangoma Joseph Dungamanzi said although he’s never heard of a December tokoloshe, getting rid of it wouldn’t be a problem.
