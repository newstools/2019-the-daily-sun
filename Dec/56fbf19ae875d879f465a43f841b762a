Anti-apartheid icon and retired Cape Town archbishop Desmond
Tutu appeared "in good spirits" on Thursday at the hospital where he
is being treated for an infection, his successor said. Tutu, hailed as the moral compass of the nation, was
admitted to a Cape Town hospital on Wednesday for a "stubborn
infection". Aged 88, he has been under treatment for prostate cancer for
more than two decades.  "I found him to be in good spirits and seemingly
responding well to the excellent medical care that he is receiving," said
former Cape Town archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane in a statement. "He was as alert as ever and to me appeared to be well
on the road to recovery." Ndungane - who worked closely with Tutu before and after the
end of the apartheid regime in 1994 - said he felt "buoyed" by the
archbishop's "continued zest for life". Tutu was last hospitalised in September 2018 for "a
series of tests" and discharged after two weeks. In 2016 he underwent minor surgery for a persistent
infection linked to his prostate cancer treatment. Tutu gained worldwide prominence for his strong opposition
to white-minority rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 and retired from public
life in 2010. Tutu appeared in good health earlier this year when he met
Britain's Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their baby Archie, who were visiting
South Africa.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/tutu-in-good-spirits-and-recovering-well-says-ndungane-20191205
