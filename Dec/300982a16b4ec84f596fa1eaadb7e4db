THE death of former Cape Town gang boss Rashied Staggie should be celebrated. “The manner he died is the manner he lived,” Haroon Orrie, the national spokesman for People Against Gangsterism and Drugs said on Tuesday. “So many innocent lives have been lost through this person,” said Orrie.

Something we need to celebrate rather than worry about what may happen.” Staggie, the former leader of the Hard Livings gang, was shot while he was sitting in his car in front of his house on London Road in Salt River on Friday. He was declared dead on arrival at a nearby hospital. Photos of the once feared crime boss circulated shortly after his death, showing the tattooed Staggie in a bloody Hawaiian shirt. On Tuesday, police spokeswoman Brigadier Novela Potelwa confirmed no arrests had been made. FAKE GUNS LAND 72 SUSPECTS BEHIND BARS! Potelwa said Western Cape anti-gang unit detectives were hard at work pursuing specific leads. Rashied and his twin brother Rashaad were once among the most feared gang leaders on the Cape Flats. Rashaad was shot and set alight on London Road in 1996 during a demonstration by the Pagad, which was formed in the 1990s to combat gangsterism on the Cape Flats. In 2003, Rashied was jailed for 15 years for his role in the kidnapping and rape of a teenage girl, and in 2004 he was sentenced to 13 years for stealing firearms from a police armoury. Staggie served 11 years in prison. Pastor Ivan Waldeck told eNCA Staggie had become a reborn Christian, saying he didn’t know who would have wanted to kill him. – NEWS24
