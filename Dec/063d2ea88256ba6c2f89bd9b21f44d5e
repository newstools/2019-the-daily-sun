HE allegedly robbed the shop a few months ago and got away with it. But the dumb thug went back to the same shop! Only this time, when he went into the shop in the Bloemfontein CBD on Wednesday morning, the workers recognised him. The cops were called and the man was bust.  A staff member said two months ago the same man came with a gun and robbed them of money. Said the worker: “I’m not sure if it was a real gun or a toy one. This time we didn’t allow him to steal. We also want to get our salaries.” The owner of the takeaway shop was not in when the thug came. “I’m proud of my brave staff, who managed to lock the doors and call the police, who came and arrested the man,” he said.  Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said members of the Parkweg cop shop’s visible policing unit arrested a 25-year-old suspect at a shop on Henry Street.  When the suspect walked into the shop on Wednesday, workers identified him and called the cops. “The suspect was not armed. A case of attempted robbery was registered and the suspect will appear in court soon.” Meanwhile, Makhele said 16 illegal guns, two toy guns and 113 bullets were confiscated in the Free State between 26 November and 2 December.
