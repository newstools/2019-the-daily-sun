BOOZING South Africans drink like there’s no tomorrow. Mzansi is the world’s number six consumer of booze, according to World Health Organisation figures released on Tuesday. It said 69% of adults haven’t had a drink for 12 months, but most of the remaining 31% were heavy or binge drinkers.  “Mzansi’s a beer-drinking nation, taking up 56% of all alcohol consumed,” it said. Some boozers said life would be hell if they stopped drinking. Busisiwe Motha (25) said she only stopped when pregnant.  Bongumusa Mbatha (32) grew up with heavy drinkers. “I can’t wait to chill with the guys and drink beer,” he said.  Gogo Nomsa Mazibuko (72) said marriage stress led her to the bottle.“I’ll die drinking.” The organisation said alcohol causes social and health troubles, including road deaths.
