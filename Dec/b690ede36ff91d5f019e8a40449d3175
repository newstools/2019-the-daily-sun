Eleven people were killed on road accidents this past long weekend and over hundred arrested. The Gauteng Department of Community Safety has expressed concern about the growing rate of reckless driving as well as drinking and driving. “Over 140 drivers were found driving under the influence of alcohol. Driving under the influence of alcohol and substance abuse often results in impaired driving, causing unnecessary accidents and loss of lives. Eleven people also lost their lives due to fatal crashes,” said the department spokesman, Ofentse Morwane. The long weekend saw traffic rising as many embarked on their journey to various holiday destinations. The department has urged motorists including public transport drivers to comply with the rules of the road during this festive season. The department has further called law enforcement agencies to intensify road safety. Morwane said drunk drivers, unroadworthy vehicles and freight overloading were some of the major contributing factors towards fatal crashes. “Importantly, the department also wants to issue a stern warning to road users who continue to undermine the rule of law by drinking and driving, offering bribes and committing fraud every time they are in conflict with the law. “The department will also complement law enforcement initiatives by deploying community patrollers at identified targeted parks and open spaces as well as public transport hubs,” added Morwane.
