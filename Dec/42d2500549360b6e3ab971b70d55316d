CRIME in Nyanga is spiralling out of control! It’s so rife that cops in the Cape Town kasi recently offered to escort the drivers of e-hailing taxi companies Uber and Bolt.

Brigadier Vuyisile Ncatha told Daily Sun the drivers were often targeted by thugs in the kasi. “One of them was killed recently. That’s is why we’ve decided to escort them,” he said. “We’ll continue to do so while we think of our next move. Once we meet them, we will know what to do. But for now, I don’t want them going there on their own.” Asked whether the decision would affect the police’s ability to carry out their work as they often complained of a lack of vans, Ncatha said: “Yes, this means more work for us, but we are trying to save lives.” A few months ago, the cops pleaded with Uber and Bolt drivers to stop doing business in Nyanga because of the high rate of hijackings and robberies. Resident Nandipha Mlungwana (38) said the cops were doing a good thing. “These drivers have been victims for too long,” she said. Siyolise Matu (40) said some Uber and Bolt drivers wouldn’t make a stop at the police station because they were more worried about money than their safety.
