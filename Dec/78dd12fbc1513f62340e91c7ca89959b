Event host and former Ukhozi FM station manager, Bhodloza Nzimande, thanked Phuzekhemisi for putting maskandi on the map. “Phuzekhemisi raised sensitive issues through music.

Artists Mfiliseni Magubane, Mbuzeni Mkhize, Nyonemhlophe, Abafana BakaMgqumeni, Ichwane Lebhaca and Professor took turns to thank him for his contribution to the industry.  Nyonemhlophe thanked him for introducing him to maskandi. “I grew up listening to his music. At that time I didn’t even know I had a talent. But today I’m proud to say I’m his product. “He actually discovered me, introduced me to the industry and nurtured me,” said Nyonemhlophe. Phuzekhemisi thanked people for honouring the event. “I could’ve done this event somewhere else, but decided to do it here in my village. This was important for me because you have supported my work.
