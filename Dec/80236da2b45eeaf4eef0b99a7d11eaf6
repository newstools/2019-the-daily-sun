Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp lambasted his defence after the 5-3 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday evening. Chiefs trailed 3-2 at the break but rallied back to win 5-3 in the end. And Middendorp believes the defensive problems are not down to a lack of quality but rather a question of attitude. "Entertaining game, I think the number of goals is good for supporters, there's no doubt about it. First half I think we had a huge attitude issue, not really in the game, we didn't want to move like we should, could be," Middendorp told SuperSport TV. "Like we have done to get this position we're in at the moment. Much better in the second-half, I think in the end fully deserved three points for us and it's good for us." Amakhosi were diabolical at the back, especially in the first 45, and the German tactician was scathing of his side's defensive work, saying that it was not even at the level of an U12 side. "I would not say it's under-12, then I would insult the under-12 defensive work. I don't know what's below, if there's an under-8 or an under-17, mean really, national team players and there's nothing to blame, as I said it's not the quality, it's just the attitude," said the 61-year-old. "Where we're sitting now we think we can do less, we cannot. We have to fight each and every team first on the ground and then we can score and celebrate. But if you go into a game and you want to just do a little bit of a Prima donna, there's no chance to win a game in this league." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
