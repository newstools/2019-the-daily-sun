Cricket South Africa's (CSA) former acting chief financial officer (CFO), Ziyanda Nkuta, has been suspended. According to Sport24Â Nkuta, who had served as acting as CFO since October 2017 and had served as the organisation's financial manager since mid-2015, was given news of her suspension on Thursday. She had, however, previously stepped down from her post as acting CFO in June this year, CSA says, and was serving in another capacity at the time of hearing of her suspension in her final month's notice period. Nkuta last spoke publicly in April on CSA's projected four-year R654 million loss, insisting that the organisation was not in a financial crisis. Details surrounding her suspension are yet to be confirmed, but at least two other employees were suspended on Thursday. They are procurement manager Lundi Maja and administrator Dalene Nolan. Two independent board directors - Iqbal Khan and Shirley Zinn - also resigned from their posts this week. This comes at a time where CSA CEO Thabang Moroe and his leadership have came in for heavy criticism following what has been a disastrous few days for the organisation. - Sport24
