Mpumalanga police have launched
a manhunt for a man who is believed to be from Eswatini to help in solving the
murder case of former community safety spokesman Joseph Mabuza. Mabuza lost his life when he was knocked down by a bakkie while traveling in a
motorcycle on the N4 in December last year. The suspect has been on the run since 23 December 2018 after the incident
happened along the N4 road at Hectorspruit, near Komatipoort while he was on
his way back from a work assignment. It is believed that a fugitive may have recklessly executed a U-turn on the
busy road, in the process causing a serious crash with Mabuza who was on a
motorbike and was fatally wounded at the scene. The unknown driver simply disappeared from the crime scene before authorities could
arrive. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said Mabuza was on duty dealing with
safety issues on the road during the festive season. “He was traveling on a motorcycle on the N4 from Komatipoort to Nelspruit, when
an oncoming Isuzu bakkie allegedly recklessly turned in front of him resulting
in a fatal collision,” he said. "The driver of the Isuzu bakkie disappeared right after the accident. He
was later identified as Kwanele Sitsebe Shabangu from the Kingdom of Eswatini
and a warrant of arrest was issued against him,” Hlathi said. “We request anyone with information that may lead to the arrest of the suspect
to contact the Komatipoort police branch Commander for detectives Captain Loui
Stander on 082 4490 242 or Brigadier Leonard Hlathi on 082 462 0804.”
