THREE suspects were bust during the funeral of a gang member on Saturday. Cops in Welkom, Free State, were monitoring the funeral when they received a tip-off about houses with drugs. Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said the anti-gang unit made the arrests after they searched the houses at New Stands section in Thabong. “While monitoring the funeral of a gang member in Thabong, the unit received information about two houses where drugs were being sold,” he said. “The members reacted swiftly to information, and on arrival at the first address they arrested a 33-year-old man after finding mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of R30 000 and an undisclosed amount of cash. “They proceeded to another address in the same vicinity and found a 32-year-old man with mandrax with an estimated street value of R10 000 and a large amount of cash.” Makhele said after the two busts, unit members came across a 28-year-old man who fled after seeing their cars. He was found in possession of mandrax worth R1 000. “A 38-year-old man and his live-in girlfriend were arrested for dealing in dagga,” said Makhele. Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Moeketsi Sempe said the police would continue to clean the streets of Thabong and Welkom of drugs. “We urge the community to continue reporting incidents through the MySAPS app or to call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.” All arrested suspects will appear in the Welkom Magistrates Court soon.
