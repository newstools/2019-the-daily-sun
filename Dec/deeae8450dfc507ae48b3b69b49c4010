COULD this be Jomo Cosmosâ€™ last season in the GladAfrica Championship? In the past 10 seasons, Cosmos has been a yo-yo team from the Absa Premiership to the National First Division, now the GladAfrica Championship. In three relegation periods, Cosmos spent eight of these seasons in the lower division. In the recent two seasons, things seem to be going from bad to worse. Cosmos owner/coach Jomo Sono does not seem to have a plan on how to steer the sinking ship. Cosmos went into the Christmas recess with their worst record in the league where they had won only two matches after 14 games. With teams having reached the halfway stage of the season, things are starting to take shape. Two teams will be relegated to the ABC Motsepe League. At this rate, Ezenkosi are among the teams that are facing the dreaded axe and they could go down like former PSL Champions Santos and Moroka Swallows. Cosmos are second bottom with 12 points, two ahead of bottom club Royal Eagles, but Ezenkosi have a match in hand over Eagles. Last season Cosmos survived the axe by a whisker on the last day of the season. They had a terrible campaign which Sono said they learned a lot from with their youngsters. But it looks like they have not turned the corner. When the second-round resumes in January Mjomana will need to have a solid plan to turn things around. They will kick off the second round with a mouth-watering clash when they visit Swallows FC at Dobsonville Stadium on 18 January. Cosmos are not the only team that will need to shape up in the second round. From 10th placed Cape Umoya United no one is safe as a total of seven clubs are only separated by eight points from Eagles. Nedbank Cup defending champions TS Galaxy are also in the mix. Galaxy took part in Caf Confederation Cup and that looks to have affected their league performance. In 14 games, they managed to collect 17 points.
