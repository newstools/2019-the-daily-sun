A MAN was killed and three others are fighting for their lives. They were attacked while sharing stokvel savings at Thenjane Village in Umkomaas, south of Durban, on Tuesday. Three armed men stormed the rondavel and opened fire. KGAUGELO WAS BURNT IN HER MINI COOPER! Brothers Mandlakhe and Mzwakhe Nene, Mangidi Mngoma and Bakhephi Ntuli were wounded and rushed to hospital.  Mandlakhe died. One of the stokvel members said they had just started counting the money when three armed men entered the rondavel. She screamed and a man shot in her direction, but the bullet hit Bakhephi in the head. Said the member: “I was sitting facing the door when I saw a man I recognised. He told me to shut up and shot at me, but the bullet hit Bakhephi, who sat next to me. “Two more men entered the house, ordered everyone to lie down, and started collecting the cash.” 'MLUNGU WHO KILLED ANELE WAS NOT A FARMER' The men returned a few minutes later and said there was more money in a dish a female member was lying on. One of the men kicked the member before taking all the money from under her. She said they had not finished counting the money, but over R200 000 was taken. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cases of murder, attempted murder and armed robbery were opened.  A 67-year-old man died.
