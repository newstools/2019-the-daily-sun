They said Eskom has lost generation units, increasing unplanned breakdowns to 14 200MW and has a higher demand of about 600MW. They said some power stations had experienced flooding because of the heavy rain. “Load shedding is a responsible act and highly controlled and implemented to protect the country from national blackout,” said the utility. Since Thursday, Mzansi has been in and out of the dark. Eskom has issued tips on things to do during load shedding: - Use a battery powered torch instead of candles to avoid fires. - Installing a surge protection device can help minimise some damage in unforeseen situations when the power goes off or is restored. - Be vigilant when arriving or leaving your house at night when the street lights aren’t working. - Always make sure that your cellphones and laptops are fully charged. - You can either use a 3G internet dongle or your smart phone as a modem for your laptop to keep you connected to the internet during load shedding.
