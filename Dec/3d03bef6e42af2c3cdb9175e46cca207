Springbok Sevens ace Rosko Specman scored a brace as the Blitzboks powered their way into the Dubai Sevens quarterfinals with their second win in as many games, dispatching Spain 35-5 in their pool game on Friday. Specman opened and closed the scoring with trademark tries in the match as the Blitzboks upped the ante in their performance after a stuttering start on day one of the tournament. Their win, coupled with the victory over Kenya on day one sees them now on a collision course with England to determine who will top the group after the pool phases. Apart from Specman, veteran Chris Dry, speedster Siviwe Soyizwapi and JC Pretorius all crossed the whitewash to complete the big victory over a tricky Spanish side. Pol Pla scored Spainâ€™s only try in the game. England struggled to beat Kenya 12-5 in their pool game after some strong play by the Kenyan team, who have definitely been more competitive in this tournament than in the entire previous season. The game between the Blitzboks and England kicks off at 5.54pm (CAT, GMT+2) and will be shown live on SuperSport. -SuperSport
