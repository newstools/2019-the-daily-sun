RESIDENTS of Benoni, Ekurhuleni, have had enough of the violence caused by illegal miners. This after seven bodies were found dumped on the N12 Puttfontein off-ramp on Thursday night. Residents said they complained to cops about the zama zamas, but nothing was being done to shut down the mines. Mzamo Mhayise (39) said they were not safe. “We cannot live in an area full of criminal activities by the people we complain about,” said Mzamo. Velly Makhubo (41) said he feared for his life and would move if he could afford it. “It’s unfortunate we always report the zama zamas, but nothing is done. We keep waking up and finding bodies.” Zintathu Mgolombane (33) said she understood the unemployment rate was high, but she wanted illegal mines shut down. “I wish something was done about unemployment. “It’s causing chaos and people are fighting and killing each other over little sacks of gold dust,” she said. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Noxolo Kweza told Daily Sun a murder case was being investigated. “The bodies were discovered with bullet wounds and one body had burnt wounds. At this stage it’s not clear what happened,” said Kweza. “Police are still in the process of identifying the bodies, which are all men. “It’s suspected the men might have been killed underground and might be part of the ongoing illegal mining activities,” she said. Ekurhuleni EMS spokesman William Ntladi said they received a call from a passerby who saw the bodies. “We’re appealing to communities to assist in identifying the bodies, which are estimated to be aged between 30 and 40,” said Ntladi. Anyone with information about the incident should call 08600 10111 or Captain Amos Manetha on 082 411 4677.
