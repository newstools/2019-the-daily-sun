Maritzburg United head coach Eric Tinkler lamented the unfairness of having to do interviews with the media so soon after an agonising loss. Maritzburg had a late goal correctly disallowed for offside late on in the Telkom Knockout final as they fell to a heart-breaking 2-1 loss to Mamelodi Sundowns at Moses Mahbida Stadium on Saturday. While the linesman made the right call, it was incredibly tight and Tinkler seemed convinced his player was onside and the goal should have stood. However, speaking to the media after the match, he was reluctant to comment on the incident while emotions were still running high. "No comment, you shouldn't be asking me this question really," he said after the game. "So ja, move on to the next one please. I should never be doing interviews ten minutes after the game. "You know emotions are high, that's a question you shouldn't be asking me." He also backed goalkeeper Richard Ofori, who made an error to allow Sundowns to equalise and get back into the game after the Team of Choice had taken a first-half lead. "Obviously there was disappointment, I think he hesitated to come, that spit second decision that took long, ended up costing him. "Normally he would be coming out and collecting those but they are only human, they gonna make mistakes, same as referees, so we gotta move on," he said -Sport24
