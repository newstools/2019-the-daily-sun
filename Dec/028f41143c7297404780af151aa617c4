 I have known my boyfriend for three years and also introduced him to my family. After the introduction he got to be very close to my older sister. Recently when I came back home from writing my exams, I found the two in bed together hot at it. The two did not even look up to see me when I opened the bedroom door which we share with my sister. I was so shocked I ran out into the streets and heard from my neighbhours that my boyfriend tries to run after me. I have stopped taking his calls and have refused to let my sister explain this betrayal. I just cannot deal with this situation but its been a month now since I caught them. How can my own sister do that to me? Please help?
