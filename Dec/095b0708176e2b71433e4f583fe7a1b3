CONSTRUCTION of temporary houses for residents whose homes were ravaged by tornadoes is under way. Victims of the tornado in New Hanover, KZN Midlands, will be housed in these structures until their homes are built. Those whose houses were partially damaged will be given building material. Premier Sihle Zikalala said on Wednesday the damage, following the two tornadoes which hit KZN in October, was estimated at R560 million. Zikalala said 31 people had been confirmed dead and others were affected because of bad weather since October. About 135 people were injured, and 3 072 households and 15 540 people were affected. The victims were receiving assistance from different departments. “The human settlements department has appointed service providers to be on standby to supply building material. “The damage is still being counted. The magnitude impacts quickly on human settlements, schools and roads.” Zikalala said Home Affairs and Sassa were helping people who lost important documents. He appealed to residents to respect weather warnings. Resident Isaac Shabalala (52), whose house was partially damaged, told Daily Sun he was grateful for the support he was getting from various departments. “We’ve received building material and will start fixing our house.” Thabo Zondi (56) also received building material. “The temporary houses are now being built,” said Thabo.
