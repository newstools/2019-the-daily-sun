IT SEEMS there’s a faction in the IFP that doesn’t accept new leader Velenkosini Hlabisa. In a 25-second video clip heard by Daily Sun, a person believed to be IFP KZN chairman Thami Ntuli, who’s also Nkandla mayor, can be heard ordering people not to refer to Hlabisa as the leader. Ntuli was apparently addressing IFP supporters at Melmoth Town Hall in northern KZN hall recently. He can be heard telling a crowd chanting “viva Ngotsha”, which is Hlabisa’s clan name, not to call him the leader. “When I say ubani umholi, you must say uShenge,” said Ntuli. The crowd then says Shenge is the leader. A source within the party said Ntuli never wanted Hlabisa as leader. The source said there was even talk in the party of printing T-shirts with both Buthelezi and Hlabisa’s faces. Buthelezi still leads the party in parliament, while Hlabisa leads the party in the KZN legislature. When contacted for comment, Hlabisa referred Daily Sun to party spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa, who lashed out at people who distributed the video. He said there was nothing wrong with what Ntuli did because it was explained at the party’s extended national executive committee meeting that slogans would remain attached to Buthelezi until Hlabisa had established his own legacy in the party. “There are slogans attached to a particular leader because of his achievements. They are like praises which can’t be inherited,” he said Ntuli didn’t respond to messages.
