MAMELODI Sundowns have been left to count the cost following the shock departure of Emiliano Tade. The Argentine joined the Tshwane club from AmaZulu in January, recruited in a deal in a region of R6 million, which also involved the transfer of Bongi Ntuli to Usuthu. But Tade didn’t prove a good investment for the Tshwane club, admitted club legal guru Yogesh Singh. “He’s explained his situation and as a club we felt it was a right to do,” said Singh. “Given the situation and his reasons , we understood his decision.” The club dropped a bombshell when they announced the Argentine has asked to be released from his contract. “He decided that he is going back to New Zealand. That’s his home, not Argentina,” said Downs coach Pitso Mosimane, at pains to describe how he tried talking the Argentine out of his decision. “I tried to convince him to think about it (quitting) before we went to Morocco. I told him to sleep on it. But he said ‘coach I’m done. I have never had so many injuries.’ Even the South Americans (Ali Meza, Gaston Sirino, Ricardo Nascimento and Mauricio Affonso) tried to convince him. But he said ‘coach, I am done’. “He came and he spoke to the boys and he was in tears. I brought him to my house. “I tried to convince him but he was in tears and he said no.” The injury-prone marksman scored only two goals in 12 appearances, but Mosimane had been keen to get him more involved in the Caf Champions League. Added Mosimane: “He said I can keep him in the team but he won’t come to training. “He said, ‘I won’t play football so what are you going to do? “You are going to fetch me from my house? “What are you going to do? Economically it is not good for us because we just bought him, but what are you going to do if he says ‘I don’t want to play football anymore?” Meanwhile, Rivaldo Coetzee has undergone x-ray on his ankle following a horrible injury he sustained in their 3-1 league win against Stellenbosch FC in midweek.
