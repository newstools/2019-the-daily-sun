MANY people on social media were shocked to see Mmusi Maimane officiating a wedding. But Maimane told Daily Sun he was just doing it for his former colleague. PABALLO'S LOVER: MY WIFE DID NOT KILL HER! The former DA leader, who is also a pastor, married Graham Charters and Siya Hayi at Cavalli Estates in Stellenbosch, Western Cape, at the weekend. He said he was asked by the couple to marry them and he did it. Maimane said he also helped the groom, who is the DA’s chief of staff, with the lobola negotiations a few months ago. Maimane gave the couple an encouring message at their wedding. Graham said: “He spoke about faith, love and hope, and said our relationship and marriage will bring hope not just to us, but to the nation.” He shared with Daily Sun how he met Siya. “We were both law students at UCT but we never met. So we started following each other on Twitter and one day I sent her a DM asking to take her out for coffee,” he said. Many people had a lot to say about the pictures on Twitter. Fortune Kighlex wrote: “Good to see pastor Mmusi following his calling. Leave politics to politicians.” Miss Masombuka: “I love how few of our people seem to correlate the rise in visibility of these relationships and marriages with the land issue. For a long time we have been ignoring the existence of mixed race marriages.” Across_the_universe: “Mmusi is clearly committed to a non-racial South Africa.” Miss Tlolo: “The pastor saw that he can unite the country in other ways.”
