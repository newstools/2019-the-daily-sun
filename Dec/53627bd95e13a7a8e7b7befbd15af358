THIS year’s summer circumcision season has resulted in nine initiate deaths. Two initiates have died in the Amathole district, while Joe Gqabi, Sarah Baartman and OR Tambo districts have reported one death each. Four initiates died in Chris Hani. Eastern Cape traditional affairs spokesman Mamkeli Ngam suspected the initiates died of dehydration. “We’re still waiting for post mortem results.” The deaths happened mostly in legal amabhuma. Thirteen initiates were rescued in Mbizana and are being housed in a rescue centre. Traditional Affairs MEC Xolile Nqata called on district forums to do assessments to strengthen areas of weakness and improve rapid response time. Mzwabantu Ngqina (46) told Daily Sun no initiates should lose their lives. “But there are ingcibi who don’t want to learn about this custom.” He said initiates must not have sex before they’re completely healed. “They must not be visited by their girlfriends and must not be allowed to cross rivers while their wounds are still fresh,” he said. “There are ingcibi who beat abakhwetha. “It’s said that they’re beaten so they can handle adult problems. “There’s no such thing. People who beat abakhwetha must be arrested.” Mzwabantu said abakhwetha must drink water. “Most of these initiate deaths are caused by dehydration,” he said. “In the past, abakhwetha used to get a limited quantity of water for a certain time. But government doesn’t allow that.” Meanwhile, Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders chairman Mwelo Nonkonyana called for   police interventions.
