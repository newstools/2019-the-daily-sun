streets are waterlogged and residents have been struggling to get around. While most people see rain as a blessing and an end to the drought, residents of Bochabela in Mangaung see it as a nightmare. Their unfinished gravel roads get muddy and slippery as soon as the heavens open up. READ: OVER 700 FAMILIES WITHOUT SHELTER Mantuli Motsamai (43) told Daily Sun residents asked the municipality to have their roads tarred but it didn’t respond. “All our roads are in a terrible state,” she said. “On rainy days it’s tough for drivers, and even for those of us who walk, as the gravel road gets muddy and slippery. “Most people ekasi don’t go anywhere on rainy days.” She said contractors started working earlier this year before the elections. “We were happy as we thought in December we’d walk on paved roads during the festive season, but it was just a dream. “Instead of walking on the paving, we’re stuck in a pool of water.” Mantuli said she was worried they were not going to enjoy Christmas if it continued to rain. Another resident, Papi Mosela (39), said the gravel road damaged his car. “There’s no alternative road to use. We’re forced to drive on the muddy gravel roads, which are all in terrible condition and full of water.” He said the terrible roads were also littered with potholes. Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: “I promise residents their problem will be attended to soon.”
