THE commitment of Bidvest Wits towards continental football remains under question. Could it be that they prefer to focus on domestic challenges than to worry themselves about continental recognition? Perhaps the answer lies in their poor finishing, as seen when they were held to a goalless draw by little-known Al Nasr in their Caf Confederation Cup at Dobsonville Stadium last night. But after last night’s performance, there can be doubting coach Gavin Hunt’s dedication towards Confederation Cup. His Students simply didn’t show a willingness to win a game they could have won at a canter. The draw leaves the Students bottom of the group C with two points, five adrift of log leaders Horoya, who beat Djioloba 1-0 in the other match. There are three fixtures left for Wits, but on their half-hearted display it is hard to predict where they will finish in the group. The home side have now lost one and drawn two. And after last night, it wasn’t hard to figure out why. Wits utterly dominated the match, however, reaped no reward for their efforts due, mainly to poor finishing. Molahlehi Khunyedi really looked lost as he squandered two great opportunities. His senior Gift Motupa could no do any better with a perfect opportunity on the stroke of halftime. The Libyans looked like a team whose fate in the group has already been determined. They posed no threat up front, were poor in the middle and porous at the back. It was a stronger line-up Hunt put out, showing intent to change the perception that Caf football is nothing but an inconvenience to him. Chances went begging, when missing looked much easier than scoring. Even Mxolisi Machupu couldn’t find the target with the last chance of the match. The look on Hunt’s face mirrored the disappointment felt by every Wits player. They know the mountain they have to climb to secure one of the two spots in the group and seal a place in the quarterfinals.
