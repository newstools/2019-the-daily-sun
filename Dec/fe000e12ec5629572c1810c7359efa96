A day after their daughterâ€™s death, her parents, called
for 'global prayer' to resurrect her. Olive Alayne Heiligenthal (2) died early December 14 in
northern California. She stopped breathing in her sleep and was declared dead
at a hospital. Her parents, Andrew and Kalley Heiligenthal, found
support from their congregation at Bethel Redding mega church.  Daily Mail reports that the devout Christian couple had hoped
that their dead, two-year-old daughter could be resurrected through faith and
prayer. They called for prayers but have now decided to move
forward with funeral arrangements. The day after Olive's death, her mother wrote a
heartbreaking post on Instagram, calling for 'bold, unified prayers from the
global church to stand with us in belief that He will raise this little girl
back to life'. But a Bethel Redding church spokesperson said in a
statement Friday: 'Over the past week, the Bethel Church community, both local
and global, has come together at the request of Andrew and Kalley Heiligenthal
to pray for [Olive's] resurrection. 'At this time, the family has chosen to move towards a memorial service
for Olive,' the statement read, noting that the family is 'incredibly thankful
for the prayers and support that the community has shown as they and thousands
of people have been believing for a miracle.'
