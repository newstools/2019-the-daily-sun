RUBBISH mafias have taken over the dump sites. And if you want to collect you have to pay R20 to go in and R300 a week. On Friday, a rubbish collector was killed at Rietfontein dump site in KwaThema in Ekurhuleni. “He was refused entry because he didn’t want to pay R20,” said Jacob Nkomo (30). “I work here in Rietfontein. The situation here is bad. We die for this rubbish.”  Johanna Ngobeni (47) said she was there to work for her children. “I’ve been doing this for many years. Why should I pay money to someone else? I’ll rather die,” she said. Collectors said the Rietfontein dump site was lucrative as private companies dumped there. “We find nice things. That is why the gangs are fighting to take control,” said Johanna. Daily Sun visited the Rietfontein site and saw private companies coming in to dump their waste.  In June , four people were killed at the Rietfontein site over rubbish. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said five people were arrested over the killings.  Police confirmed a rubbish collector was killed last Friday at the dump site in KwaThema. Solly Mashabela, spokesman for the Ekurhuleni Municipality, said he was not aware of the gangs operating at dump sites.
