Modern arts can be confusing, this work of art by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan titled “Comedian” was sold to a French collector for $120,000 (R1.7 million). The controversial piece, that some described as sarcastic, and some called it an insult to art, is a Banan aduct-taped to teh wall. Italian artist who had also entertained art lovers from around the globe in 2017 with his "America" 18-carat-gold toilet, is known for his unconventional work. Things took a turn when New York-based performance artist David Datuna shook the crowd, he grabbed and ate the banana around 1:45 p.m. on Saturday in front of a convention full of art lovers, and was later escorted out of the art gallery. He called the act, a'hungry artist' perfomance. A replacement banana was taped to the wall about 15 minutes after Datuna’s stunt. “Hungry Artist” Art performance by me ??
