THE LIFE of late Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa has been captured in a book called Decoding 666_9: The Inexplicable Life Of Senzo Meyiwa, self-published by author Soweto Mandlanzi. “The book has two climaxes. The first was when he met and dated Kelly Khumalo,” said Soweto.

There are segments that were actually written by him. The book had Sam’s blessing,” Soweto revealed. The author said Senzo was the sole breadwinner at his home. “After his death life became difficult. All the proceeds of this book will go to his family, ideally to his wife and kids,” said Soweto.

It was discussed with my father and he gave his approval.” He said he didn’t know the book was already in the shops. “We were hoping to do a launch. The money will be used to buy a tombstone for Senzo and maintain his children.” The book was released on Monday and is available for purchase from the Author.
