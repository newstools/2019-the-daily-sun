ERNST Middendorp does not have an opinion on Orlando Pirates new head coach Josef Zinnbauer. And this is simply because the outspoken Kaizer Chiefs mentor knows his countryman only “by name”. Zinnbauer’s appointment to the Bucs hotseat has divided opinion among the Bucs faithful. In fact, some have already passed verdict on the 49-year-old before he could even have his first training session. “I know him by name. You must understand he is nearly 20 years younger. And I left Germany many years ago,” said Middendorp. “Of course, it’s not that you have to be able to understand someone to know their coaching. “Give him a clear chance. Give him an opportunity to manage the team adequately. And that’s it. I have no obligation to wish him all the best, assess or make comments on him.” Middendorp added that coaches are global players and that it doesn’t really matter if a coach is South African or German. “Coaches in South Africa can coach in other countries. There is no stopping them from going to other countries,” he said. “I’m convinced SA coaches will coach in other leagues. It’s normal procedure. There’s nothing stopping qualified SA coaches from going to other countries.”
