The time for sharing and giving is here and all over Mzansi, the less fortunate are receiving food parcels. On Tuesday, Bushbuckridge mayor Sylvia Nxumalo handed over groceries to several families in ward 4, Marite outside Hazyview. Nxumalo said everything was made possible by the sponsors who came on board to put a smile of other people’s faces. “We are thankful to these wonderful sponsors the Ntlemo Foundation, Phalaborwa Mining Company and Baiton paving who supported this initiative with these beautiful Christmas gifts for you to enjoy with your families.” She said they will continue handing out gifts throughout the season. In Madras Village, health MEC and ANC spokeswoman Sasekani Manzini handed over food parcels. “Today, we have brought you these food parcels so you can enjoy Christmas too. So, be safe and crossover happily next week,” said Manzini. Vahluri Foundation, led by its founder Victor Kubayi, could not be left behind. They also donated some goodies to 20 families in Thulamahashe. The 29-year-old said he felt like giving to the needy families after realising they had nothing for Christmas. “I have spent R20 000 for the grocery and clothes. I have been doing this for the past ten years.” He said this initiative was started last year to ensure that no one starves during this season. One of the recipients Lovey Mnisi said: “We are grateful about these wonderful gifts. We had nothing for Christmas but now we will be able to eat.”
