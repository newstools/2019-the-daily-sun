ZIMKHITHA Patso (31) was a happy woman when she found her hijacked car last week. Zimkitha from Gugulethu, Cape Town, was hijacked while at church on 15 November! “The thugs came inside the church and robbed us of our belongings before driving away in my car,” she said. Zimkhitha said when the incident happened, there were six people in the church. “I’m happy my car is back and I thank God because not everyone gets their stolen car back in one piece,” she said. Zimkhitha said after she posted her car’s details on social media and her story was published in Daily Sun, she received a message from someone who said they had seen it in Browns Farm, not far from the church. She asked the person to send her a photo. “I didn’t want to celebrate without seeing the photo. The criminals changed the registration number, but I could see it was my car,” she said. Zimkhitha, accompanied by cops, went looking for her car and found it parked next to a yard. “People living there said they knew nothing about the car. They just woke up to find it parked there,” said Zimkhitha. She was praying for the thugs who took her car to change their ways and repent. “They need God. You can’t just take what people worked hard for. What’s even worse is that they robbed people in a church.”
