MASKANDI star Khuzani “King Khuba” Mpungose vowed to give his best at Mr and Miss Indoni Cultural SA. The event takes place at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Convention Centre tonight. Earlier this year, Khuzani made history when he became the first maskandi artist to fill up the Moses Mabhida Stadium. He said he’d paint the convention centre blue. The Elika Khuba hitmaker said he’d use the stage to perform his new hit songs. “I’ll use this opportunity to perform my new hit songs including Isilingo, Tsotsi, uKhuba Wethu and Gcwensa neBhova. “This will also give me an opportunity to show my fans that I appreciate their support,” Khuzani said. The competition would see 12 girls and 12 boys from different cultural background competing for Mr and Miss Indoni Cultural SA. People from cultural groups such as Ndebele, Swati, Tswana, Tsonga, Pedi, Venda, Khoisan, Sotho, Xhosa, Mpondo, Thembu and Zulu would perform. According to the organisers, the contestants hadspent a week together in Durban. The aim was to help establish good relations between different cultural groups. Indoni founder Dr Nomcebo Mthembu told SunBuzz: “We’re excited to announce that for the first time since 2012, boys from 12 participating cultural groups will compete for the same perks as their female counterparts, which will challenge boys to display and demonstrate what they’ve learnt from Indoni during and after winter schools,” said Mthembu. Tickets are available at Webtickets and Pick n Pay for R250 general and R450 VIP.
