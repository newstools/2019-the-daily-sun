PEOPLE are in a holiday mood and the sun also came out to
play. Many north coast people spent their Christmas day with their
family at Alkanstrand beach in Richards Bay. One of the beachgoers, Nozipho Dlamini (25), said they don’t
celebrate Christmas as the birth of Jesus but they treat it as family day. “It our tradition. 
Every year we come here to celebrate,” said Nozipho. Bhekumuzi Hlatshwayo (54) said they started their day at
church and now they came to the beach to have fun family time out. “This is a day to be together and spend time with family and
we will leave here very late,” said Bhekumuzi. UMhlathuze Municipality mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo wishes all the
visitors a happy and safe holidays. “We know more numbers will be coming to our city to spend
holidays.  We wish them a merry Christmas
and a happy new year,” said Mhlongo.
