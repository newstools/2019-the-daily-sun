THE 26-YEAR-OLD suspect who allegedly killed his girlfriend, Cebisile Luphondwe (15), will be kept in jail. The suspect, who abandoned bail last month, appeared in the Glencoe Magistrates Court yesterday where his case was postponed to 21 January. Prosecutor Zweli Mhlophe told the suspect his case was postponed for further investigation and DNA results. The suspect was bust on 11 November after he led the cops to the scne where he dumped and burnt Cebisile’s body. She had been missing for three weeks. Her madala, Joseph Buthelezi (78), was happy the suspect would spend Christmas without his family. “What he did to us was very painful and we’ll never forgive him. We believe the law will take its course,” he said. “I hope they give him a sentence that will set an example to other abusers. If abusers and killers get light sentences, they come back to society and continue with their bad behaviour,” he said. Joseph said he hoped the suspect would be convicted and sentenced to life in jail. He said such people didn’t deserve to live with the rest of society. “Our wound will forever be open because we were expecting our child to achieve a lot in life as she was still young.” Joseph said although the suspect had sang in previous court appearance, yesterday he was quiet.
