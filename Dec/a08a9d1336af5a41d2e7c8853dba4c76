CAPE Town City are moving swiftly to ring the changes to avoid potential disaster in the league’s second round. Bottom of the Premiership table, winless in five matches and low on morale, the Citizens have really hit rock bottom. Despite the arrival of new coach Olde Riekerink, City are battling to shake off the early season slump, so much so that they are now joint at the bottom of the log with Polokwane City on 13 points. But wily old fox John Comitis is ready to splash the cash in the upcoming transfer window and strengthen the squad. Several players, including Giannis Potouridis and Travis Graham are set to be loaned out as the Citizens boss looks to open up space for new recruits. Roland Putsche has also battled for game time under Riekerink, the Austrian having not played in the last three games. Comitis has had success with the recruitment of foreign players, who are mostly from European countries. This season, though, it doesn’t look like he has hit the jackpot. A poor run of results has already led to the sacking of coach Benni McCarthy, but Comitis has insisted the decision is already bearing fruits. “There are a lot of things that he (Riekerink) has brought to the team already. It’s been exciting to see him at work,” said Comitis. “The intensity has increased. We’ve doubled up at training sessions. a lot has changed in a short time without changing much on the pitch though because he wants to let the players to express themselves.” For the past two seasons, the Citizens have been pretty consistent, maintaining their spot in the top-eight and challenging for honours in knockout competitions. But it appears they will have to show character they once displayed under Eric Tinkler to lift themselves out of the mire.
