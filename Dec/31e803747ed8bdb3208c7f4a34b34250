A WAR over land is brewing between Clayville residents and members of Charis Missionary Church. The residents said there were seven churches in their area and they didn’t need a new one. They said they wanted libraries, a bigger police station, a youth recreational centre, a high school or playgrounds, but not a “noisy” church. This after church members came to Clayville on Thursday to clean the land for their church. But residents told Daily Sun they were not consulted.  Resident Mohau Moloi (41) said he won’t allow church members to invade their community. “We will sit here until the City of Ekurhuleni does something. They don’t even have documentation to show that the land belongs to them. “We live in suburbs to avoid such. We won’t allow this,” said Mohau. Another resident, Khutso Masha (28), claimed when they tried to talk to the church leader, they were told they would hire hitmen for them. “These are church people, but they know nothing about peace. They didn’t even negotiate with us, all they do is threaten us. We definitely don’t need these kind of people in our community,” said Khutso. When Daily Sun tried to speak to the leader of the church, he dismissed the SunTeam. But on Friday, the church shared a post on Facebook: “This is an update of the new Charis premises as the ministry plans to relocate due to some challenges with the current location, such as having outgrown its place of fellowship and a lack of parking for cars.” City of Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said the matter was reported and the municipality was looking into it.
