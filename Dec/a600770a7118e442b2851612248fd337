ORLANDO Pirates new coach Josef Zinnbauer started his tenure on a positive note collecting maximum points against Black Leopards at Orlando Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The German mentor took over the reins from Rulani Mokwena who was in charge of the club on a caretaker basis since the departure of Milutin Sredojevic. Zinnbauer was on the Bucs bench for the first time alongside his assistant Mokwena and Fadlu Davids when the club beat Leopards 3-1 at Orlando Stadium. Innocent Maela goal in the first half and Ghabadinho Mhangoâ€™s brace in the second stanza ensured that the Buccaneers welcome the new coach with three points. Pirates have now won five matches in the league while playing five draws and losing four fixtures. In other Absa Premiership matches played on Saturday afternoon, Highlands Park defeated Golden Arrows 2-0 at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa. Baroka suffered a slight 1-0 defeat in hands of Stellenbosch FC in Polokwane. These were the last league matches for the teams as they are going to Christmas break.
