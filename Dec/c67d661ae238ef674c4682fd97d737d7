STELLENBOSCH FC have confirmed contract termination of Junior Awono and Dickson Afoakwa. The duo failed to impress and break it into coach Steve Barker's line-up. The club which is currently rooted at the bottom of the Absa premiership table with 12 points after 14 matches confirmed the news with a statement on Wednesdayt. The statement said: "Stellenbosch FC has terminated by mutual agreement the contracts of midfielder Junior Awono and forward Dickson Afoakwa. "Dickson signed at the beginning of the current 2019/20 season and has not been able to force his way into a regular first-team place. "Junior was one of the stalwarts of the historic SFC championship-winning team in the NFD last season. He has been plagued by injuries this season though and is looking to secure more regular match time at his next club. "Junior has left a legacy at the club with this unrivalled professionalism and dedication, culminating in winning the prestigious Players' Player of the Year Award last season. "The club sincerely thanks both Junior and Dickson for their service to SFC and wishes them the very best with their careers going forward." On Saturday the PSL newbies will play their last match of the second round when they visit Baroka FC at Peter Mokaba Stadium (3.30pm).
