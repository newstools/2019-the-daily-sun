I WISH my granddad was still alive to witness some of the fruit of his sacrifices. These were the words of Nosipho Hani Khumalo, the granddaughter of the late struggle icon Chris Hani. She told Daily Sun she’d one day love to be involved in politics and become a leader. She said leadership ran in the family. “I’m doing my best to uphold the Hani legacy. And my family members are happy with my achievements.” The 21-year-old third-year medical student at Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in Tshwane was all smiles after she was recently elected as the first female president of University Sports South Africa. She said the organisation was formed in 2008. “I love sport and played as a striker and captained Germiston Ladies Football Team, which is in the regional league,” she said. She now plays table tennis at the university. Nosipho said her goal was to get a financial injection and sponsors for the organisation. She said the organisation catered for all sporting codes in the country and all tertiary institutions were welcome to join. “My ambition is to uplift the youth academically and in sports,” she said. “People respect me and are happy to have a black female leader, which shows growth and development since 1994.”
