HOUSE DJ and producer Facebuk wants to end the year on a high note. The musician, whose real name is Kwazikakhe Zungu (28), from Ulundi, KZN, said his latest single, Tears Of Pain, was the one to listen to this season. The single was released last month. “It’s all about love and connection. I love putting smiles on the faces of those who go through a lot in their lives,” he told SunBuzz. DJ Facebuk, who grew up looking up to his idol DJ Black Coffee, said his music career started when he was only 16 years old. “I was inspired by Euphonik and Black Coffee. At every event I was invited to, I knew I had to improve to reach their level,” he said. DJ Facebuk released his debut single Buyani last April. The song was followed by Bu Izimzimu four months later. In 2017 he started his annual one-man show called DJ Facebuk-Kwazi All White Event. The show aimed to celebrate top achievers at schools and tertiary institutions around his home town. During the shows, held both on and off campuses, he had shared the stage with up-and-coming DJs and rappers. “I know how to host people and events are my favourite things. People love fun, so we need to deliver as entertainers,” he said. The musician said people had been showing him nothing but love since he embarked on his musical journey. DJ Facebuk had performed at big events and venues such as Eyadini Lounge, Mgungundlovu Picnic, Durban Picnic and uMhlathuze Music Festival. He had performed alongside industry giants such as Black Coffee, DJ Tira, Zakes Bantwini and DJ Sox. DJ Facebuk had also played sets for radio stations Ukhozi, Gagasi and Zululand FM. “I’d love to work with Black Coffee and David Guetta.They make good sounds and their work is amazingly done,” he said.
