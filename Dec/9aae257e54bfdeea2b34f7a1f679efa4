Sydney, Australia - A 12-YEAR-OLD boy and his dog escaped a fire approaching his family’s farmhouse by grabbing the keys to his brother’s truck and driving to safety. Lucas Sturrock was home alone on Sunday after his dad and brother went to fight a fire in Mogumber, 128km northwest of Perth, western Australia, when the blaze approached his house. Realising the fire was approaching too fast to escape to the point designated by his dad, Lucas grabbed the family dog and headed off in his older brother’s truck, police said. Emergency workers found Lucas and the dog in the truck on the side of the road unharmed. “It was great he had the driving skills to get out of there,” police Sergeant Michael Daley told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “It’s fantastic we found him and got him out of danger.” Ivan Sturrock, Lucas’ father, said his son had learnt to drive when he was seven. “We taught him to drive since he was about seven, just in case things like this do happen and I was quite proud of him. He did exactly what we told him to do,” Ivan told the ABC. Lucas is one of thousands of Australians who’ve been forced to flee their homes amid a devastating national bushfire crisis that has seen authorities struggle to contain hundreds of blazes. The fires have killed six people, destroyed more than 680 homes and burnt about 1,2 million hectares of bushland. Conditions are expected to deteriorate this week. – REUTERS
