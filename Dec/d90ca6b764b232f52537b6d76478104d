MEET Portia Lebona from Klipspruit extension 2, Soweto. She drives a silver grey 2016 VW Polo Vivo. Q: When did you buy your car? A: I bought my car in 2016 and named it Delicious because it is smart and runs smoothly on the road. Q: Is it your first car? A: My third car. I have been driving my car for the past three years now. I have been taking good care of it and it has never disappointed me, not even once. Q: Why do you love it so much? A: It is good on petrol and very ghetto just like me. Q: Tell us what you like about this car? A: VW is a brand I’ve liked since childhood. My other two cars were also the same brand. Q: Would you allow another person to drive it? A: My dad is allowed to drive my car. Q: Have you taken a long distance trip in your car? A: Yes, to Mpumalanga and Rustenburg. Q: Tell us about your choice of colour? A: Silver grey is a unique colour and mostly loved by women. The car looks even more stylish if it has tinted windows. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I do not have traffic fines. Q: What do you think of other drivers? A: We are different drivers on the road. But I’m not happy about people who drive in the emergency lane when they are not in a hurry and those who drive under the influence of alcohol. I want others to also put on the safety belt while driving in case something happens.
