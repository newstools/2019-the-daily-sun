THE seven friends were on their way to the swimming pool when their day of fun turned into a horrific experience. They were stuffed into the carriages of a goods train by thugs. One of them jumped to his death trying to escape! The boys were found by security guards in Tshwane and were returned to their families in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, on Monday.  One of the boys (16) told Daily Sun after they were put into the train, his friend, Lebogang Jiyane (17), jumped out but hit his head on the ground and died. His body was found by guards on Sunday night.  The nightmare started on Sunday when they were accosted by two thugs. The 16-year-old said: “They pointed guns at us and took R50 and two cellphones. They told us to get into a train that had stopped at an intersection. When the train pulled off, Lebogang jumped out. I also jumped and injured my knee.” He said he was helped by railway security guards and taken to a local clinic. The other boys were found in the train by guards at a station in Tshwane. They took them to the local police station and cops took them home. Gogo Daisy Thabethe said Lebogang was a respectful child and his mum was devastated. An inquest docket was opened at Etwatwa Police Station.
