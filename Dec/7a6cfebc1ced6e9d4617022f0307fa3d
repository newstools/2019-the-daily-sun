KUTLWANO Mofokeng (36) was once a tiger in bed. But he’s done with long-term relationships and wants a simple poke-and-go. Except for one thing. . . Kutlwano’s 4-5 is magosha shy.

His former girlfriend of six years apparently broke his heart after cheating on him. “I was so depressed I locked myself in my room all the time,” he said. The 36-year-old from Orange Farm said: “I don’t mean to brag, but from what women tell me I’m good in bed.” And so it came to pass that Kutlwano found a shoulder to cry on with magoshas. Or so he thought. “I didn’t want anyone to tell me what to do with my life,” he said. On a visit to Jozi, he found a magosha and paid her R50. But his 4-5 let him down. “The woman did everything but nothing happened,” he said. Kutlwano said he went back a week later, but still there was no action. Two years ago he found a new girl with whom he had great sex, but after they broke up he went back to his old ways but still couldn’t poke. Magosha Nozipho Mthethwa (36) said he came to her twice but failed both times. READ: PICS: BOYFRIEND VS BEN 10! “I tried everything but his 4-5 never worked. He paid me without getting a poke.” Daily Sun spoke to Kutlwano’s ex, Londiwe Thabede (31), who said they had many problems but poking was never one of them. “I hope he finds help,” she said. His most recent ex, Zodwa Dladla (34), said: “This is crazy! This man can get any woman he wants.”
