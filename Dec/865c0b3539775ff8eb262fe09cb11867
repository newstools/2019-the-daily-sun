THE MAN accused of killing Precious Ramabulana is expected to
appear in the Morebeng Magistrates Court on Monday. Ahead of his appearance, fellow students and local
residents from Botlokwa sang and chanted outside court premises.  They were holding placards demanding that he shouldn't be
given any bail. Reginald Mobe, EFF's student activist said that Precious
was one of their own and that's why they came to court to see her ‘murderer’. "This man must be treated the same way he treated
Precious. He doesn't deserve no mercy. We wish that the court can give him a
bail so that we can deal with him outside," he said.
