An unroadworthy minibus taxi, was taken off the road by Police minister Bheki Cele. Cele labelled the taxi “a coffin on wheels”. This was during the monitoring of the safer festive season campaign on the N4 road in Mpumalanga on Tuesday (17 December). Cele said the taxi cannot continue to travel as it was not safe for the passengers and other road users. "This is a coffin on the wheels. This is not roadworthy; you want us to bury people on the 25th? You will not make it to Jozi, you are going to the grave," he told the driver. The taxi had broken seats, the wheels and engine were not in a good condition. A passenger, Mpho Sello (38) said everything in the taxi was falling apart. "This is very bad because should we get an accident we are not going to survive in this taxi, no one is going to survive," she said.  Sello said before they boarded the taxi, they complained to the driver about its condition, but he just instead he gave them a ‘toilet paper’ to clean the seats. Mpumalanga is the first province Cele visited since the launch of the safer festive season campaign. He said he will be going to other provinces. "I am fine with the progress so far; we are not going to arrest criminals if they are not on the road. For the fact that we have arrested people now, this means that there are less criminals on the road. But that does not mean we must get discouraged; we must stay here until we arrest everybody we need. We must make our communities safe," he said. A number of police have been dispatched around the country, working with other law enforcement agencies to fight crime during the festive season.
