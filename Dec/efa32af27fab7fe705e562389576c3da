POLITICIANS in the Abaqulusi Municipality in northern KZN have welcomed the arrest of speaker Mkhonyovu Khumalo. He was bust on Thursday along with disaster manager Sizwe Mthembu while chairing a council meeting. They appeared in the Vryheid Magistrates Court the next day and were released on R2 000 bail. The matter was postponed to 24 February. Khumalo (47) and Mthembu (45) of the IFP were accused of stealing a municipal generator. It went missing in 2017 and police found it at Khumalo’s house in KwaCeza near Ulundi. ANC regional secretary, Zakes Buthelezi welcomed the arrests. “We’re calling on the speaker to do the honourable thing and step down from his position,” he told the People’s Paper. DA leader in Zululand, Sbu Nkoso, said the law should take its course. A senior IFP member in the municipality said the area where Khumalo lived had no electricity. He alleged took the generator while preparing for his brother’s burial without the municipality’s knowledge. IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala said the party would wait for the court process to unfold.
