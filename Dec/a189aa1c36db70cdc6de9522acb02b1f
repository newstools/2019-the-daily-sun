THEY had worked hard all year. Now all their efforts have gone up in smoke! About 44 people were travelling from Cape Town to Zimbabwe when their bus caught fire on the N1 free in Joburg yesterday, leaving all their luggage in ashes. In a video circulating on social media, a woman crying hysterically said she had worked very hard the whole year to make her family back in Zimbabwe happy during the festive season. “We deprive ourselves when we’re here. We prefer working hard because that’s why we left our families in the first place. What will I tell my children? I bought food and clothes for them. Now all of that is gone,” she said.  Joyce Sibanda (32), who was travelling with her two kids, said she had no words to describe the loss. “All my kids’ clothes were in the bus. I don’t even know if I still want to go home,” she said. A witness said it was heartbreaking to watch the women and kids looking hopeless on the side of the road.        “One of the women told me she rented a shack for R350 and ate chicken and veggies for the whole year to save up for her family. She said she had groceries and clothes worth R6 000 from the money she made from selling vegetables and peanuts,” said the witness. JMPD spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said one of the bus’ front tyres burst, causing it to catch fire. Transport department’s Ayanda Allie Paine said it was a relief no passengers died. “But the passengers lost everything they had saved up for and bought for their families.”
