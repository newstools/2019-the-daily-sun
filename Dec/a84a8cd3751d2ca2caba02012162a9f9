MOTSWEDINGFM’s troubled station manager Katlego Mokhele was shown the door. Mokhele was fired from his position on Wednesday after a lengthy disciplinary process, following allegations of fraud and misconduct. He was the subject of a controversy after allegations that his girlfriend irregularly benefited from SABC resources, including a catering tender for the station’s 54th birthday celebration in 2016 at the Sun City Resort, North West. He was also accused of forging documents and spending the public broadcaster’s funds irregularly.

Protesters also accused him of hiring non-Setswana speakers as presenters. SABC spokesperson, Mmoni Seapolelo, confirmed Mokhemi’s dismissal but remained coy on the disciplinary processes. He said: “The SABC can confirm the dismissal of MotswedingFM’s station manager Mr Katlego Mokhele following a disciplinary hearing. “But we won’t be able to discuss the matter further due to the employer/employee confidentiality relationship.” Katlego was not available for comment. He also ignored our WhatsApp messages and SMSes.
