THE grocery vouchers always came at a good time. But this time, just before Christmas, the timing couldn’t have been better! When the SunTeam delivered the R2 500 vouchers to gogo Magdalene Sethosa (71) at her home in Ga-Makgakga, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, she sang and thanked God. “This is so amazing. I’ve been entering the competition for many years and the win has come at the perfect time,” she said. “My grandchildren and their parents will be coming over to celebrate Christmas and I’ll buy enough food to spoil them.” Magdalene, a retired teacher, said she’d save some vouchers for January. The first-time winner said she was a number one fan of Daily Sun in her area. “My late brother Billy, who died in 2011, is the one who inspired me to read the People’s Paper,” she said. “He brought it home every day after work and would hand it over to me to read. “I love to read front page stories all the way through to the sport stories. My son buys it for me these days.”
