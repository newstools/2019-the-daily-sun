OUTGOING Polokwane City interim coach Bernard Molekwa has given club boss Johnny Mogalagadi a thumbs up for hiring new head coach Clinton Larsen. Larsen was appointed City new mentor last Thursday to succeed Zlatko Krmpotic, who was sacked last month due to a string of poor results. Molekwa was in charge of Rise and Shine for the last time in their 1-0 league defeat to Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership match played at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday. “Larsen is an experienced coach who knows our football well,” said Molekwa. “The club did well to hire him. He could have been on the bench on Sunday, but he wanted me to continue as he joined us later on Thursday and he did not have enough time to prepare the team. I am positive that he is the right man to help the team turn the corner.” Molekwa is likely to work with Larsen as his deputy. The former Chippa United coach has joined a team that suffered eight successive league defeats and are third bottom on the log table. The Limpopo-based side are only a point ahead of bottom side Stellenbosch FC. City haven’t tasted victory for the past two months. The last time they won a match was on 21 September when they beat SuperSport United 3-1 at Lucas Moripe Stadium. Larsen’s first game in charge will be on 21 December against defending league champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Stadium. Meanwhile, Molekwa said his side made a series of mistakes which cost them points against the Team of Choice. “We gave away three points because of mistakes. We dominate the game especially in the first half and we could have at least scored a goal. I think we also played well, but luck was also not on our side,” he said.
