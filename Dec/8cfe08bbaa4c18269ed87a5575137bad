SMALL businesses outside Nasrec Expo Centre are ‘breathing through the wound.’They came here hopeful to make a decent money from the EFF’s National People Assembly, hosted at Nasrec in Soweto. But combos didn’t communicate for the business people, who basked in the sun without making any money.Some had to sleep outside Expo Centre as they were avoiding transport costs of taking their stock from and to the conference on a daily basis until Monday.  One who slept outside is Fikile Maseko (58), left her house in Mzimhlophe in Soweto to sell food to the delegates attending the EFF conference.She sells pap, steak, chicken and variety of salads for delegates to choose from. But on the second day, no delegate has bought anything from her.“There is no business here, and I am worried that the food is going to get .  ”She said she will have to throw the food away the spoilt food, as she won’t be able to sell that to anyone.Fikile and other business people, particularly merchandisers are hopeful, but they are slowly making peace with the fact that they might not make money at Nasrec.Merchandisers, Tshepo Mphlala (23) and Lerato Diale (26) came all the way from Alex, hoping to make a killing.  Tshepo said he borrowed money to get the enough stock to sell to delegates from all corners of the country.“We are trying to make a living, and to support their wives and children.”They said they apart from not making money, they have to deal with the police who are enforcing by laws and chasing them away from the pavements. Those at Nasrec are not the only ones whose hopes were crushed. Businesses around Soweto were also anticipating some business from the fighters.But the strict arrangements they are under, is making it difficult for them to go and support the businesses out there.They are transported to from the hotel to Nasrec and straight to hotels after they are dine with the business of the day.In Vilakazi Street on Friday night, there wasn’t any red berets seen there, as well as other places around Soweto
