SNEKE Chillers are targeting a rare history at this year's Discovery Walter Sisulu Challenge. The exciting, showboating galore tournament started on Sunday and will run until 29 December where the champions will be crowned. Sneke are the defending champions. They won last year's edition beating White City Spurs FC 4-2 on penalties. The team from Snake Park in Soweto are eyeing to return their title and they have an idea of what it takes to win this unpredictable tournament again. The tournament which attracts thousands of fans from and around Soweto, as well as scouts who are looking for raw talent, is taking place at Nike Centre in Pimville. Since the tournament was established only Senoane Gunners, Trap Zone Sports and Soweto All Stars have managed to win the title back-to-back. On Sunday Sneke started their title defence quest with an impressive 5-1 thumping Zola Amagents FC. Captain of Sneke Mduduzi Mkhize who is one of the favourites said their start was just a sign of what they are about this year. However, the player admitted they will have a tricky tournament as all the teams are against them this year. ”The goal is to be one of the few teams to have defended the title,” Mkhize said. ”But it is still too early to you know. We just won our first match which sets a good tone for the tournament for us.” Last year's runners-up, White City Spurs also won their first match of this years edition 1-0 defeating Orlando Real Stars FC. With just two days in the tournament, there's still a lot of football fans can expect as teams such as Dube Continental, Soweto Super United, Dzakaroski, Gunners, La Masia and Sabelo Spurs who are some of the favourites are still going to grace the Nike Centre.
