A PRISON warder who’s accused of raping a woman has been remanded in custody. The suspect appeared in the Galeshewe Magistrates Court on Wednesday. The case was postponed to Friday for a bail application. The 38-year-old was bust on Tuesday after he allegedly raped a 20-year-old woman. The woman was apparently walking home from a local tavern when she came across the suspect. She was allegedly grabbed and dragged to a nearby veld and raped. According to patrons, the victim was with friends at the tavern but decided to leave alone when her friends wanted to stay longer. A patron said: “She went to the toilet, and a few minutes later she was woken up by the security guard, who told her she shouldn’t be sleeping in the toilets. “If I had known she’d become a victim of such a crime I’d have offered to walk her home. The suspect should rot in jail for what he did.” Police spokesman Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba said a rape suspect was arrested on Tuesday morning by members of the Galeshewe family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit. “The suspect is attached to Tswelopele Prison in Kimberley,” said Ramatseba. He allegedly raped the victim in Kagisho at about 3.45am.”
