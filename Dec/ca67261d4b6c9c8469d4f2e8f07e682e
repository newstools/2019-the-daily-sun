Some people have already started travelling to different places for their festive season holidays. Most parts of the country have congested traffic as people who work in cities leave for the rural areas. Motorists should be patient on the road to minimise road deaths and crashes. It’s safer to arrive at your destination late than to die on the road. Drinking and driving poses a serious danger to fellow motorists who obey the rules of the road. The message is clear: booze and driving don’t mix! Speed and reckless driving kill. The recent rainfall has also caused floods in most parts of the country and motorists should drive carefully. ) Rofhiwa Phaswana
