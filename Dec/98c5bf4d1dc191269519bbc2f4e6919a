BLACK LEOPARDS players are divided, following the suspension of midfielder Karabo Tshepe on Monday. An insider at Lidoda Duvha told SunSport that coach Luc Eymael stopped Tshepe from training with the club for allegedly criticising him. Two senior players, known to Sunday Sun, snitched on him and told Eymael what the player had said, which led to Tshepe’s suspension until he faces the club’s Disciplinary Committee. This has apparently affected the team’s morale and caused divisions among players. As a result, other players allegedly dragged their feet on the pitch in Port Elizabeth midweek, which led to a humiliating 3-0 league defeat to bottom side Chippa United. Said the source: “Karabo was told to stay away from training by the coach. It’s unfair because he jokingly criticised him while training last weekend and two players seem to have missed the joke and informed Eymael.” Eymael seems to have worsened the situation by allegedly confronting Tshepe in front of his teammates instead of sorting the matter out privately. Added the source: “The coach confronted Karabo about it in front of other players and told him to stop training. “A majority of players are angry that the two players are snitches and this should have been avoided. “Players always joke around, but they decided to tell the coach and this has sown division in the team.” Another source revealed that Tshepe might be fined by management as it’s a norm at Lidoda Duvha. “Karabo jokingly said the coach was crazy since he left them out of the pitch, but then shouted at them. “We don’t know what the two players said to the coach which made him angry and suspend Karabo. “He informed the player on Monday not to come to training until he has had a meeting with club boss Tshifhiwa Thidiela.” Eymael refused to comment about the incident prior to their training session on Thursday ahead of yesterday’s league clash against Golden Arrows in Thohoyandou, Venda. He said: “Don’t talk to me about that, call management.”
