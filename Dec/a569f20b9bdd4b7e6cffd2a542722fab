A man with a white beard has been arrested for allegedly
robbing a bank and throwing stolen money in the air while shouting "Merry
Christmas" to people on the street. SKY NEWS reports that David Wayne Oliver was arrested at
a nearby Starbucks in Colorado Springs after he targeted the Academy Bank,
according to a police report. The suspect had "threatened the use of a
weapon" and left the bank with an unspecified amount of money, police
said.  Local TV station KKTV quoted witness Dion Pascale as
saying Oliver went outside the bank and started throwing money "all over
the place". "He started throwing money out of the bag"
before yelling, "Merry Christmas," he was quoted as saying. Pascale said bystanders retrieved some of the cash and
returned it to the bank as Oliver walked to the Starbucks, sat down and
appeared to be waiting for police to arrest him, according to KKTV. The Denver Post quoted police as saying "thousands
of dollars" were still missing, adding there was no indication a weapon
was used in the heist.
