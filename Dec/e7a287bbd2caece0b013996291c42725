DJ STEVE is the proud owner of a mansion! The musician and businessman recently bought a house in Montana, Tshwane. Steve, whose real name is Stevens Sitsha (40), grew up in a shack in Winterveldt, north of Tshwane. He used to live with six family members in a three-roomed shack. He said he learnt to hustle as a young boy. Steve told Daily Sun he’d sometimes go to bed on an empty stomach. “Even though my dad tried by all means to feed us, it wasn’t enough for the family,” he said. Steve said he used to DJ at local clubs in his kasi and bought food with the little money he made. “Music changed my life. I’m now living big and comfortable in my mansion.” He said he ran his construction business during the day and did music at night. “It’s difficult to manage both, but passion and perseverance is the key to all.” The musician, who featured Uhuru on his song Celina, said he lived for music. He recently released a 13-track album called Sing a Song. He said kwaito legend Oskido was the man behind his success. “If it wasn’t for Oskido, I’d still be a nobody in the music industry. “He helped me to be a heavyweight in music,” he said.
