NEW Polokwane City coach Clinton Larsen is facing a monumental task of reviving Rise and Shine. The former Golden Arrows and Chippa United mentor joined the Limpopo based outfit early this week on one and half-year-deal. He replaced Zlatko Krmpotic, who was sacked early in November following a string of poor results despite having a promising start to the campaign. Larsen first task will be on Sunday when they host tricky Maritzburg United at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium (3.30pm). The coach will be hoping for a positive star and revive the club. Rise and Shine are occupying position 13 in the Absa Premiership log after 13 matches. They have gathered four victories and one draw, while losing the other eight outings.
