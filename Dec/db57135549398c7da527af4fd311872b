IT would seem not all people who go to sangomas do so for the right reasons. According to gobela Grace Ndlovu, people also consult sangomas to cause death. She said the three most common requests by people who consulted sangomas were killing their partners over money or cheating, eliminating colleagues over positions at work, and ukuthwala for quick money and wealth. She urged sangomas to stay true to their calling and not be tempted by money. “Others can’t resist the money. We have a gift and duty to heal. Sangomas should stop killing for money,” said Grace. She said evil deeds were not only performed by fake sangomas but also by good ones who couldn’t resist money. Grace became a trainee in 1983 and later a sangoma. She’s now a gobela who has trained more than 15 sangomas and healed many others. She lives in Lawley, south of Joburg. Speaking to Daily Sun, Grace said she was approached many times and offered varying amounts of money to kill people but she always said no. Ukuthwala, according to Grace, meant killing livestock or causing the death of a family member as a sacrifice to a snake. She said at times these spirits were turned into horrifying things including zombies. She said over time, more and more sacrifices would be needed to stay rich and the person would have to find another sacrifice. If not, these spirits would start haunting and tormenting people around them, including themselves. Grace said she was recently approached by a man who pleaded with her to help him with ukuthwala. “He offered me over R20 000 and the sacrifice was his family. I always chase away people with such ridiculous evil demands and I plead with all sangomas to do the same.” She said sangomas were only allowed to perform “return to the sender” known as phinda. She said this ritual was only performed when a person was killed through the use of evil practice and if relatives requested the evil spell to be returned to the person responsible.
