SOUTH Africa’s Women’s football is on the rise! For a second time in succession Banyana Banyana head coach Desiree Ellis has been short-listed for the Caf Women’s Coach of the Year. Star striker Thembi Kgatlana is also in line for the best player award for the third time in a row. The awards ceremony is scheduled for 7 January in Hurghada‚ Egypt. In the Coach of the Year category, Ellis is up against former Nigeria coach Thomas Dennerby‚ who left the association under a cloud following the World Cup‚ and Cameroon coach Alain Djeumfa. Kgatlana is up against Nigeria’s Asisat Oshoala who plays for Barcelona and Cameroon forward Njoya Ajara for the Player of the Year award. On her nomination, Ellis gave credit to teamwork saying that without the effort of her players and other technical members they would not be vying for these accolades. Ellis said: “It is always great to be recognised, it shows that we are on the right track. “I can be the one who gets the nomination, but credit goes to the team. We have worked very hard despite not achieving some of the targets that we set for ourselves.” The women’s awards are dominated by South Africa, Nigeria and Cameroon‚ as these three countries are also in contention for the Women’s Team of the Year prize. In 2018 Ellis and Kgatlana won the Coach and Player of the Year awards respectively as Banyana finished runners-up at the African Women’s Championship and qualified for their first-ever Fifa Women’s World Cup. Kgatlana became the second SA player to win this accolade after 10 years following Noko Matlou who won it in 2008. This year, Kgatlana scored Banyana’s first-ever World Cup goal in France. She also had a stellar season with her Chinese side Beijing BG Phoenix where she scored six goals in nine appearances.
