JOBS are scarce for everyone. It’s even more difficult for people living with disabilities to find work. Instead of feeling pity for himself, Anda Mthulu (33) from Khayelitsha, Cape Town, started Exclusive Shoe Shine and Services in 2010. It’s a shoe cleaning business. The company, which was registered in 2016, now has six male and one female partners. “We’re all disabled and we told ourselves we won’t let our disabilities stop us from living our lives,” said Anda. Their business operates from Mutual Park in Pinelands. “We charge between R35 and R75. We clean our customers’ shoes inside and outside,” said Anda. He became disabled after he was shot during a robbery in Khayelitsha. “I was walking towards the mall and found myself at a wrong place at a wrong time,” he said. Masixole Mawonga (29) said: “People need to stop being picky because there aren’t any jobs.” He said the business provided a service to people who didn’t have time to clean their shoes. “They bring any type of shoe to us and we make them look like new,” said Masixole, who was wheelchair-bound after a stabbing incident in 2008. He said people living with disabilities needed to use their God-given talents. “If your hands are functioning, there’s nothing you can’t do.”
