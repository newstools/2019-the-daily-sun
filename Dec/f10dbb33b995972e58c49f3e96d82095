AMAZULU are going to back to Umlazi’s King Zwelithini Stadium for the first time since September in a desperate need for points. Usuthu, who are second bottom with 11 points from 12 games, will host Telkom Knockout finalists and provincial rivals Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership clash there on Sunday (3.3pm). They have not played at the Umlazi venue since losing controversially to Kaizer Chiefs on the 2 September. It was also the first game for new coach Jozef Vukusic. Their next three home games were played at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium and Vukusic is looking for a different outcome from that Chiefs horror show. Recently signed Tsepo Masilela said they have “no choice” but to beat Maritzburg because the gap between themselves and bottom placed Chippa United has been narrowed to one point. “When you are down there, the goal is to get three points,” said Masilela, who has been on the losing side in his two appearances for the club. “Being down there is a challenge. But I’m the sort of player who does not shy away from challenges. I do believe that we’ll do it as a team.” The Team of Choice’s slumped to a disappointing 2-0 league loss at home SuperSport United on Wednesday. And Masilela is hoping that United are still feeling the strain from the energy sapping effort they put into beating Amakhosi in the TKO semi-final. But the 34-year-old defender concedes Maritzburg are not an easy side to play against as they have also dominated the KZN derby in recent years. “They can run. They have been working with the same coach since last season,” said Masilela, who signed a short term contract earlier this month. “They have been doing well. They are in the TKO final. But we are in the situation where we need points.”
