THE issue
of killing women is a personal one. These were
the words of EFF President and CIC, Julius Malema, when he was addressing
delegates to the party’s second National People’s Assembly in Nasrec, Soweto,
on Monday. He said:
“Please, let us find it in our hearts not to abuse or kill women. Are we really
those animals that whites describe us as? There’s nothing women can do about
abuse because they don’t abuse themselves. “The issue
of abusing women is in our DNA. Some who talk loud about abuse allow it in
their churches. If you argue with scriptures (which say women are inferior to
men), you are told that you are arguing with God. Churches that separate men
and women are discriminating. They must also be called out. There are no holy
cows here.” He said it
was unfair that President Cyril Ramaphosa was stopped from going to Given
Mkhari’s TV show, because Mkhari was accused of woman abuse. “They never
stopped Cyril from going to the Shembe church. They never stopped Cyril from
going to the ZCC. Those who have never gone to churches that separate women and
men, did not say anything. These churches separate women from men inside,”
Malema charged. He also
asked why people were not rising up against the barbaric culture of ukuthwala. The CIC
said: “Why are we not rising up against those who commit the crime of
ukuthwala? Let young girls marry who they choose to marry. What if the girl
wants to marry someone with a six pack, rather than a big old man with a big
mkhaba? Let us in the EFF punish those who undermine women in the EFF.” He also
said people should be responsible in the matter of HIV/Aids. He said there are
more cases of the virus because people do not want to be responsible. He said:
“The children must not engage in sex. Because they are still young. Be faithful
to your partners if you are married. We should also not isolate those who are
HIV positive.”
