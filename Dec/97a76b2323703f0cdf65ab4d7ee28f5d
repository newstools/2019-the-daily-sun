PASTOR Andy Masiye said he was left high and dry when a gospel singer failed to pitch for an event. The founder of Gates of Faith Church in Olievenhoutbosch, Tshwane, told Daily Sun gospel singer Zaza Mokhethi was paid but failed to perform at the show. He said he paid her R15 000 to sing at the show at AFM Church in Limpopo in August, but she didn’t show up.  Andy said Zaza asked for R20 000 before the show and he managed to pay her R15 000, but she was nowhere to be found on the day of the event.  Zaza’s manager and husband, Lebo Mokhethi, said Andy broke the contract they had with him. “We told him a 50% deposit should be made to secure a date and the balance be paid three days before the event,” he said. “He made the deposit in bits and pieces and failed to pay the balance three days prior.”
