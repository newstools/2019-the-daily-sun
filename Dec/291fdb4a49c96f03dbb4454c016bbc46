TROUBLED Richmond municipal manager Bongiwe Mnikathi has finally bowed out. She handed in her resignation letter on Tuesday, but didn’t give reasons why she was leaving the KZN municipality. READ: WE POKE FOR NYAOPE! The drama around Mnikathi started last October when allegations were made about irregularities in awarding tenders. Municipal speaker Samora Ndlovu said Mnikathi tried all the delaying tactics and did not allow the municipality’s disciplinary inquiry to test allegations against her. He said Mnikathi came up with excuses each time she was due to attend a disciplinary inquiry. “She first started by saying she wanted special leave as she feared for her life after receiving death threats. She then took the municipality to the Labour Court to try to stop the inquiry,” said Ndlovu. He said she handed over the resignation letter on the day she went to the Labour Court. He revealed that her application to the court was not successful. “In the letter, she didn’t mention why she was leaving. She just said she was resigning with immediate effect,” he said. “We’re still waiting for the full report from prosecutors to figure out the next step. We can’t comment on how we will proceed as we are still waiting for the full report.” READ: BHELE COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT In March, Cooperative Governance Department placed the municipality under administration over the issue. Mnikathi asked not to comment. “I called my legal adviser who advised me not to speak about the matter at hand until they are back in office in January,” she said.
