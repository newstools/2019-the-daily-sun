on Neyi, calling him a legend and a blessing to Spirit of Praise. “Our work
follows and speaks for us. He doesn’t have to speak much, but his work speaks. If there
was a time where I would say I was unable to do something, Neyi would do it. He has been
a gift to the whole industry. Everyone
was always joyful in his presence,” said Dube. “He was not
just a prophet, but he was able to write songs that were deep and mysterious,
he was a legend. There can never be a legacy without leaving a legacy behind.
The songs he wrote, were straight from the thrown of God,” he added. Dube said
the spirit of praise was blessed to have Neyi. Neyi will
be laid to rest on Wednesday.
