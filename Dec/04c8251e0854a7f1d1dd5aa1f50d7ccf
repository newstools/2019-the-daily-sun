THEY are old-timers who become young men when they’re on stage. They keep audiences on their feet with their slick dance moves, which include tango, foxtrot and jiving. Dance group Banna Ba Makgoba, formed in 2013, is based in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. It started with a few members and has since grown to over 30 members including newly recruited young men. They’re all aged between 20 and 55. On weekends, they either practise or perform at social gatherings such as weddings and at shopping malls. Group organiser George Malaka told Daily Sun their commitment to dancing kept them away from wasting away in taverns. “When we’re not practising and performing, we either spend time with our families or are at work. “We hardly have time to do anything else. “We’re a very disciplined group. We use our time productively and enjoy what we do.” He said they mostly danced to wedding songs and had more than 50 dance moves. “From an early age, I’ve always loved wedding songs. “I previously belonged to another group. “In 2013, when we were attending a friend’s wedding, we stood up and started dancing. “The guests cheered for us and were very impressed. “It was in that moment that we decided to form the group. “It’s been fulfilling to see the crowd appreciating our moves when we perform.” But the lack of sponsorship limits them. “We often have to dig deeper into our pockets to cover transport costs. “Potential sponsors don’t show interest in what we do. But we’ll keep the faith. “We hope to one day be nominated for big awards.”
