POLICE Minister Bheki Cele undertook a countrywide inspection of police operations over the weekend. Cele visited roadblocks and spoke to communities in a bid to curb crime over the festive season. On Friday, accompanied by Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela and Joburg Metro police chief David Tembe, he visited Diepsloot, Mashamplani squatter camp and Olievenhoutbosch. Later that afternoon he went to the Mall of Africa in Midrand, where he talked to shoppers. He urged people drinking alcohol in restaurants to do so responsibly. “We hope none of you drinking here will be behind the wheel, said Cele. “Make use of Uber once you’ve had one too many. We want to ensure there are no fatalities on our roads.” On Saturday, he went to Bloemfontein, where he threatened to close down illegal taverns. He said crime was linked to taverns. “If I’m not mistaken, this province has 9 000 taverns. We don’t want to have taverns that close at 4am,” said Cele. “We don’t want taverns that don’t respect the law. Those that have no permits must shut down within 48 hours.” He also visited Twin City Mall in Heidedal, Majakathatha Taxi Rank and a roadblock on the N8 between Botshabelo and Thaba-Nchu. But residents were not happy with taverns being closed during the festive season. Thapelo Plaatjies said: “Some of us don’t have money to travel to legal taverns. It’s safer to drink closer to home. “I’m against the minister threatening to close down illegal taverns.” Lerato Tselepedi (50) said: “We’re happy to see the minister at the taxi rank ensuring we travel safely. We ask that he continue with the operation.”
