FIVE armed men wearing balaclavas robbed three foreigners of an undisclosed amount of cash in front of a Standard Bank branch in Bloemfontein on Tuesday. A witness said it looked like an accident. “I was at the ATM when I saw a vehicle with three men trying to park next to a car occupied by Chinese people. Then a car drove over the pavement and when the Chinese men went to see if they could help, two men in balaclavas jumped out of the car and held them up at gunpoint,” he said. He said the robbers took the money bags the men were carrying. A security guard said: “The robbers caught us off guard. While I went to see what was happening, they came out armed and fled with the cash.” Colonel Thandi Mbambo said a case of armed robbery was opened. “A 35-year-old Chinese businessman and his colleagues visited a bank on Nelson Mandela Drive,” she said. “The complainant and his colleagues were allegedly approached by three unknown men armed with pistols when they were about to enter the bank. The three colleagues were threatened with firearms and they dropped the bags containing cash on the ground. “They were then robbed. The suspects fled the scene in a white Toyota Conquest without number plates.” Mbambo said anyone with information should call Captain David Ramasoala on 082 468 1624.
