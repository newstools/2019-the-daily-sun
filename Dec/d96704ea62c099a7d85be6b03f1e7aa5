THE purpose of the International Anti-corruption day seminar was to find ways to prevent fraud and corruption in the public sector. Among the 351 delegates who attended the seminar on Monday in Bloemfontein was Free State Finance MEC Gadija Brown. She said the purpose of the seminar was to raise awareness and promote alertness in areas that were exposed to fraud and corruption. “I’d like to walk out of this seminar with a sustainable system to deal with the root cause and prevention of fraud and corruption in the workplace,” said Brown. She said part of the plan would be the vetting of officials and suppliers and to complete thorough lifestyle audits on vulnerable officials. “It’s up to all of us to say no to corruption,” she said. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela lashed officials who stole state funds. “Fraud and corruption is a dangerous disease that destroys service delivery. “Corruption is an obstacle to the progress of our nation and is slowly killing our country,” said Ntombela. “It’s wrong to promise our people houses but the houses aren’t built because of corruption,” she said. She said money was paid to build schools but the structures were never finished. “Any government officials who are involved in corruption will face the full might of the law,” said Ntombela.
