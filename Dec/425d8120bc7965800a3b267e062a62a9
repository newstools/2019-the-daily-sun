Orlando Pirates have confirmed that both Ntsikelelo Nyauza and Vincent Pule are sidelined with injuries but could be ready for the Black Leopards clash. Nyauza and Pule both picked up hamstring injuries in the 2-2 draw against Baroka FC last weekend but could be back in action on 21 December against Black Leopards. "The Bucs medical team has revealed the full extent of the injury to defender Ntsikelelo Nyauza," a statement on the club website said. "Nyauza was forced to be replaced early in the second half in Pirates' 2-all draw against Baroka FC last weekend in what appeared to be a hamstring injury. "According to the medical team, Ntsiki has indeed suffered a hamstring strain but the good news is that itâ€™s a minor injury. "The 29-year old has suffered a Grade 1 strain and is expected to be out for between 4-5 days as he works closely with the rehabilitation staff." Pule's injury was described as a Grade Two hamstring strain which could keep him out of action for up to 10 days.
