Cassper Nyovest has done it again! Abuti Fill Up held his annual fill up concert on Sunday and history was made. He filled up the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in his home province, North West. This was the fourth year of the event with the first taking place at Orlando Stadium in 2016. The second one was at FNB Stadium, then Moses Mabhida last year. Check the pictures below.
