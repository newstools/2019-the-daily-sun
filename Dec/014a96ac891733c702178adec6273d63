BACK in the day, talking to children about sex was a taboo and always frowned upon. This was because the elderly didn’t want kids to engage in sexual relationships before marriage. But was this the right thing to do? SunWellbeing spoke to attendees of a Durex event held at Maponya Mall, Soweto, recently. Lindiwe Ngwenya (52) from Zondi, in Soweto, said she has two daughters, one is a 30-year-old and the other 23. Lindiwe told the People’s Paper: “I always talk openly to my children about sex.” She said although her kids are shy to talk to her about sex, she always felt it was important to do so. “Our parents weren’t equipped to talk to us about sex and relationships,” she said. “This is not helping because these days, our girl children fall pregnant before the right time and also catch illnesses such HIV/Aids.” She said if people used condoms, we wouldn’t have a high rate of HIV infections. Mpolokeng Sithole said if you cheat you should condomise. Nono Montshonyane and Tshidi Tsotetsi both said they always go to the local clinic to fetch male condoms to ensure their partners are safe. “We prefer using male condoms than the female ones because you don’t have to wait a certain time after putting it on,” said Tshidi. Molly Khumalo, brand manager for Durex, said the aim of the company’s #PledgeSafeSex campaign was to raise awareness about HIV/Aids and other sexually transmitted diseases. The company will be travelling around Mzansi this festive season, teaching people about the importance of using condoms.
