POLICE have carried out more than two dozen extrajudicial killings in a systematic campaign against hardcore criminals , according to a report. The report was released on Friday in Blantyre by the Centre for Human Rights Education, Advice and Assistance. The campaign has been dubbed “Operation Elimination”. The group’s deputy director, Chikondi Chijozi, said the report had been handed over to ombudsman Martha Chizuma for urgent action, but Chizuma said she hadn’t received a copy yet. “The findings of the research are quite alarming to us,” Chijozi said.  “We thought it would be important to submit it to the office of the ombudsman so they do a thorough investigation to find out what happened to the 28 people who died under very suspicious circumstances.” Police spokesman James Kadadzera said he needed time to consult his superiors. According to the report, there have been reports in recent years of extrajudicial killings by Malawian cops of hardcore criminals such as former prisoners and those suspected, charged, tried and convicted of serious violent crimes including armed robbery. Barbara Banda, head of the Gender Co-ordination Network rights group, urged the authorities to ensure thorough investigation into the alleged rape, defilement and torture of innocent women and girls. Malawi police have set up a commission to investigate the allegations. – NEWS24
