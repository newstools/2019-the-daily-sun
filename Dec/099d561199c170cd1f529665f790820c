Mbalula said the administrator will run the affairs of Prasa as a board of control as envisaged in the Prasa founding law and as an accounting authority in terms of the Public Finance Management Act. He said the continued declining quality of service Prasa provides to the commuting public requires that urgent interventions be put into place. Bongisizwe Mpondo is the newly appointed administrator of Prasa with immediate effect. Speaking at a media briefing, yesterday Mbalula said during their first 100 days in office, they tackled pressing challenges that constrain service delivery. He said those efforts made it possible for them to reimagine the role of transport while moving towards social freedom. He said that’s why they established the Prasa War Room a few months ago. Regarding the board, Mbalula said they conducted a review on the performance of the board. “Prasa has deep-rooted challenges that require decisive interventions at leadership and management levels.” READ: MAN BUYS A BANANA FOR R1,7 MILLION He said the assessment report from the Government Technical Advisory Centre highlights Prasa’s dysfunctionality and records non-compliance with financial rules that warrant immediate action. This intervention will continue for 12 months, after which a permanent board will be appointed. The process to recruit a permanent board will be initiated after six months.
