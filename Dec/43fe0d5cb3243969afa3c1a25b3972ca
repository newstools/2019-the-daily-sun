 On Saturday mourners gathered to pay tribute to Paballo Potloane. Those who knew her called her 'Pabi'. In tears, they said they were robbed of a beautiful soul. The funeral service was held at Forte High School in Dosbsonville, Soweto - before she was laid to rest in Roodepoort cemetery. Paballo (25) was brutally killed two days before Christmas at her home in Braamfischer, Soweto.

Her throat was slit after two men broke into the house where she was sleeping with her sister, Makgotso who saw the horror unfold. Paballo's cousin, Matshidiso Tshabalala said: "She was very soft spoken and respectful. A very beautiful young woman just like her mother." A neighbour, Nombulelo Mthimkhulu said: Paballo was a pillar. The tragedy was not a mistake but God's plan because we have distanced ourselves from him. We need to go back to the basics of ubuntu and love.  Mothers should protect young girls, and young women and men should unite," she said. It is understood that days leading up to her death, Paballo was receiving threats allegedly from a sangoma woman who is married to a former ANC man, whose identity is known to Daily Sun . These whatsapp messages have since been circulating among friends and family. In one message, a G-string believed to belong to Paballo is put next to a knife and smeared with muthi, followed by a meassge threatening Paballo that if she is pregnant she will abort through her mouth and she will learn how strong muthi works. Another message reads: "I'm not gonna lose my marriage over a trash like you. You have declared war." Paballo's family told Daily Sun that after she was murdered, the killer made a phone call and told the person the job was done. They said they were not aware of Paballo's love affairs and whether she was pregnant. Matshidiso added that if they knew that Paballo was in danger they could have helped. Police are investigating a case of murder and robbery and no arrests have been made yet.
