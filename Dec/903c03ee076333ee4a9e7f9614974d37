  A 14-year-old boy drowned in an irrigation dam on a farm in Groblersdal. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the boy Bafana Boshielo
was playing with his friends next to the dam when they decided to swim. The boy reportedly quickly sank and by the time his peers rushed to raise an
alarm, it was too late to save him. He
was certified dead by the emergency services. According to Mojapelo, the boy had gone to visit his mother at her workplace, a
farm in the Groblersdal area, when the incident happened. Mojapelo urged parents and guardians to constantly look after their children
and make sure they don’t access dangerous waters.
