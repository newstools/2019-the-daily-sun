 The Department of Basic Education urged the public to be wary of what it deems “fake news” suggesting it reduced the pass mark for Mathematics to 20%. "This could not be further from the truth," spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said. "It is mischievous of some people to take old information and make it look like it is a new policy directive." Mhlanga singled out two news reports published in 2016 wrongfully claiming that the Maths pass mark would be dropped to 20%. "Both articles got it wrong back in 2016 when the issue first came up, and they are still wrong today," he said. "We condemn the misleading headline, and the peddling of false information." He said the issue had previously been clarified when the reports first surfaced and now the false information seemed to resurface again.
