AT LEAST three South African Volunteer Awards (Sava) are collecting dust at Dr Bhekisisa Ngcobo’s office. The awards belong to gospel artists Babo Ngcobo, Thinah Zungu and maskandi artist Qhoshangokwenzakwakhe Sibisi. The artists won these awards in 2017 at the fifth Sava event, held at Mfolozi Casino, in eShowe, KZN. Babo won Best Gospel Artist, Thinah won Best Song of the Year for Jesu Ufika Ekuseni and Qhosha won Best Maskandi Performance. Bhekisisa told Sunday Sun he was disappointed that the artists had not collected their awards. “The awards are held annually with the purpose of honouring artists for their work. The event took place two years ago and I’ve done everything in my power to give them these awards but I’ve failed. It seems as though they are not interested in collecting them,” he said. But Qhosha said he was never part of the event. “I always attend Bhekisisa’s events, but I was never invited or informed about this one. I am surprised that I won an award. Even after the event, nobody told me I had won otherwise I would have collected it. But I will speak to Bhekisisa and maybe even collect the award,” said Qhosha. Babo said: “I truly appreciate his gesture. I’ve been intending to collect it, but unfortunately I’ve been too busy, I totally forgot about it. What I’ve done is wrong and disheartening. I hope he forgives me. I will collect it by next week.” Thinah said the award had a sentimental value to him. “I heard about the award some time ago but I don’t recall receiving an invite. I’ve been busy but will try to make time to collect it,” he said.
