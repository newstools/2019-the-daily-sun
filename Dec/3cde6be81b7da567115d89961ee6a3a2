SEVEN bodies were found dumped at the N12 highway in Benoni on Thursday night. The Ekurhuleni EMS spokesman, William Ntladi told Daily Sun that they received a call about seven bodies that were dragged from somewhere else and dumped there at approximately 8:10pm. They were all facing upwards with bullet wounds and one of them had burn wounds. "We're still in the process of identifying the bodies which are all males. It is suspected that the men might have been killed underground and might be part of the on-going illegal mining activities," said Ntladi. Police are appealing to communities to assist in identifying the bodies estimated to be aged between 30 and 40-years-old. Anyone with information regarding the incident can contact the police anonymously on 08600 10111 or Captain Manetha from Provincial Organised Crime at 082 411 4677.
