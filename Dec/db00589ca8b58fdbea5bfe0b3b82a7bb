BLACK Leopards will beef up their squad in January with the signing of midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase. SunSport has reliably learnt that Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs will loan Ntshangase to his former club in order to get more game time. The 26-year-old player has been struggling to break into coach Ernst Middendorp’s starting line-up, or let alone sit on the bench this season. The last time he kicked a ball in an official match was in April when he played only 15 minutes during Amakhosi’s 1-0 league win over Bloemfontein Celtic away last season. Said the source: “Leopards management have enquired about the services of Ntshangase as coach Luc Eymael wants to strengthen his midfield. Chiefs have agreed to loan out the player until the end of season and the deal between the two teams will be sealed prior to the festive break.” Ntshangase’s agent Jazzman Mahlakgane was in the dark regarding his player’s move back to Thohoyandou, where he is popular. “Chiefs haven’t told me anything and until then, my mouth is shut.” However, Mahlakgane revealed that his player could stay with the Absa Premiership leaders since he has recently impressed the German-born mentor. “What the team has told me is different. I heard from the technical staff that Ntshangase has done well in the past few weeks. “But if there is anything else, they will let me know.” Ntshangase was a regular under the guidance of then Chiefs coaches Steve Komphela and Giovanni Solinas, but his lack of consistency also robbed him the chance of being part of the Bafana Bafana set-up. His work-rate dropped from the time he was at Leopards and Baroka FC. The expectations from the club fans have been huge since Amakhosi haven’t won anything in the past four years. This has made the Chiefs jersey to be heavy on Ntshangase whenever he is thrown in the deep end.
