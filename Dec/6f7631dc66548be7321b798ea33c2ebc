Dalindyebo’s release came after President Cyril Ramaphosa and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola announced last week the king would benefit from the remissions they granted to more than 40 000 prisoners across Mzansi. Dalindyebo was sentenced by the Eastern Cape High Court in 2015 to 15 years in prison. His sentence was later reduced by three years by the Supreme Court of Appeal. The AbaThembu Royal family commended Lamola and the department for the king’s release. “The absence of his majesty marked a period of division within the Abathembu nation and the matter eventually landed in the Grahamstown High Court, under the leadership of the AbaThembu royal adviser, Advocate Matthew Mpahlwa. “The period also brought no peace, stability, unity or social cohesion in the kingdom,” said chairman of the Ngangelizwe Royal Family, Nkosi Thanduxolo Mtirara. He said on his return, Dalindyebo would have the task to build unity and restore the dignity of the nation. Dalindyebo’s spokesman Mthunzi Ngonyama, said the king appreciated efforts by traditional and religious leaders for his release. READ: ANDILE GUMBI'S SON SHOT! “He is now with his family.
