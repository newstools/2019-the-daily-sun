after it found that the company has engaged in banned conducts by contributing
the Ford Kuga 1.6 Eco Boost as some of them caught fire. Ford South
Africa was fined R35 million for selling problematic Kugas. Acting head
of the Commission, Thezi Mabuza, said the commission and Ford reached a
settlement agreement for the 160 complainants. According
to the Mabuza the complainants will have three options. She said
the first option is a settlement of R50 000 which will be a full and final
settlement. "This
is the refund, repair or replacement of the vehicle, which Ford has already
paid. However, if
the complainant feels the damages incurred by the vehicle combusting is more
they can enter an arbitration process. The
Commission says it will be up to the complainant to prove that the damages
incurred were more than R50 000. She said
between 2016 and 2017 at least 56 Ford Kugas which are 1.6 Eco-Boost vehicles

disturbing number of complaints in a short time from one company. She said
the amount spent by Ford was considered when determining R35 million the

conducted an investigation and found a failure in the cooling system of the
particular model which was manufactured in Spain specifically for South Africa
and that was the cause of the fire.‚Äù She said
Ford engaged in prohibited conduct by distributing vehicles that failed. "The
investigation did reveal that there was no negligence," she said.
