THE 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children comes to an end today but last month alone, Mzansi heard of some shocking stories, including the murder of Precious Ramabulana, who was stabbed 52 times. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko hosted a criminal justice system seminar in Joburg yesterday. It was aimed at exploring best practices in the management of gender-based violence cases.

Mazibuko said it was time for the courts to take abuse matters seriously and deal with the suspects. “Our courts must be sensitive to women, especially young girls because they’re the main victims of women killings,” she said. Rape victim Jabu Mbatha (26) was also part of the seminar. Jabu, her husband and another couple were attacked by eight men at a park in Kensington, Joburg, in 2015. After they were robbed, two men committed shocking crimes on the couples. Jabu said: “They forced our husbands to strip naked before taking them to the lake where they were drowned.” Jabu thought the horror was over, but one of the men told her to bend. “He raped me while the other guy pointed a gun at me. I thought I was going to die,” she said.  The other woman ran away. Jabu said she forgave her attackers and was on a mission to share her story with other victims. “It isn’t every day where abuse victims make it out alive. I’m on a healing process.”
