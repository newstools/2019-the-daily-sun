ETHEKWINI Municipality has defended its title. On Sunday, it was again crowned the SA Local Government Association games champions. The municipality promised to fight tooth and nail to defend its title, and was victorious after playing against 11 districts which it hosted in the city. It was followed by King Cetshwayo District in second position, while third position was taken by uMgungundlovu district. Mayoral spokesman Mluleki Mntungwa said they were excited to be victorious and also proud of the athletes who represented them. “We attribute the victory to the effort put in by our team, as well as the proper infrastructure. “I believe we executed what was required from us because we had top-class sporting infrastructure,” said Mntungwa. He said they were grateful to the organisers for choosing their city to host more than 4 000 athletes. Mntungwa said the fact that no incidents were reported during the games proved the city was capable of hosting big events. “We’re still going to invest more in sport facilities to ensure that we mould athletes who’ll represent us in the national teams and even on the global stage,” he said. Sport and Recreation MEC Hlengiwe Mavimbela congratulated all the districts that took part in the four-day tournament. She announced that next year’s games would be hosted by Amajuba District.
