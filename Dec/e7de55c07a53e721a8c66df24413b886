THERE’S no doubt, Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt would have had his players do a lot of shooting drills in training this week. This after the55-year-old admitted he was worried by his side’s recent struggles in front of goal. The Students have only managed to find the back of the net once in their last three matches, a statistic Hunt is determined to change. Their last goal came from the penalty spot in a 1-1 draw with Highlands Park in the league almost a fortnight ago. Wits shot blanks against Guinea’s Horoya AC in their opening Caf Confederation Cup match at Dobsonville Stadium last Sunday. Hunt will be hoping his charges have their scoring boots on today (6pm) when they face Djoliba AC from Mali at the Stade du 26 Mars. “You can see where our problem is. I think that’s very clear for everyone to see,” said Hunt. “We’ve gone one too many matches without a goal, but it’s not for a lack of trying. “We’re creating a lot of chances. We’re just not converting them.” Wits midfielder Sameehg Doutie echoed the same sentiments as his coach. The 30-year-old former Orlando Pirates and SuperSport United player believes once they start scoring goals, they will be a force to be reckoned with in the competition. The Students, who are in the group stages of the Confed Cup for the first time, will look to progress to the knockout stages at the first attempt. They are in a tightly contested Group C alongside Horoya, Djoliba and Al Nasr, who are all equal on one point after the first round of matches. “We played quite well, we just need to put the ball in the back of the net,” said Doutie. “The guys have been working hard. We qualified for the group stages, it wasn’t easy. “We’re here now, we just need to continue working hard. “The coach and the rest of the technical team have been working hard. We just need to go out there and implement their game plan.”
