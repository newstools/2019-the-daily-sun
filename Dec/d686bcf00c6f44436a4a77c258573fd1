KAIZER Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka admits he doesn't know anything about the reported interest in him from Scottish club Rangers. It has been reported that manager Steven Gerrard's side are looking to bring Maluleka to Scotland in January but the 30-year-old insists there has been no discussions as far as he knows. "I have been hearing rumours but to be honest I haven't really heard anything [official]," Maluleka told the media. "And if the club (Rangers) haven't spoken to Kaizer Chiefs about it then there is no link at all. "So, I know nothing about that and I have a contract at Kaizer Chiefs and I am here to honour that." Maluleka, who has never played abroad, was however flattered by the rumour and reckons it shows he has been playing well recently. "Well, all the players work very hard and they work for a reason. So, if there is a link it means I have been doing something right. "I will always work hard regardless of anything."
