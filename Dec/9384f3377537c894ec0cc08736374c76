THE R15 billion increase in the purchase price of Transnet locomotives was not justifiable. Expert witness Alister Chabi yesterday told the Zondo Commission of Inquiry that although the company was happy with the initial R38,6 billion for the purchase of the locomotives, the increase was just too high and could not be explained. “We felt that 41% was too large an increase. An 11% increase would have been more acceptable,” he said. Chabi was tasked with investigating the locomotives and a report he has since submitted points to irregularities. Yesterday he spent most of the day dealing with the business transactions as well as the purchase price. He will continue with his testimony next week when he is expected to testify on irregularities. He said during their investigations, they came across 100 locomotives that were not part of the initial deal of purchase. Chabi said that could have been mandated by Transnet. He added they never probed why the 1 064 trains were necessary but looked at how they would profit Transnet and how jobs were going to be created.
