New Orlando Pirates head coach Josef Zinnbauer has called for his team to improve despite beating Black Leopards 3-1 in his first match in charge in South Africa's top-flight. Innocent Maela gave the Buccaneers the lead in the first half before Gabadinho Mhango doubled their advantage just after the hour mark. Mwape Musonda pulled a goal back for Lidoda Duvha after the interval but Mhango made sure Pirates took all three points when he converted a penalty with less than 20 minutes remaining. It was the first match in charge of the Buccaneers for German mentor Zinnbauer and, while happy to collect maximum points, he was not satisfied with the performance. Zinnbauer told SuperSport TV after the game: "I think we have a good structure, we have a good team, we have a very good quality but the little things that we do now, is the things that works in football, you make this and you change a little bit the things and then you get more success. "You have more control about the game. In the first-half we had a lot of chances, we don't make the goals, that's the problem, you don't make the goals, the opponent is coming, they get one chance or two and they make a goal, that's football. "But the most important thing for me, they come back again, they get a goal and we come back quickly, that's very good." Pirates are now fifth in the standings with their next match against Bloemfontein Celtic on 4 January next year.
