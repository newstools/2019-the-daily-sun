THE long awaited for good news have since surfaced in Mzansi. The abducted South African photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed is now free after escaping captivity in Syria where he was kept for three years. In a statement, aid Organisation Gift of the Givers shared the good news the South African media fraternity and the family of Shiraaz has been waiting for.“Gift of the Givers received the encouraging news, from unknown sources yesterday, that Shiraaz Mohamed is FREE. The details are sketchy but we were told that Shiraaz "escaped" from captivity and at some point was assisted by "friendly" people, who were very aware of his case, given the huge publicity Gift of the Givers initiated worldwide around Shiraaz's capture.” Imtiaz Sooliman of Gift of the Givers said, “We thanked the caller for contacting us but informed him that we had withdrawn from Shiraaz's case on 26 June 2019 as the family had decided to go with an alternative option.“ We asked, that even though we are no longer involved, if he would consider sending us a picture of Shiraaz to pass on to his distraught family and to ensure that it is indeed Shiraaz that he is referring to. He graciously responded with one picture immediately.”Sooliman added in a statement that late at night he sent us a second picture and said it was taken just before Shiraaz was handed over to Turkish Intelligence. “He said in the absence of our involvement in the case it was the best option for Shiraaz given the volatility, instability and extremely dangerous situation inside Syria, coupled with Shiraaz's understandable anxiety to get out of Syria instantly at any cost.” Gift of the Givers have informed Shiraaz's family, Minister Naledi Pandor and Consular Services at DIRCO. Last month the family resorted planned a fundraising campaign as a desperate measure and last resort to raise funds for Shiraaz’s release. The captors had apparently sent communication that they needed the money they spent all these years they had kept in there.
