DA chief whip Natasha Mazzone said the party wanted ANC MP Bongani Bongo to be axed from Parliament. This comes after the ANC’s integrity commission called on Bongo to resign from all leadership positions as he faces corruption charges. Mazzone yesterday told Daily Sun she was shocked to see the ANC bringing a man entangled in corruption charges back to Parliament. She said Bongo was even made chairman of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs. “It was a disgrace of the highest order that he was returned to Parliament and, more especially, as chairman,” she said. Integrity committee chairman George Mashamba said the ANC had zero tolerance for corruption, which was why it was recommended that Bongo step aside until the criminal charges were cleared. Mazzone said bringing Bongo back to Parliament was an insult. “In my address to Parliament this year, I took it as a personal left hook to the jaw when a man accused of bribing Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara, evidence leader of the Eskom inquiry into state capture, was rewarded with a chairman,” said Mazzone. Bongo was bust by the Hawks recently and released on R5 000 bail. It was business as usual when he returned to Parliament as portfolio committee chair. He told MPs he’d allow justice to take its course.
