POLICE are looking for thugs who robbed two cash vans on Friday. The thugs fled with an undisclosed amount of cash, leaving guards injured. The incidents took place in two separate areas in Tshwane. Police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili said cops have launched a massive manhunt for the robbers. In one incident in Pretoria West, a security guard was shot and wounded. Muridili said the guard had just collected cash at a store in the Kit Kat Shopping Centre. He was walking towards the cash van when a man came up to him and shot him in the right leg and robbed him. Muridili disputed rumours that two robbers fled in an ambulance, as reported on social media. She said the second robbery took place on the N1 freeway near Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane. “A vehicle allegedly drove into the van, causing it to roll. Another vehicle, an SUV, arrived at the scene,” she said. She said three suspects armed with rifles got out of their car and approached the armoured vehicle. “The suspects allegedly used explosives to bomb the vehicle and fled the scene with the money,” Muridili said. She said the guards were all injured and taken to hospital. SBV Group CEO Mark Barret said his company’s teams were investigating the incident. He urged anyone with information to call 083 408 7029.
