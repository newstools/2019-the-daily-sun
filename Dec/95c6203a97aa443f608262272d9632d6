IN THE first few months after birth, babies develop eye-hand coordination and start tracking moving objects. But this was the opposite for Victor Ntsinde, which worried his mum Cynthia. The 34-year-old from Sihlabeni Village in Ngqamakhwe, Eastern Cape, said residents consoled his mum that her baby’s handeye coordination would improve as he grew up. “But after a year an ophthalmologist confirmed that I was born blind. “My mum wasn’t happy. She asked for an eye operation, but my dad Yisehleli refused. “He said there was no need to fight God’s plan,” Victor said. He said he was independent as a child and people couldn’t believe he was blind. Victor went to Efata School for the Blind and Deaf in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, when he was six years old. He studied there from 1991 until 2004. “This is where I learnt how to use Braille, computers, play sport and do laundry and other daily activities,” said Victor. He then studied development studies at the University of Limpopo for four years. He now works as a switchboard operator at the Department of Water and Sanitation in Tshwane. When he’s not at work, Victor plays goalball and cricket. Goalball is a team sport designed specifically for athletes with a vision impairment.
