THE impasse between producer Duma Ka Ndlovu and Uzalo executive producers Gugu Zuma-Ncube and Pepsi Pokane has finally been put to bed. This she cleared in an interview with the SunTeam this week, in which she said when Uzalo was commissioned, the SABC asked Duma to act as a mentoring producer for one year, because he had more experience. Gugu explained: “It’s SABC policy that when a production is big and new, an experienced producer comes on board to mentor the new production.” She said although Duma was initially brought on to be a mentor for one year, he also contributed some ideas, but is no longer part of the show. “He’s served his time and has finished his mentoring duties as per the SABC’s request.” Now that the drama is out of the way, Gugu is enjoying the fruits of her labour. This as the SABC announced last month that Uzalo is one of the SABC’s biggest soapies. “We were told last week that Uzalo has reached the 10,6 million viewership mark,” she said. She said being a woman is tough enough in the male-dominated industry, but being a Zuma is even tougher, as “you have to prove yourself 10 times more”. I didn’t get ahead because of my surname, but because of hard work and passion”. Her latest drama series Ifalakhe on Mzansi Magic is showing weekdays. “It’s a pre-colonial drama about who we were before we were colonised. “We shied away from using super famous people because, as Stained-Glass Productions, we pride ourselves in unearthing fresh talent,” she said. While Gugu is a career-driven woman, she also loves her family, and spends quality time with them. “I balance my life and take time out to be with family, including my siblings.” SABC acting spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo said: “The SABC respects its working relationship with all producers and is not in a position to discuss how they relate between themselves.”
