LIMPOPO has more shebeens than churches, and that is where the problems start. This is according to Minister of Police Bheki Cele, who urged the police in the province to close down illegal shebeens. Addressing the police at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane yesterday during his visit to the province to check on the Sizojika Izinto campaign, he said the province had 42 churches but 14 000 shebeens.

When Christmas arrives, the people of Limpopo must be free from illegal liquor outlets.” He said the province would always be remembered as the place where a person raped and stabbed a woman 52 times. He said cops must earn the respect of the community and make criminals fear them. “Don’t use your uniform for wrong things. We can change your blue uniform to orange if you do criminal activities,” he said. BABES WODUMO'S WEIGHT LOSS SHOCKS FANS!
