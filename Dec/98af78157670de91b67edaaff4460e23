COMEDIAN and businessman Kedibone Mulaudzi was left out of pocket after he was scammed by hackers. The incident took place last month, in the same week as the 10th anniversary of the Soweto Comedy Festival, his brainchild. He revealed to Daily Sun that his FNB bank account was hacked through his manager’s email account. He said the money the hackers stole was deposited into a Nedbank account. “I reported the matter to my bank and opened a case with the cops. FNB then froze my account and I couldn’t attend to my business needs,” he said. Kedibone said this made it impossible for him to run his business. “For four days I was unable to make payments to my suppliers. Without payment, they withdrew their services. As a result I lost money. My question to both FNB and Nedbank is: who should be responsible for the huge loss my business suffered due to my account being frozen?” he asked. Kedibone said he was frustrated by FNB as it had not released the R9 000 taken by the scammers. FNB Business Core Banking CEO Daniel Kaan said Kedibone’s account was now active. “The outcome has been communicated to the customer. Due to client confidentiality, we cannot provide any further details.” said Kaan.
