FORMER Kaizer Chiefs star Hrndrick “Pule” Ekstein is having the time of his life in Azerbaijan. Ever since he moved to start a new challenge in the country, Ekstein has been enjoying himself both on and off the field of play. Off the field, the 28-year-old from Randfontein in the West Rand has been visiting some of the most famous places in Azerbaijan. One of them being the famous Heydar Aliyev Center, a building complex in the capital and commercial hub of Azerbaijan, Baku. Off the pitch, Ekstein has also been enjoying himself playing a key role for his new side Sabah Football Club in Azerbaijan's Premier League.  A negative mind will never give you a positive life. ??
