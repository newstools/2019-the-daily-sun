BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt has revealed that they will open cheque book in the January transfer window to add depth in his squad. The Students shared the spoils with Mamelodi Sundowns in the Absa Premiership match on Tuesday night. Wits had to come from behind to play a 1-1 draw against the Brazilians.After the match, Hunt stressed the need to get greater squad to add depth to his thread-bare roster of 21 players.“We just need a little more quality, we're struggling in one or two areas,” Hunt told SuperSport TV. “We only have 21 players, we're down to the bare minimum, so we need one or two that's for sure. “You come into the new season, you don't know whether it's going to be good or bad," "Right now, how many games have we played? 10 games, how many points?” he asked. “For a team of our size, I would have taken it at the beginning of the season. I would have taken it with the situation we're in. "I mean Chiefs is well on top, right now we've only played ten games, 20 games left, and I've always said the more we play, the better we all get. “We weren't playing at all at the beginning when everybody else was playing, so we're trying to find our rhythm and I think these games (in hand) will help us the more we play" The result left the Hunt’s Students occupying the fourth spot in the standings. They are 14 points behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs however, Wits still have three games in hand.
