UKHOZI FM DJ, Thembeka Zondo-Cele and her husband Bongani Cele welcomed their first bundle of joy together this month. The news was broken by Thembeka in an Instagram post on Wednesday. She said they named their bundle of joy Thalitha. The enthused Thembeka said: “Hubby and I have been trying to conceive for years but nothing happened. “We went to specialists and all tests came back positive, there was nothing wrong with either of us. But I just wasn’t getting pregnant.” According to Thembeka , she found it painful when people asked her when she was having a baby. “As if it’s your control,” she shrugged. She said she went through a period when she bought pregnancy tests and an ovulation kit, which kept giving the couple false hope. “I felt my spirit drop. “My mum knew my pain. What I was going through also pained her.” Thembeka told the SunTeam things changed after she asked her gogo to pray for her womb last year. “I’m born into a Christian family where we put everything before the Lord. My gogo prayed. She had a conversation with God. We both cried and she told me it was going to be alright.” She said two months following her gogo’s prayer, she discovered she was pregnant.
