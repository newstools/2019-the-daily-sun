YUMI Ishikawa’s feet bled after wearing high heels for her job. She and Japanese activists yesterday said forcing women to wear certain items was workplace harassment. Japanese women took to social media earlier this month to demand the right to wear spectacles at work. This came after reports of employers banning them, in the latest outcry against strict office dress codes forcing women to wear heels, stockings and makeup, or dictating shair colour. The labour ministry drafted guidelines in October against workplace harassment but failed to address employers dictating their workers’ dress. Ishikawa earlier this year began the #KuToo protest movement, which became a social media outcry. – REUTERS
