ITS December and most family members will be driving in one family car to their destination... But Masenya Masenya the spokesman of Limpopo family that lost seven of their loved ones in a multiple deadly car accident including a truck on the N1 between Petroport and Wallmansthal, Pretoria, is against that and has offered some advice. Speaking from experience, Masenya has advised that families should at least utilise separate cars from and to their destinations. "Our family has lost seven people all at once, had they used different transportation we would be burying three or less not seven. Let some of the members use taxis so that when accident happens others are saved." He said. Adam Matloa, Eunice Mothoa, Davis Mabasa, John Matloa, including three minor children Reatlegile Mothoa, Reyaleboga Mothoa and Gopolang Mabasa all died and burnt beyond recognition when their family car Toyota Corolla was involved in multiple car crash when they were traveling from Tembisa, Gauteng to Ga-Setshaba village in Limpopo. They are being buried today, three months later after the DNA results were released last week. Their mass funeral is currently underway at their home village today of Ga-Setshaba.
