"My partner just lies there like an ironing board!" If you have ever taken that as a sign that your partner was not enjoying sex with you, you could be mistaken! Experts say that there are subtle signs that your partner is really enjoying the sex - signs you could have easily missed. We asked sex expert Thandi Dlamini-Smith, a sexual advice consultant at the South African Sexual Skills Academy, to help us put our sexual signal goggles on and tell us the inconspicuous signs that the sex is lit! "Firstly, we have been conditioned to believe certain myths about the enjoyment of sex. These range from bar-talk with our buddies to societal norms and even what we see in porn; which is not realistic. If we do not get the reactions we expect from our partners, we end up disappointed and dejected - or worse - believing the opposite; that our sex game is on point when it's not!" According to Dlamini-Smith, these are what we should look out for: - Silent moans Most people believe that the louder the better. Actually, it is quite the opposite. When one is really enjoying the sex, they are silent and subtly moan, which shows they are engaged and concentrating on the act. - Intense eye contact Looking into each other's eyes shows that one is present. They are not visualizing anyone else or making a grocery list in their head. - Grabbing of sheets/blankets This is a sign that their body is giving in to the pleasure, and they want to hold on to whatever is nearby, in this case; the sheets or blankets. - Finger digging Similar to the blanket grabbing, digging your fingers into your partner is a subtle sign that says "I want more of what you are giving!" - A set position Contrary to popular belief, changing sexual positions during sex does not equal to enjoyment. Some people are moving around looking for the style that is most enjoyable. Lingering on a particular position shows that it is being enjoyed and they do not want to disturb the pleasure by switching it up.
