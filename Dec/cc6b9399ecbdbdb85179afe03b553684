THE family of a 14-year-old girl who was raped, tortured and murdered in 2015 believe the justice system has failed them. This after her killer, Sosha Nkosi (28), was sentenced to seven years in prison for kidnapping Ayanda Buthelezi from Nongoma, northern KZN. Nkosi got another 25 years for raping Buthelezi and a further 25 years for killing her. The family is angry that the sentences handed down in the Mtunzini Magistrates Court on Thursday will run concurrently. In November 2015, Buthelezi was on her way to church in the KwaMnyandu area when Nkosi offered to walk with her. After they had walked for over 1km, he dragged her into the bush, tied her up and raped her repeatedly over seven days. During that time, he starved her and gouged out her eyes. She was found dead in December. Ayanda’s aunt, Nokulunga Nene (24), said the family wanted Nkosi to be sentenced for more jail time. “We were hoping for five life sentences. The wickedness he showed towards a defenceless child can never be forgotten,” she said. “We’re going to see him roaming the streets very soon because the sentence is not long enough.” Nokulunga said the family has not recovered from Ayanda’s death. “She was a clever girl who loved books. We had no doubt education was going to give her a good chance of being a successful woman we would be proud of one day,” she said.
