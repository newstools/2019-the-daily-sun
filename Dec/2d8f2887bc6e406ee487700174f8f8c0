Selelo Mafukata needs help to find his lost bag. He said he lost it at Bosman Station in Tshwane on 12 December while boarding a bus to Limpopo. The 51-year-old said it was a small blue Puma bag with yellow straps. “The bag had my ID, diary, work certificates, mosquito net and clothes belonging to two of my children, aged 3 and 10,” he said. “The bag had important valuables and I’m begging anyone who has seen it to bring it back.”  He said he lost count of the number of times he visited bus officials to ask about his bag. Selelo, who is a community leader at Mooiplaas in Tshwane, said he’d been struggling to sleep since he lost it. He said mosquitoes were making life hell in Nzhelele, Limpopo.  “Whenever I travel home I carry my mosquito net to protect my family.” Selelo said he remembered loading his bag at the station at about 7.30am, but it was nowhere to be seen when he arrived home at 2pm. “I have searched everywhere,” he said. “This is a sad moment for me and the first time I’ve lost valuables,” he said. Selelo appealed to people to at least bring back his ID and diary. He said anyone who’d seen his bag or documents should call him on 079 669 4341 or 073 883 8065.
