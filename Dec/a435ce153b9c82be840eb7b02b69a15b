MPUMALANGA ghost town Pilgrims Rest is being revamped to attract tourists to the province. The once popular town, known for its rich history, is getting new landscaping. Mpumalanga Economic Development and Tourism MEC Pat Ngomane said during the project’s official launch they’d also redesign and upgrade signs in the town to increase visibility of places of interest. “It’s up to us to revitalise the town to attract more tourists. We must capitalise on its well-preserved historical infrastructure as one of the original gold mining towns in South Africa, and it still has a gold panning tradition.” He said the town has rare and potentially highly profitable heritage assets, scenic natural sites and political and industrial history. Ngomane said they’d start local creative tourism programmes such as craft, performances and tours. Thaba Chweu Mayor Fridah Nkadimeng said there’d also be job opportunities for residents..
