EVERY year Joyous Celebration always delivers a powerhouse show but on Christmas Day, according to some viewers, there was less joy than their fans had come to expect. The 24th installment of the annual Joyous Celebration album, which aired on SABC1 on Wednesday, left many viewers less than satisfied. On Twitter @Iam_Kardas expressed disappointment: “Joyous Celebration needs to take a break for a year or two. They definitely need it.” @MissManjo tweeted: “Joyous Celebration really is not what it used to be. Others are shouting at us unprovoked. Hai.” @Kulanicool’s tweet read: “Joyous Celebration should have stopped at Joyous 14.” @Nol_andile reminded fans of songs like Walk In Jerusalem, Zulu Worship/Wongigcina Ngci and Obrigado and said: “This is what Joyous Celebration once was.” Not all Twitter reviews were bad. Some people said they enjoyed the show. When called for comment, one of the founders and producers of the group, Lindelani Mkhize, said he wasn’t aware of the bad reviews people were sharing. “I’m not on social media. The only reviews I knew about were the ones that were sent to me by other people and they were good,” said Mkhize. “I’m not sure about the bad reviews you’re referring to.” He said he couldn’t talk further because he was busy running a show and referred Daily Sun to the group’s spokeswoman Helga Klizanie. Helga said she couldn’t talk. “I am dealing with a family issue and I can’t talk at the moment,” she said.
