De Ruyter was expected to start work on 15 January. But Mthembu said cabinet had asked Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to negotiate with him for an early start. “Cabinet fully supports all efforts meant to ensure electricity supply certainty in our country,” he said. He said De Ruyter and his management team would immediately deal with governance issues, the lack of financial management and the stabilisation of Eskom’s operations. Mthembu also announced that Deputy President David Mabuza would put together an energy war room that would include Gordhan, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe. He said the team would deal with any challenges to energy supply in the country. “Renewables will play a key role in our energy supply to complement the efforts of Eskom,” he said. Mthembu said the decision was taken on Friday. He said other issues that were discussed included SAA, Prasa and flooding.
