LIMPOPO Premier Stanley Mathabatha, Co-operative Governance, Housing and Traditional Affairs MEC Basikopo Makamu and Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka apologised to Dr Thomas Chauke at Xikundu tribal office outside Malamulele on Sunday. This after an incident at the Mapungubwe Music Festival last Saturday, where Chauke was interrupted while performing. Moraka apologised to Chauke. ANDILE GUMBI'S SON (4) SHOT! “I respect Dr Chauke. I was the one who insisted he should be part of the list of artists who performed,” she said. Mathabatha said the issue of ill-treatment should be condemned and no artist should go through something like that. Vatsonga royal leaders, through Hosi Busa Nxumalo, said it was important for the government to deal with issues of social cohesion. James Shikwambana, who was tasked to facilitate the conversation between Chauke and the Limpopo government, said both sides would release an official statement. NO CASH FOR RICK ROSS! But the Vatsonga royal leaders fined Mathabatha a goat and cow for arriving late at the meeting. The premier said he was late as he had to rearrange his trip to Lesotho. Moraka committed to organising an event to honour Chauke with the assistance of Makamu. Dr Chauke said: “I feel honoured that the premier assured me and the nation that ill-treatment will never happen to anyone at government events.”
