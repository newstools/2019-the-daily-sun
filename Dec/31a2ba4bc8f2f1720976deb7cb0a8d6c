SOCIAL Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale has appealed to Limpopo men to stop the violence against women and children. She’s worried the cycle of violence may continue as boys imitate their dads’ actions. She told Daily Sun how the recent violence in the province tore everyone apart, leaving families and residents devastated. “I’m concerned about the continuous incidents of gender-based violence. This is tearing our society apart. It leaves children without parents,” she said. Rakgoale said some men have apparently lost it. “We seriously need to activate our moral regeneration movement, faith-based organisations and other important partners for them to come on board and join us as we continue to take our social crime prevention campaigns to communities. Prevention is better than cure.” She reminded the people about the killings of Precious Ramabulana and Sarah Makhubele in Xihosana. “We heard about the brutal murder of Portia Ramakhavhi of Ha-Mutsha and Sebongile Nkanyane of Sekgosese, as well as other incidents. Sadly, a toddler was raped in Phalaborwa this week. “These are some of the incidents giving me and other leaders in government sleepless nights.” She said the incidents painted a bad picture and the numbers were not looking good. Rakgoale praised the real men who still loved and cared for their kids, partners and their mothers. “Abusers of women and children must be isolated from communities and be given harsher punishment. “They must just serve life sentences,” she said.
