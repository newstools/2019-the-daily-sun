PRECIOUS Ramabulana might be dead but she’ll never be forgotten! Her family will keep her legacy alive through the Precious Ramabulana Trust. The trust will be supported by President Cyril Ramaphosa, who visited the 21-year-old student’s family yesterday. “The family has decided to set up the Precious Ramabulana Trust, which will play a role in society. We’re ready to support it. Precious’ death is a national shame.” The president said what saddened him more was that the suspect (28) allegedly had a brush with the law on a rape charge. “This means we must have an active record of those who’ve been found guilty before. We should keep a close eye on them. “In fact, they should not be released, and when they’re in prison they should be subjected to hard labour,” he said. Nthatheni Ramabulana, a family representative, said: “We’ll just wait upon them and see when they will live up to their promises. “The government has promised to build us a house and to support the trust to keep Precious’ memories with us.”
