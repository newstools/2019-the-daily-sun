SHE went to visit her brother but instead of receiving a warm welcome, the 33-year-old woman was raped by a man of God. The suspect, who is a pastor from Ghana, is on the run. The victim, also from Ghana, who now lives in Boksburg, said the pastor visited her brother on the day of the incident on 26 October and stayed until late. “My brother asked him to sleep over as it was late,” she said. She said she was asleep on the floor in the lounge when she felt somebody touch her punani.  When she opened her eyes, she saw the pastor. “I tried to scream, but he put his hand on my mouth and undressed me,” she said. Her brother said he regretted inviting the pastor to sleep over. “He’s my friend and a man of God. I never thought he’d do something like this,” he said.  On 26 November, the woman opened a case of rape after she discovered she was pregnant and terminated the pregnancy. Police spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube said cops were on the hunt for the pastor. Ramaube confirmed a case of rape and assault was opened against the pastor. “We appeal to anyone with information to contact the Boksburg North Police Station or call 08600 10111,” said Ramaube.
