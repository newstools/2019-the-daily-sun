WHEN the SunTeam came across two men fighting like WWF wrestlers, they took pictures first and asked questions later. READ: FANS LASH BLACK COFFEE! They weren’t surprised to hear Daneka Obusi (38) and Jacob Sikele (19) were fighting over a woman! The woman, Refilwe Moneri (30) from Codesa 1 kasi in Mangaung, was honest about what was happening.  She said: “My boyfriend is lazy in bed. That’s why I got a Ben 10 to help him. My boyfriend must be grateful I didn’t leave him. I found a man who performs his duties.” She said she started dating the Ben 10 three months ago.“After two years, I still love my man because he supports me financially, but I needed more action in the bedroom. I like them both. I’m not breaking up with anyone.” Refilwe’s Ben 10 Jacob said: “I was with her when I got a hot klap. I didn’t know where it came from. He put me down and I tried to fight, but he overpowered me.”   He said he respected Daneka. “I didn’t go to their home. Refilwe is the one who came to me. I’m not going to open a case. I want revenge.” Daneka refused to comment, only saying he gave Refilwe money to enjoy on public holiday but now was paying for her unemployed Ben 10’s booze. Patron Masabatha Lethoko (28), said: “I was enjoying my booze when I saw two men on top of one another. I blame Refilwe for dating a Ben 10. She must get help for her boyfriend.” READ: WATCH: MY BLUE-EYED BOY IS NOT FOR SALE! Refilwe said Danela won’t break up with her and he said they must solve the problem.
