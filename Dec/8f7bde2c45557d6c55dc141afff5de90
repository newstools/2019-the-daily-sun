RAPPER Da L.E.S has a new release, not an album but a new girl! The SunTeam spotted the Lifestyle hitmaker at the Hip Hop Museum opening and the unveiling of the 26 inductees. Da L.E.S, who was also one of them, brought a special date, a mysterious white blonde. The two could not keep their hands off each other. They were not ashamed to display their affection in public. The swag which Da L.E.S carries translates to the type of women he has dated in the past. The North God, as many calls him, has been linked to some of Mzansi superstars such as actress Pearl Thusi and TV presenter K Naomi. He was also rumoured to have been involved with Queen B at some point. Sunday Sun has learnt that the rapper broke up with his baby mama Aurie Alexander a while ago, although they continue to co-parent.
