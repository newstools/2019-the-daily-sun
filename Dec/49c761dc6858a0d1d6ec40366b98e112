EXCITEMENT and joy was painted on the faces of the 195 families when they got food parcels on Wednesday. According to the Mthonjaneni Municipality in northern KZN, each of the 13 wards had 15 families who benefitted from the early Christmas food parcels. Beneficiary Beauty Ngema (57) from Qandolo Village said they were very thankful for the parcels. “We’re so excited. Just like other families who have money, we’re also going to have a beautiful Christmas.” Beauty said they’re a family of 10 but have no income. “No one is employed and no one is getting a government grant, so we were going to have a dark Christmas,” said Beauty. She said their challenge was that small kids didn’t understand there was no money to buy nice food. “The municipality has saved us from that problem. At least we don’t have to worry about explaining to the kids why we don’t have Christmas biscuits while our neighbours have them,” said Beauty. Items in the food parcels included biscuits, cooking oil, juice, maize meal, rice, flour, chicken braai packs and beans. Councillor Mbangiseni Biyela said the beneficiaries were selected through a committee room. “We were helped by community caregivers, ward committee members and izinduna who are the closest to the residents. “They know which families need help the most,” said Biyela.
