VICTORIA Dlamini grew up helping her late gogo Lena Mtshali, who knitted clothes to make a living. And now the 47-year-old from Braamfischerville, Soweto, is an experienced seamstress. “My gogo used blunt needles to slide loops of yarn over each other. I use sewing needles that penetrate the fabric. Both systems create clothing that we love to wear,” said Victoria. She said she was 10 years old when her gogo gave her panels of clothing to sew together and make a complete garment. After matric the seamstress, who grew up in Matiwane Village in KZN, joined a company where she received formal training. “I learnt how to use a sewing machine, understanding different types of fabrics, cutting patterns and the tools needed for sewing. I trained for six months and was hired. I worked at the company for six years,” she said. She later worked for three different companies in Gauteng before starting her own business. She specialises in school and church uniforms, traditional clothing and jumpsuits. She’s also a qualified caregiver. Victoria’s been working with her assistant Nomcebo Mabizela for three years. She said her dream was to open a factory so she could employ many people.
