SHEILA Senkubuge was proven to be a citizen and thus placed on the voters’ roll. That was the response of the Independent Electoral Commission to questions about the citizenship of the former roads and transport mayoral committee member in the City of Tshwane. “It’s on this basis that she could contest as a candidate in the 2016 general elections of municipal councils,” it said. According to DA’s provincial leader in Gauteng, John Moodey, a private citizen laid charges against Senkubuge, questioning whether she was qualified to hold a council seat. The IEC also said Home Affairs was the custodian of the country’s citizenship, while the electoral body was responsible for compiling and maintaining the voters’ roll. Meanwhile, acting DA mayor of the City of Tshwane Abel Tau said they wanted to find the truth behind the allegations. “It’s my responsibility to look into what really happened,” he said. Senkubuge has resigned in the meantime. Her four-page resignation letter came after the leaked sex audio tape involving her and Tshwane mayor Stevens Mokgalapa last Sunday. “In light of recent events and despite the many successes, it has become clear that attempts to vilify me are taking focus away from the purpose of my role in office,” said Senkubuge. The ANC Tshwane region said there was more to Senkubuge’s sudden resignation than what met the eye. “Following the release of the damning recording, other damning allegations have surfaced that not only affect this person but the entire facade put up by the DA,” said ANC Tshwane spokesman, Bafuze Yabo.
