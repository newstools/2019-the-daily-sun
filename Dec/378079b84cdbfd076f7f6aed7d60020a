THE festive trip to Algiers seems foremost in the mind of Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane. Buoyed by the TKO Cup win, the Brazilians turn their focus to the Caf Champions League where they have a group C lined up against Algerian side USM Alger on 28 December. But there is the small, yet important matter of a PSL fixture to address with Polokwane City, before they can pack their bags and head north of the continent. Winless in four league matches, City visit Sundowns at Loftus on Saturday (6pm), with new coach Clinton Larsen looking to register his first win. Without doubt the Brazilians are still savouring the TKO moment and basking in the glory of their first domestic knockout title in four years. But truth is they don’t have much time to wallow in the TKO euphoria as their tight fixture schedule barely allows for respite. They have already dropped two points against Bidvest Wits, as they played out a 1-1 on Tuesday at Moses Mabhida Stadium. “After arriving at home from KZN, we can now reflect on our five days spent at the coast,” said Mosimane. “It definitely was worth the stay. We can now take two days full rest before the Polokwane City game, but most importantly to prepare to spend Christmas Day in Algiers. “We have a tight schedule and we have to manage our games well. “The league is also important for us. We are still in the title race.” Downs skipper Hlompho Kekana knows all about the sacrifices when it comes to continental commitments. He is one of the mainstays in the Sundowns line-up, having been part of the 2016 Champions League-winning team. “We can’t feel sorry for ourselves spending Christmas away from home,” said Kekana. “It’s the sacrifices we make for the good of the club are huge. “We will be going to Algeria when everyone will be with their families having a braai. “Yet, we can’t complain. It’s part of the job. It’s for our supporters, the club and our families.”
