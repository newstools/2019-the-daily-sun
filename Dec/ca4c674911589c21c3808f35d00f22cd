AVOID unnecessary unexpected expenses that can cause a big hole in your wallet. That is the advise to help you get back your financial freedom from Ester Ochse, product head for FNB’s Money Management. She said managing your finances should be a standard priority and should be an ongoing process. “Spending time with our loved ones over the holiday season is exciting; but sometimes our financial circumstances put a damper on the holiday spirit. However, this can be avoided if you manage your finances properly throughout the year,” she said. “Ongoing financial reflection will help identify what has worked and what has not worked for you financially throughout the year. “This enables us to find solutions that will help you better manage your finances, so that you don’t end up in a situation where you cannot enjoy time with your loved ones.” “A list of savings goals will help guide you to draw up your budget. The holiday season is famous for entertainment, family outings and gatherings, short weekend getaways and festive shopping sales. So, ensure that these short-term goals are in your budget,” said Ochse. If you are quite strained financially, look at hosting family get togethers or bring and braai at home together and movie nights instead of going out to help you cut costs and also enjoy your families company.
