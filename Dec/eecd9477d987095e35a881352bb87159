Eskom is starting to play hardball with non-paying
residents of Soweto, Netwerk24 reported on Sunday. The state-owned power utility has
apparently started to cut off the electricity of those who are not paying as
well as anyone who interferes with electricity meters in order to connect to
the grid illegally. Furthermore, fines are issued for "interfering" with
meters. In October Fin24 also reported that
National Treasury had stipulated that Eskom needs to recover all debt owed to
it by errant municipalities, national department and corporations - including
in Soweto.    The flat-rate proposal was the brainchild of the South African National Civic
Organisation – a non-political organisation which advocates on behalf of
communities in engagements with government and other service providers.  Eskom, in turn, foresees that such a
uniform set charge per household would lead to a waste of electricity, according
to Netwerk24. Furthermore, Eskom explained that it is in any event not allowed
to negotiate separate tariffs or make preferential arrangements outside of
tariffs set by the National Energy Regulator (Nersa). Nersa tariffs apply to
all users in the country. Eskom has applied to Nersa for price
hikes of 17.1% for 2019/20, 15.4% for 2020/21 and 15.5% for 2021/22. It argued
that the tariff hike would help it tackle its mounting debt burden, Fin24
previously reported. Nersa has, however, granted Eskom a lower tariff increase,
than what was requested, a decision Eskom now wants to challenge in the North
Gauteng High Court. Eskom claims Nersa's determination has
left it with a shortfall of R102bn. The regulator in March extended tariff
increases of 9.41%, 8.1% and 5.22% to Eskom over three years.
