 The body of
a Hartebeespoort man was recovered on Monday after his car was swept away by
flash floods. According
to National Sea and Rescue Institute (NSRI) Hartbeespoort Dam station commander
Arthur Crewe, the man was travelling with his wife on Sunday when their vehicle
was swept away when they attempted to cross a flooded bridge. Crewe said
they were returning home when the incident happened. "At
20:03, on Sunday, NSRI Hartbeespoort Dam duty crew were activated following
reports from the SRRU [Strategic Response Rescue Unit] of a vehicle swept away
by flash floods from a low-lying bridge on a tributary of the Crocodile River
in Welgegund on the Glen Afriq Estate close to Hartbeespoort Dam. "It is
believed the husband was able to break a window of their vehicle while it was
being swept downstream. The wife was able to escape through it and reached the
riverbank. She raised the alarm at a nearby house where residents activated
their panic alarm. "SRRU
members, an NSRI Hartbeespoort Dam swift water rescue team, NECSA ambulance
services, the SA Police Services, Eagle Towing, CPF members and a police dive
unit responded," said Crewe. During the
search, the submerged vehicle was found 300m downstream. "NSRI
swift water rescue swimmers, Eagle Towing and SRRU members rigged a rope system
across the river and despite the fast-flowing water, the NSRI swift water
rescue swimmers reached the vehicle and were able to confirm that one person
remained in the vehicle. "Police
divers, deployed at the scene, recovered the man from the vehicle and sadly
paramedics declared him dead. During the operation, Eagle Towing members and
their resources provided vital assistance. "The
body of the man has been taken into the care of government health forensic
pathology services. The police have opened an inquest docket," said Crewe. The vehicle
was recovered from the river on Monday morning. SOURCE: NEWS24
