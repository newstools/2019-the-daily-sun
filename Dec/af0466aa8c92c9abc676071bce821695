NTSAKO Mabuza was left with no roof over his head after a fire destroyed his house. The 39-year-old from Blinkwater Village outside Giyani in Limpopo said his house caught fire last Saturday. Ntsako said he didn’t get any help from his neighbours, instead they stood taking videos and pictures of his six-roomed house while it burnt. “I am disabled with only one hand. I was not able to extinguish the fire and the community just stood there and watched,” he said. “I have lost all my household furniture valued at R150 000 which includes a TV, stoves, fridges, beds, decorations on the walls and all important documents.” He told the SunTeam he built the house after he got a pay-out from the Road Accident Fund. Ntsako’s mum, Martha (72), said she was concerned as her son has since started drinking heavily. “We are looking for a Good Samaritan to help rebuild the house. We have tried government, but all our efforts have failed,” she said. Ntsako’s neighbour, Conny Nukeri (63), said she was shocked when other neighbours failed to help put out the fire. “The scenes of that day have not escaped my mind. I was the only one who attempted to help, but it was too late,” said Conny. A neighbour told Daily Sun she couldn’t help as she was not on speaking terms with Ntsako. “He drinks too much and sometimes says rude things to us. I guess that’s why people didn’t help him.” Greater Giyani Municipal spokesman Steven Mabunda said the municipality would try to rebuild Ntsako’s house.
