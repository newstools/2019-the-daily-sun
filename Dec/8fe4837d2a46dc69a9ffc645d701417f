A 42-year-old pastor from Mavambe Village in  Malamule outside Giyani, has today appeared before the Malamulele magistrate's court, after he was arrested yesterday  for raping a 17-year-old girl at his house. Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said it is alleged that the victim visited her pastor's house at about 14:00 in the afternoon, as she often did. On arrival she found him alone and was invited to the study room. During the process, the suspect claimed to have had visions where the victim would be attacked by evil spirits. Mojapelo said he then offered her a cold drink to chase away the demons. Immediately after consuming the drink, the girl allegedly felt drowsy and that's when the suspect dragged her to the children's bedroom and raped her. When the victim arrived at home she informed her parents and the matter was reported to the Police. They promptly responded and case of rape was opened. The suspect was arrested at his house  shortly after the incident. The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba,  has condemned the ongoing sexual violence perpetrated against women and children, which are still occurring frequently in some parts of this  province especially during a time when the nation is observing 16 Days of Activism for  No Violence Against Women and Children.
