Orlando Pirates coach Rhulani Mokwena said the 2-2 draw with Baroka FC on Saturday 'feels like a loss' after his side surrendered a two-goal lead. Pirates led through Linda Mntambo and Kabelo Dlamini but were pegged by back by an own goal from Happy Jele and a Gerald Phiri Jr strike. "Especially when you're [on a ] two-nil lead, it looks and feels like a loss to be honest with you. But we give good games, that's what we do, we gave games with lots of goals, we give good spectacles, so hopefully the crowd enjoyed the spectacle today," Mokwena told SuperSport TV. "We struggled to deal with the set-pieces, the two throw ins, two goals, we have to look at it, dead-ball situations. [But] we scored some very good goals today, goals with good moments and things that we practiced. So sometimes it's just about perspectives and you focus on some of the good things that we're doing and we try to improve on the other things." The Bucs mentor reserved special praise for goalscoring duo Mntambo and Dlamini. "Congratulations to 'Piano' [Linda Mntambo] for Man of the Match again when he comes back, like he played against Highlands Park he won [the] Man of the Match [award] again today, very good display, scored a very good goal and played exceptionally well," said Mokwena. "His [Kabelo Dlamini] mentality is right, he comes in from the bench, he doesn't sulk when he sits on the bench, he's got the right mentality, if you have the right mentality, football rewards you. Congratulations to him also, he did exceptionally well when he came on." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
