ONCE again Gabola Church has taken religion through booze to a new level! Not only are new congregants baptised with booze, they’re welcomed into the House of the Lord with their choice of their favourite drink – anything from whisky, cider and gin, to simple beer. READ: MAN BUYS A BANANA FOR R1,7 MILLION Founder and leader of the church, Tsietsi Makiti, said none of their members wanted to be baptised with water. Gabola Church International Ministries was established four years ago to allow boozers who were rejected from other churches to also worship. Makiti said the church had since grown and was operating in different taverns across the country.  “If I’m not present, baptism is performed by tavern owners who’re either pastors or bishops,” Makiti told Daily Sun. He said a new member was welcomed and chose alcohol of their choice. “They can either choose for the alcohol to be poured on their heads, be put on their heads, or even to drink it,” he said. The age limit for drinking alcohol at Gabola church is 20. The church is strict about responsible drinking and accountability.  He said members testified how their spirits were set free after finding a place of worship that accepted them. “We’re peaceful and joyful during our services,” he said. “Every member understands that even though we consume alcohol we’re still in church. It has changed their behaviour.” READ: SHOMAJOZI'S TWEETS DISAPPOINTS FANS! Last year, the People’s Paper reported that Makiti was working on his Bible. He told the SunTeam recently that funding had been a challenge and that he was looking for sponsors. “We’re strictly against church fees being used to enrich church leaders and enabling them to live a life of luxury while members of the congregation suffer.”
