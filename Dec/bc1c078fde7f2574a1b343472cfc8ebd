NOMVULA Khushube wanted to go home for Christmas to show her family her baby. But the child’s father was worried she’d never return and allegedly killed Nomvula’s daughter from a previous relationship! The 31-year-old from Amaoti, Durban, told Daily Sun her baby daddy killed her three-year-old Madlantshiyana Mavuyo on Thursday after she told him she was going to visit her family in Port St Johns, Eastern Cape. She said she had an eight-month-old baby with the suspect.  “He didn’t have a problem with my child as we’ve been together for two years. I used to visit my family and he didn’t mind,” she said. Nomvula said after they had a baby in April, he started suspecting she’d leave with the child.  Nomvula said when she got back, she found the door locked. “I went to fetch the key from a salon. I found everything upside down. I looked around and saw a small hand underneath the bed. I pulled it and it was my child’s hand. He had strangled her and left with our baby.”  Nomvula screamed for help and the man was found at the taxi rank with the baby. Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was opened by Inanda police. “A 23-year-old man was arrested and will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon.”
