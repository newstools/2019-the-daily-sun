NATIONAL Education and Health and Workers Union members disrupted services at Pietersburg Hospital on Monday. Preventing management from working, they demanded their increases and performance bonuses. They protested at the hospital as Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba was supposed to organise the insourcing of the renal clinic at the hospital. Union regional secretary Moss Maubane said they couldn’t have the department’s co-operative services undermining workers. “Workers were supposed to get their money but instead, got as little as R300 while they expected the least paid workers to get more than R1 000. “That angered the workers, who downed tools after they were paid peanuts by the department. When we spoke to the department’s co-operative services, they failed to assure us when they’d pay the workers.” Maubane said the workers would continue to down tools until the department took them seriously. He said they’d get their money by force because it was theirs. He said workers were being undermined and they wanted to know when their money would be paid into their bank accounts. After the renal clinic was privatised, patients kept complaining doctors weren’t taking care of them. Earlier this year, a renal patient shot a nurse at the clinic and then turned the gun on himself, dying on the spot Department spokesman Neil Shikwambana said the MEC had to leave the unruly workers while she wanted to address them about their challenges. He said the head of department would meet them. “The renal clinic’s official opening will be rescheduled. We’ve taken over management of day-to-day operations to ensure renal services. Although the contractual arrangement ended, the parties continue a working relationship.”
