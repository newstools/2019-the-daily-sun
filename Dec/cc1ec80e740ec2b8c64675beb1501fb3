That was where her son, Siyabonga (10), had drowned while swimming with friends on Saturday. On Christmas Day, her prayers for his body to be found were answered. Nomkhosi told Daily Sun when Siyabonga asked to go play with his friends on Saturday, she didn’t know it would be the last seen she’d see him alive. “I told him to come back home soon, but he didn’t,” she said. “I later got a call from a neighbour telling me Siyabonga had drowned.” She said she was hurting but relieved his body was found. “My worry was that they’d never find him,” she said. Nomkhosi said Siyabonga was going to be in grade 6 next year.  “He was my only son. It hurts me very much that he is gone. “I’m still going to make funeral arrangements,” Nomkhosi said. IPSS medical rescue spokesman Paul Herbst said following intensive search and rescue efforts, the body of Siyabonga was recovered on the fifth day.
