He has not even quit his job. A 42-year old Lotto winner has treated himself to a
second-hand car after scooping a £105million (over R171b) jackpot. EuroMillions winner Steve Thomson says flashy motors are
a 'waste of money' and is continuing to work because if makes him 'feel
normal'. The UK man and his wife, 41-year-old Lenka, have only
bought a pre-owned car since they won last month. Thomson told Mirror Online that the jackpot set him on an
'emotional rollercoaster' he described as 'very stressful' and leaving him
struggling to sleep. He said that going back to work part-time was his way of
coping with the situation. 'I feel normal and that’s how I want to stay,' he said. 'I’m trying to finish some jobs before Christmas.  'I won’t be able to finish all of them, but I’m doing
what I can between meetings.' Lenka, who has three children with Steven, has already
quit her job at a convenience store near their home in Selsey, West Sussex. But Steve said he'll finish the work he's started because
he can't go back on his word. He admitted that the newfound wealth still hasn't sunk
in, but that the family will be moving from their three-bedroom house so that
their children can each had bedrooms of their own. Before they move out of the £120,000 property, Steve says
that Christmas is the main priority. He says he'll only be able to enjoy the cash when he
knows that his family, friends and community are happy.
