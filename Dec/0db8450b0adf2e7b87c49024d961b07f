Gogo told Daily Sun: “Respect for people and God have added fruitful years to my life. I have lived life to the fullest.” Madikabiso said through the years she had advised many people when they were going through tough times. “When someone says, ‘bless you’, you must embrace it. That will definitely add rewards to your life. It might not be a longer life, but it will brighten your life.” Gogo said she was happy with the way she grew up. “It taught me ways of dealing with life and those characteristics were passed on to my kids and grandchildren,” she said. “My parents were very strict but I have realised they were teaching me manners.” She had 11 kids but seven have since died. Now she’s left with four daughters. She has 34 grandchildren, 46 great-grandkids and 12 great-great grandkids. Her family said the gogo was their pillar of strength, and they were grateful for all the things she taught them. Her daughter, Mamitahli Miya (58), said her mum used to be hard on them.
