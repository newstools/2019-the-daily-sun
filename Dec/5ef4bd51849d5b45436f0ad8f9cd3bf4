Top flutist and businessman C’nky Siwela took the good with the bad this year as he reflects on his major moments. The internationally acclaimed musician cited starting his own record label C’well Music and Media as one of the main achievements of 2019 although he did it without a strong financial injection. “I decided to start my own business this year, it was something I’ve been contemplating for a while. Although I came without the financial backing I have though,” he said. He added that forming the company enabled him to meet different people who helped by advising him what to do and not to do. “I also do music workshops and I like those because I help emerging artists to get their careers started.” He also revealed that he was working with young Isicathamiya group Imbizo Messengers. “It is an electro song with a new twist, the song is not done yet hence I can’t announce the title.”
