After fueling pregnancy rumours in November, Itumeleng Khune's partner Sphelele Makhunga has finally revealed that she is indeed expecting. The model shared a photo on Christmas day of herself cloaked in red material while cradling her growing baby bump.   "A Merry Christmas to you and yours from Us [sic]," she wrote, adding: "Our Christmas Gift from God." Talks of Sphelele's pregnancy came shortly after Itumeleng had allegedly paid lobola for the model. According to Sphelele, she once dated Itumeleng for a year before rekindling their romance again in early 2019. A Merry Christmas to you and yours from Us ????
