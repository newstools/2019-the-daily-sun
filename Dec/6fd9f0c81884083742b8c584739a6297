New York, USA - A performance artist who ate a banana taped to a wall that was an artwork valued at $120,000 (R1,7 million) said his actions were not vandalism. The piece by artist Maurizio Cattelan, called “Comedian”, was taped to a wall at the Art Basel in Miami Beach, Florida. Performance artist David Datuna joined the crowd taking selfies with the banana on Saturday, and then pulled off the tape and ate the banana in a video widely shared on social media. “First of all, I respect this artist. For me, he’s one of the top artists in the world,” Datuna said. “I think this is the first time in art history when one artist eats the concept for another artist. People ask me, you eat banana? Physically, it was a banana but a banana is just a tool. So usually I eat the concept of the art.” – REUTERS
