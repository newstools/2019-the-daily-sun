Former Mamelodi Sundowns attacker, George Lebese has sealed a move to United Soccer League (USL) Championship side the Colorado Springs Switchbacks, the club announced on Friday. The 30-year-old who has signed for the upcoming season will be aiming for a fresh start after struggling to secure a move in the Absa Premiership. "It's a great honour and blessing to be given this opportunity to join the Switchbacks family," Lebese said. "I can’t extend my sincere gratitude and above all, I just want to thank God for everything." He joins fellow South African head coach Alan Koch at the Switchbacks who revealed his excitement at sealing a deal for the Bafana Bafana international. "George is a player that we are incredibly excited about. He is in need of a fresh opportunity after many years of success in the South African Premier League. We look forward to supporting him and helping get his confidence back," Koch said. "When George is flowing, the team is flowing. He is going to be an integral part of our new-look team and he has the ability to unlock the opposition’s defence through his vision and passing ability." Lebese has made 157 Absa Premiership appearances while donning the colours of teams such as Kaizer Chiefs, SUndowns and SuperSport United scoring 24 goals. The USL Championship is a Division II professional men's soccer league consisting of 35 teams from Eastern and Western Conferences. The Switchbacks who are affiliated to MLS side the Colorado Rapids finished last season in 18th position. -Sport24
