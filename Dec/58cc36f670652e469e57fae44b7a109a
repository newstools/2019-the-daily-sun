WHEN her friend dropped her off at home after a night out on Friday, her boyfriend was convinced she’d been out with another man. He allegedly responded by beating her up and setting her alight! According to what she told her family before she died, Nontokozo Khumalo (40) was dragged into her shack and viciously attacked. Her sister Valentine (27) told Daily Sun: “He locked the shack before he beat her. She later told us he poured paraffin on her and left her to burn. We saw her shack was on fire after hearing her cry for help.”  Valentine said residents of Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, had to break down her sister’s shack to get to her. She was rushed to hospital but later died from serious burn wounds.  Her other sister Nelisiwe (30) said: “We don’t understand why he didn’t leave and look for another woman instead of killing our sister. Nontokozo was in so much pain. We hope he’s found so he can explain.” The family said the cops were not doing enough to arrest the suspect. The sisters said they had not heard anything from the cops in almost a week. Nontokozo’s brutal murder comes at the end of a year that saw scores of women being killed by abusive partners. A case of murder was being investigated by cops at Daveyton Police Station.
