 THE North West
Mbahare Kekana Mamusa Local Municipality is sitting at 78% unemployment. This according
to the leader of Forum 4 Service Delivery (F4SD). This is a
challenge the party leader aims to tackle should they take over the
municipality in the next elections. He was
addressing party members in Schweizer-Reneke at a door to door campaign at the
Mamusa Local Municipality Ward 6 where he also introduced councillor
candidates. The campaign
aims to attract voters for the January 2020 elections which will see the
winning party take over Mamusa. The elections
come after the party was dissolved by North West Premier Job Mokgoro in
October. The municipality
has previously been placed under administration which yielded no positive results
and led to it being dissolved. Mbahare said
the cause of the high rates of unemployment is due to a lack of youth
programmes available. He said proper
planning needs to be done to decrease such social ills. He said it was
time to make Mamusa great again but added that it cannot be done without the
community votes. "The
results of 15 January are going to give us an idea of 2021. It is a pre-test
because these elections are watched by the whole country. Because Mamusa in the
North West is the first local municipality to be dissolved because of political
uncertainty," he said. The F4SD
leader said the success of the party in taking over Mamusa depends on how the hard
party members work. He said the
same old food parcel hand out is going to be repeated.
