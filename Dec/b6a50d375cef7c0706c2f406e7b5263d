THIS Miss Bachelorette SA finalist wants to be young women’s role model. Passionate Mpho Nyangintsimbi (28) from Hammanskraal said: “I’m all about redefining empowerment. I started a support group for young mothers called Hashtag Babymama Rise.” Miss Bachelorette SA is a women empowerment project recognising and empowering unmarried and independent women aged 25 to 50 through charity, fashion and beauty. It had groomed her in many ways.  “It made me realise how the happiness of other people is important to me, especially when it comes to women.” She said the project’s main focus was to fight women abuse and inspire women and young girls to see the importance of being financially and emotionally independent. The medical technologist is the founder of Nyangis Foundation, which donates sanitary pads and uniforms to poor pupils. The challenge she faced was getting women to speak out about abuse.  “Some do but never report their abusers. An abuser needs to face the law.” Mpho told Daily Sun she planned to have a facility to counsel women. “I’ll host business seminars, mentorship programmes. I also want to have a daycare centre for kids of the victims.”
