THREE departments are working together to help storm victims in the Harry Gwala district in KZN. Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka, Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza and Human Settlements MEC Peggy Nkonyeni visited families affected by the storms. They donated blankets, groceries and cosmetics to 308 families in the Ubuhlebezwe, Umzimkhulu and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma areas. Khoza said: “Social workers from my department will assist the families who lost their IDs and other important documents by taking them to the relevant departments.” Resident Rose Mcinza (43) said she was grateful for the donation.  “I got groceries for my five family members. I stay with my neighbour whose house was severely damaged, so we were given enough food for all of us,” she said. Thandi Nkabane (38) said all her food was damaged by the rain, but she was grateful the MEC donated food for her family of five. “The day was a tragedy for us, but we’re grateful for the food and cosmetics,” she said.  “Christmas will forever be a reminder of my son’s death. It’s painful and hard to believe he is gone.”  KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed an inquest docket was opened after a man was killed by lightning.
