MTV Base’s annual hottest MCs list is always followed by some controversy, fans and artists were not impressed last year, and there is nothing different this year either. Every year, MTV compiles and releases its "Hottest MCs list" of the year. The title went to rapper and songwriter, Kwesta, in 2018 with rapper Nadia Nakai holding the 10th spot. Fans were angered last year that A-Reece, YoungstaCPT, and Emtee did not make the list, and this time Cassper Nyovest is leading the unhappy pack. This marks the second year of Nadia holding the 10th spot, a revelation that has angered the Monate Mpolaye hitmaker. Despite the strives the rapper has made this year, releasing her first album, Nadia Naked, and winning her first major award, alongside Nasty C, Sjava and the AFRIMA, the channel still does not recognise her. READ: NADIA CONQUERS AFRICA The list is always compiled by a panel of hip-hop insiders, and thus far they have not revealed the top 5. It has Nakai at 10, K.O at nine, Riky Rick at eight, Shane Eagle at seven and Sho Madjozi at six. Cassper Nyovest has said that South African hip-hop has never loved him or any artist from Maftown. On a social media rant, Cassper is standing by Nadia’s side and slamming MTV. This time around, he has all his fans behind him, some called the list an insult to musicians.   Cassper has a lot on his plate as he prepares to fill up the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg, which he has shared that he has been struggling to find sponsors. From today, the star has three days to go till the anticipated concert, and he has shared the sweetest motivation from his mother.
