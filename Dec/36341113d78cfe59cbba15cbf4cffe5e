GOSPEL great Sipho “Big Fish” Makhabane has come out guns blazing against men who abuse women. “Such men are cowards. You persuaded her to love you. What stops you from fixing things the way you did when pursuing her?” he said. He said it’s evil when men beat, rape and kill women. “It has to stop, and it has to stop today,” he said. He said as an ambassador chosen by the Mpumalanga premier to lead the fight against violence on women, he wanted men to hear the message loud and clear. “We’re not just saying men should stop abusing women and children during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence, but forever,” said Big Fish. “When you wake up, look in the mirror and say, ‘Today I’ll protect my woman’,” he said. Big Fish said men should know their role in society. “If you beat a woman, what are you teaching a young boy? “If someone abuses a woman in your presence, don’t keep quiet.” Big Fish said they had arranged a huge prayer day to take place at Mbombela Stadium next Saturday. “We want all artists, religious leaders, political leaders and the public to come together so we can pray about this.”
