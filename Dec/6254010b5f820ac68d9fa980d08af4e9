WITH days to go before a snap election, last Friday’s deadly terror attack has pushed law and order to the top of the British political agenda. Police said Usman Khan, who went on the rampage at a conference on criminal rehabilitation near the London Bridge, killing two people, had been previously convicted on terrorism charges but released early from prison. Wearing a fake suicide vest and wielding knives, the 28-year-old Briton was wrestled to the ground by bystanders before being shot dead by police. Khan was convicted in 2012 for his part in an al-Qaeda-inspired plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange, police said on Saturday. He was, however, released in December last year subject to conditions. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, criticised government’s sentencing policies. “There’s got to be a very full investigation,” said Corbyn, who’s seeking to depose Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the 12 December vote. “I think there’s also a question about what the probation service were doing ... and whether the parole board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released in the first place,” he said. Johnson said the attack was a terrorist act and vowed to act. “I have long said that this system simply isn’t working,” he said after visiting the scene. Those convicted of a serious terrorism offence should face a mandatory minimum sentence of 14 years, he said later. Islamic State said the attack was carried out by its fighter in response to calls to target countries that had been part of an antijihadists coalition, according to Amaq news agency. – REUTERS
