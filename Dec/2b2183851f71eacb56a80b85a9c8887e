KAIZER Chiefs have stretched their winning run in the Absa Premiership to eight matches in a row. This after they thrashed Bloemfontein Celtic 5-3 in a thrilling encounter played at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, in Durban on Saturday. Samir Nurkovic was the star of the show, scoring an impressive hat trick to help Amakhosi regain their ten point lead at the top of the Premiership standings. The 27-year-old was unstoppable, proving a consistent thorn in the side of Phunya Sele Sele. Celtic, to their credit, did not make things easy for Amakhosi as they gave them a huge scare in the first half. They took the lead three times in a frantic first half, however, they could not hold on to it on every occasion. Ndumiso Mabena opened the scoring for Celtic early in the first half, but Nurkovic would equalise soon after. His strike partner Harris Tchilimbou then restored Celticâ€™s lead, but that man again, Nurkovic, was on hand to level with a diving header. And when Siphelele Luthuli made it three for Celtic, there were little doubts on whether Chiefs would manage to claw their way back again. However, they had to wait until the second half, with Leonardo Castro joining the party as he popped up with the equaliser. Chiefs then ran away with proceedings with Nurkovic completing his hat trick before Castro put the cherry on top with the fifth.
