JABULANI Baloyi was a breadwinner, father and a husband. Over the weekend, fellow taximen honoured his memory by making sure his family would not be left in the cold. On Saturday, the government and the SA Taxi Association gave his family in Soshanguve, Tshwane, a brand - new minibus taxi. The family was left with no income after Jabulani was shot dead in August, allegedly by a drug dealer he had confronted.  Mpho said her husband was a loving man who took care of his family. He had three daughters with Mpho, and a 27-year-old from a previous relationship. Family spokesman Hlamalani Baloyi-Jele said: “The Quantum will bring income for the family.”  Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo said: “We wanted to tell the family we’re here for them and we wanted to have lunch with them.” Maroba Maduma of the SA Taxi Association said they were grateful for Jabulani’s bravery. “This small gesture shows we appreciate his bravery, and his family must not feel we didn’t see what he did,” he said.
