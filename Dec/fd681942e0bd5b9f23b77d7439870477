  A self-confessed killer was sad when he heard that he will spend his first
Christmas in jail after his bail hearing was postponed again.  The 21-year old from Agincourt Village outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge,
Mpumalanga appeared before Mhala Magistrates Court on Thursday. He wasn't asked to plead on the murder charge and has been in custody since
June after he allegedly confessed to his mother that he killed his girlfriend
Nokulunga Mbatha (22) who was originally from KZN. Her body was found stashed in a suite case and buried in his
backyard. But the state pleaded with the court to work with cops on speeding up the
finalisation of the DNA results from the forensic lab.  Prosecutor Musa Makhubele told the court the state is still waiting for DNA
results to confirm the deceased body which its handled at forensic lab in
Pretoria. "We have agreed with the defence lawyer that a new bail hearing be moved
to 28 January 2020," said Makhubele. Magistrate Tanya du Preez postponed the case to 28 January after the state
requested a postponement.
