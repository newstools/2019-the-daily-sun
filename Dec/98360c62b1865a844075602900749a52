HUNDREDS of gospel singers made their way to the Mpumalanga Gospel Music Awards on Sunday, but not all of them left the ceremony smiling! Gospel artists were frustrated after their categories were apparently not announced. READ: BENJAMIN DUBE: HE WASN'T A PROPHET, BUT HE WAS DEEP! The awards ceremony was held on Sunday at AFM Communio Church in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. According to a source, at least two categories were not announced. “There were a lot of mistakes during the awards and they forgot to announce the winners of the Best ZCC and Best Amadodana albums. We all thought they would announce them later on,” said the source. Daily Sun was reliably told the forgotten artists went backstage, but CEO Sandile Ngobe apparently didn’t have the right answers for the artists. Victor Seabata, a fan ?at the awards, said on Facebook: “Mpumalanga gospel awards were a disaster from the start. No formal apology as yet.”  He said he was disappointed. “With all the investment done by each group, this can’t be normal,” he said. Wacha Mkhukhu Wachumlilo of The Gospel of Nkosana – Music that Heals, who were nominated in the Best ZCC album category wrote that the awards made a mockery of themselves.  “They seem to have forgotten about two categories. Even the CEO can’t explain what happened.”  Awards CEO Sandile Ngobe told Daily Sun: “This was the first time that the awards were broadcast live and we obviously had problems.” Ngobe said they were aware some categories were not announced. “We are in touch with the respective winners and working on a way to solve the problem. We are really sorry that this happened,” he said.
