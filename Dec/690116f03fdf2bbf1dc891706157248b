DEFENCE and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has condemned the theft of military weapons! The incident happened at the South African National Defence Force’s Lyttelton TEK Base in Tshwane on Monday. Mapisa-Nqakula said 11 suspects were identified and taken in for questioning after the break-in. This was after 19 R4 automatic rifles, issued only to soldiers, were stolen. The minister said she was in constant consultation with the defence force chief on the matter. “He said he is confident the current investigations will yield the required results and that all perpetrators will be subjected to all applicable criminal laws,” said Mapisa-Nqakula. It was also reported the minister instructed the defence force to cancel all leave for Military Command Council members, including the relevant command structures at all levels, to ensure all key infrastructure of the army throughout the country was secured. The minister said the outcome of the investigations would be communicated once completed. DA’s defence spokesman Kobus Marais, said: “It is outrageous to even consider that access could be gained into a supposedly highly protected military facility and further grind open a volt where ammunition is kept. “Having such arms on the streets poses a threat to the safety of citizens and the security of the republic.”
