Television personality Ayanda Thabethe has added her voice on the Black Coffee and Enhle Mbali drama. She is of the view that when a partner cheats in a marriage, he is the one that should vacate the house, not the wife and kids. Taking to Twitter, the star wrote: "Am I wrong to think that if you’re the party that has cheated in a marriage that you need not disturb my life and that you should leave me in my house with my kids . I don’t care if you’re paying for it". Ayanda's opinion follows Black Coffee's interview with City Press last week, in which he revealed that he asked Enhle to vacate the their matrimonial home and find a place to live with the kids. He was further quoted saying that he would foot the bill for the house Enhle would move into. .
