FELICIA Shabangu’s family said the delay in receiving DNA results from her body brought more misery. A body, believed to be that of the 17-year-old was found in Julius Mndawe’s backyard in Masoyi, Mpumalanga, earlier this year. Felicia’s dad Moses Ndlovu (55) said no one was willing to tell the family what was going on as they still hadn’t buried her. Felicia was among five young women, aged between 15 and 24, found buried in Mndawe’s backyard after he allegedly confessed to killing them.  He allegedly killed them between 2017 and last year. The 25-year-old faces charges of rape, murder, concealment of death, violation of a corpse and concealment of bodies. He handed himself in to cops after the cellphone of one of the victims was found in his possession. Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the DNA of two of the girls couldn’t be detected. “We understand the trauma both families are facing. But we’re asking them to be patient since the team is still busy,” he said.
