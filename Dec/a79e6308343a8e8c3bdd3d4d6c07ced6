AMAPIANO singer Lediboo claims DJ Maphorisa and Kabza De Small stole her song. The singer, whose real name is Naledi Tsenasi, said she was shocked when she heard her debut single Tlhomela renamed Sandton on DJ Maphorisa and Kabza De Small’s EP, The Return of the Scorpion Kings. Lediboo said she recorded the song with Khumo MRD of Team Mosha.  “I went to Khumo in September and asked him to help me record this song. A month after recording it, he sent it back to me,” she said. “I wasn’t happy with the song and he said he’d speak to DJ Maphorisa and maybe he could help out.  “We went to Maphorisa’s house in Midrand and recorded in October. He said he’d send the song to Khumo and me via WhatsApp, but didn’t.” Lediboo said she was listening to the The Return of the Scorpion Kings after it was released at the end of last month.     “When I heard my song on their EP I contacted Khumo to let him know, and he said he’d call Maphorisa. I tried calling him but he blocked me. “I’m disappointed because I know these people, especially Kabza. They need to credit me for my song. The chorus they used is what is making people love the song and I should also get paid.” Khumo didn’t want to comment, saying he was trying to maintain relationships in the industry. DJ Maphorisa and Kabza didn’t respond to calls or texts. Their legal adviser, Katlego Malatji, said: “It’s the first time I’m hearing about this, so I’d have to talk to Naledi and hear her case.”
