SHE’S a three-yeas-old active child, who seems to be a genius. Ibanathi Mpungose, a pupil at Grace Chapel creche in Mpophomeni in Howick, KZN, knows all the Mzansi’s A-list celebrities and politicians, and she can identify their photos in an instant. She can count from one to 100, knows all the months of the year and can recite them in both Zulu and English. She also knows all the body parts in both languages. “I learnt how to count in school and our teacher also taught us the body parts. I enjoy going to school as I learn so many things.” Ibanathi may be clever, but she’s also a normal child. She loves pizza, hamburgers, steak, chocolate and Ultra Mel custard. “I want to be a doctor when I grow up,” she said. Amanda Ntshangase (22), Ibanathi’s mother, said she noticed her child was different when she was only one. “I was surprised. Not only was she walking but she was already talking and dancing,” said Amanda. “Her energy is scary. Where does she learn all these things?” Amanda said she doesn’t live with her full-time, but they talk every day and they visit often. “She was in grade RRR for only a few days when she was promoted to grade RR. She already knew most of the things.” Amanda’s started doing videos for her Facebook page. “People recognise her everywhere she goes.” Amanda told Daily Sun when they were at the mall in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands, recently people were greeting her, taking photos with her and screaming. “She whispered in my ear that people are screaming for her because she’s a celebrity,” said Amanda.
