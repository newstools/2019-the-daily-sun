Police Minister Bheki Cele says Limpopo has 14 000 shebeens and 42 churches, but I beg to differ. CELE TO LIMPOPO: ‘THIS IS A DRUNK PROVINCE!’ Minister Cele, do you know Limpopo is the headquarters of Africa’s biggest churches? The province alone has more than 3,5 million members of two churches. It’s impossible that those are the only churches in the whole province. Stop misleading people.  Those headquarters are there for a purpose. - Letter by TL Marbela, in Mayfield
