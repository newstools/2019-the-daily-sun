MAMELODI Sundowns' Mauricio "AMA UBER" Affonso scored two goals that resulted in the Brazilians lifting the 2019 Telkom Knockout trophy 2-1 against Maritzburg United on Saturday night. Said Affonso after the game: "I am very happy that we won the trophy because it was a difficult game. To score two goals was incredible. Fortunately we won the game." Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane praised Affonso and said that the reason why he signed him is because he needed a different option upfront. Said Mosimane: "Mauricio really came to the party. I wanted someone who would give me something different because of his height. He is not fit and we've been struggling to get him fit but his height is his strength. He is not Mshishi (Themba Zwane) or Sirino (Gaston) but he will put you to sleep and he will pounce and score. And that is why we needed him for the CAF Champions League."
