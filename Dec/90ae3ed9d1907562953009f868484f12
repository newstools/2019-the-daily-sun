Black Leopards coach Luc Eymael has confirmed he has quit the club, but did not give reasons for his departure after only three months in the job. Eymael made the announcement on Friday, saying only that it was for personal reasons. "I would like to thanks Black Leopards for accepting my resignation for personal reasons," he said. "Thanks to all the players who did their best, to my staff too and especially to the fantastic fans who will remain in my heart. I wish the club all the best for the second [half of the season]." Eymael, who had worked previously at Polokwane City and Free State Stars, leading the latter to the Nedbank Cup title in 2018, joined Leopards in late September, replacing Frenchman Lionel Soccoia. He coached the side in nine games in all competitions, with three wins, three draws and three defeats. The side currently lie in 11th position on the Absa Premiership table, three points above the relegation zone.
