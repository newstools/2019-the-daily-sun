THE high incidents of gender-based violence have become a concern for Mzansi’s communities. Government departments are creating awareness campaigns to tackle this problem. Yesterday, Gauteng Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko joined Orange Farm residents in prayer to mark the end of 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence. Police and members of different churches attended the prayer session. According to the department, Orange Farm, south of Joburg, is one of the areas that has high levels of crimes against women and children. Gauteng is sitting at 226 sexual offence cases and 204 rape cases, reported in the 2018/19 financial year. Said Councillor Lucky Mbuso: “Our people must work with cops to help solve these cases. Let’s stand together as a community.” Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela said the prayer session would help police understand where such cases happened. MEC Mazibuko said: “We applaud cops for doing a good job in fighting these crimes.”
