CHRISTOPHER Mathebula (36) will spend Christmas behind bars. The trial of the ex-offender who was denied bail in October was postponed to next month. Mathebula from White City Village outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, appeared before Magistrate Tanya du Preez in the Mhala Magistrates Court yesterday. PRISON SECURITY BEEFED-UP THIS FESTIVE! He’s accused of raping a mentally ill woman in August. During his appearance in October, he pleaded not guilty to the rape charge. When the crime allegedly happened, Mathebula was out on parole. He was sentenced to 30 years in jail for robbery in 2002 and was released in 2015. The court heard the 31-year-old victim was alone in the house after her sister took her child to creche. When the suspect realised the sister had left, he allegedly went to the victim’s house and took her to his house, where he raped her. The victim came out of the house crying and told a neighbour she’d been raped. BOY (12) GETS BEHIND THE WHEEL AND DRIVES TO FLEE FIRE! The neighbour informed the sister, who later reported the matter to the police. Prosecutor Musa Makhubele told the court the police docket had been transferred to the regional court prosecutor, who still needed outstanding evidence from the police. “We asked the matter to be postponed in order for the police to finalise the requested evidence before the trial date can be arranged,” said Makhubele. Du Preez postponed the case to 28 January for further investigation. She ordered the accused to remain in police custody after his bail was denied.
