MARITZBURG UNITED coach Eric Tinkler has done all he could to avoid talks about the Telkom Knockout final. The former Orlando Pirates coach said he’ll only talk about the TKO final this coming weekend. The Team of Choice aim to win their first ever knockout trophy in the PSL era when they face Mamelodi Sundowns at Moses Mabhida Stadium this coming Saturday. In what will be a prep match, Maritzburg will face Polokwane City in a league match today (3.30pm) at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium. One of the club’s star players in the TKO semi-final win over Kaizer Chiefs, Dan Morgan, has highlighted the importance of winning this game before the acid test against the Tshwane giants. “It’s important to collect the three points, whether you have been winning every game or not. Everyone wants to win,” said the New Zealand international. “It’s important for us to pick up the three points, especially ahead of the Telkom final. “We haven’t been playing badly in any of these four league matches despite not winning. “The problem is we haven’t been taking our chances while creating many of them.” Tinkler, who won the TKO before with Cape Town in 2016 in what was his first as a head coach, said the Rise and Shine encounter will give him an idea on who he’ll select in the final. Interestingly, when Tinkler won the second trophy in his coaching career with SuperSport United in 2017, the MTN8 trophy, it was also at Moses Mabhida Stadium where the TKO final will be played. Also, the last time Maritzburg were at the venue were on the winning side. They beat AmaZulu and relegated them at the same time in the last game of the 2014/15 season. The Midlands club have also knocked Sundowns out in the last two cup competitions (the MTN8 quarter final in 2017/18 and Nedbank Cup semi-final in the same season). When Sundowns won the TKO in 2015, their last domestic competition, it was also at the same venue as they defeated Chiefs.
