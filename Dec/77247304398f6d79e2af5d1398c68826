THE Sefalis have opened their RDP for residents to use as a safe space. Pharie Sefali (31) from Nyanga, Cape Town, told Daily Sun her family started a project called Lulibo to help the community. “Anyone with problems such as abuse, or those who want to use the internet, can come,” she said. “Nyanga is famous for all the wrong reasons, and the only people who can change that are residents.” Pharie’s brother Phiello said kids could do their homework there. “We want people to know they can come here and share their problems. If they’re being abused, we’re here for them,” he said. “We want to change how people see Nyanga. Most are afraid to come here. They don’t want to get raped or killed.” He said men in Nyanga needed to come together and talk about abuse and rape. Resident John Klaas was grateful. “This shows that this doesn’t have to be the murder capital,” said John. He said he’d never have thought someone would give up their house. “I don’t think anyone would have done what they did. “What they did shows that they’re concerned about what’s happening in Nyanga and want to see change.”
