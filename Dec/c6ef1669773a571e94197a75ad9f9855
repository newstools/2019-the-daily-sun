 FOR A month,
residents of Refilwe and other surrounding areas have been without water! The recent flash
floods made matters worse when an influx of water flooded the Cullinan Wastewater
Treatment Plant and broke it. As a result, it
was temporarily closed. Although the City
of Tshwane supplied water in tanks, it was not enough, and residents lodged
complaints. On Thursday MEC of
Co-operative Governance and Human Settlement in Gauteng, Lebogang Maile, had a
meeting with residents at Refilwe Community Hall to assure them that they will
get more water. The MEC went to
see the water tankers and engaged with residents. He said they are
working on making sure that each street gets two water tanks. The MEC also
handed over 55 tanks as part of the relief to the water crisis in Refilwe. "Magalies
Water and Rand Water are already fixing the damage caused by floods on the
plant and dam and they also looking at other options that will make sure that
residents get water," he said. He said money has
already been allocated for the provision of water. "What is
important is that residents must get water and the cost does not matter. “We are making
sure that there isn’t a water or sanitation crisis," he said. Resident, Moipone
Malatji (42), said the MEC should have been followed by water trucks. "Refilwe is
now the new Hammanskraal, the tanks are not enough and are not filled often, he
should have come here with tanks and put them on every street," she said. She said before
the floods, they were having water problems already. "I don't know
what is wrong with government these days, everything is falling apart. “Water is life
they should fix treatment plants as often as possible," she said. Another Resident,
Seberuberu Kgapola (29) said those who are working never get water. "The few
tanks are filled in the afternoon while we are at work, when we get home they
are empty. “We are forced to
buy expensive water," she said.
