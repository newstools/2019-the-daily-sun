Angel’s teacher at El-Shaddai Christian School, Kantshe Mokanyane, said the young girl was a star in class. “Angel told me stories every Monday about what happened in church. “She was outstanding in her studies. She knew everything. “She was a very smart kid who topped all her classmates in their subjects. We expected a lot from her,” she said. Mpho Mofukunyane, a teacher who facilitated athletics, said Angel placed the school in high positions in the region when it came to athletics. “I knew Angel during the athletic season.
