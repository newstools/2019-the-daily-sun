Paulo and Leah have lived together for 20 years. He said he didn’t know what caused the trouble. But he believed a curse made the women fight over him. Paulo said his mum never loved Leah. He said they were blessed with a son, Tseko Long (20), but his wife and mum never sat around the same fire. “I thought it would get better but it’s taking forever. They’re always fighting. “When I’m not home my wife can’t stay there. They’re peaceful people but they can’t live together,” he told Daily Sun. Gogo said she wished her son had married a different woman. “I don’t hate my daughter-in-law, but I love my son. I’ll have a birthday party and pray there will be love between us so Leah can be the MC.” Leah wouldn’t go into detail about the fighting, but she said she loves her husband.
