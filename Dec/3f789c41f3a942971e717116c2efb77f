WE have seen Christmas trees and decorations in and around
houses before. But this man took Christmas decorations to another level.  One driver in the UK has certainly found a novel way to spread joy to fellow commuters - by covering their car in thousands of twinkling Christmas lights. Daily Mail reports that the unusual car was spotted during a stop at a service station in Raynes Park, London. After filling up, the black Land Rover - which even sported LED lights along its high aerial - pulled out of the service station and joined the A3 to London. The vibrant 4x4 might well be the best-decorated festive vehicle on the roads in the UK, though its certainly not the only one to have attracted attention from surprised road users.In 2017,Â  a young motorist from Canberra, Australia, spent 40 hours attaching 20,000 fairy lights to his Hyundai Santa Fe.  Jordan Wallace had previously placed 10,000 lights on his Holden Astra in 2016 and told Daily Mail Australia that he was inspired by a similar car he saw during Christmas as a child.
