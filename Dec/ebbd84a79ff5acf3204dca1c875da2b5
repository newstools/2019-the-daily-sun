After their much publicised marriage and separation, the Siko twins are praying for one man to love them both. Identical twins, Owami and Olwethu, became well-known after going on a talk show to talk about their marriage to Mzukiseni Mzazi. READ: TWINS DUMP HUSBAND! The twins received criticism from the public but didn't care, but unfortunately the marriage to TV director Mzukiseni Mzazi ended. The 29-year-old twins from Roodepoort confessed that their husband used to abuse them. "He poured diesel over the house but couldn’t find matches. If he had we’d be dead today. We fear he might end up doing something bad to us,” they told Daily Sun in November. Speaking to W24, the twins revealed that they are not looking to date other twins and should they find a man who is only interested in one of them, they would decline the offer because, “You either take both of us or neither”.

Mzazi is the only man they have ever been with intimately and they both have 7-year-old girls from their marriage.
