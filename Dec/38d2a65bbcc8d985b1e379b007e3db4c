UZALO actors opened their hearts to those in need. Nkanyiso Makhanya, Thuthuka Mthembu, Thobani Nzuza and Wiseman Mncube donated groceries to five families in Ulundi, KZN, over the weekend. RAGE OVER KFC WEDDING! Wiseman, who plays Sibonelo on the soapie, said the groceries included rice, mealie meal, a bag of potatoes and meat. “We have to share with poor communities,” he said. He told  Daily Sun   this was his Ikhaya Lamaqhawe Foundation’s first project. He said he planned to donate to the poor every year. He said the actors were funded by the Zululand Municipality. “This was a dream come true as I’ve always wanted to give back to the community. The process was emotional but it was great to see their smiles,” he said. G-STRING CURSE, THEN DEATH! Wiseman thanked his business mentor, Mzamo Zwane, for the role he had played in his life. Thuthuka, who plays Nonka, said she was honoured to have been part of the initiative. “It’s a good cause and it’s always great to help others,” she said. “I want to thank the young people for touching our lives. They made us feel loved,” she said.
