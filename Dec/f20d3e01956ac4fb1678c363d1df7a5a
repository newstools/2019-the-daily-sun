PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa’s intention to free 14 000
prisoners through pardons is a slap on the faces of the victims of crime. One Sunday, Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola announced that
a total 14 674 inmates were eligible for special remission. AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dlindyebo and #FeesMustFall activist
Khaya Cekeshe are some of the inmates who are eligible for the special remission. This came across as good news to many, but the DA cites
that the special remission are a reversal of the work and efforts done by
police and prosecutors. DA’s MP Glynnis Breytenbach said in a statement, “Prosecutors
work equally tirelessly under severe constraints to prosecute those cases in an
effort to make South Africa a safer place for all. The fruits of their hard
labour are now to be rewarded by “special remissions” for over 14 000 convicted
criminals.” She added, “The slap in the face that this reckless,
foolhardy approach represents to the literally thousands of South Africans who
fall victim to crime on a daily basis, cannot be overstated.” Breytenbach said, the result of this indefensible action
by the President, ably supported by his Minister, is the release of, inter
alia, Cekeshe, who set fire to a Police vehicle during protest action, thereby
destroying already scarce police resources, and King, Dalindyebo, who is
serving a 12-year sentence for serious offence including arson, culpable
homicide, assault GBH and kidnapping. “Attempts by both to secure their release through legal
proceedings have been exhausted and have resulted in failure. “This announcement by the President will result in an
excess of 14 000 criminals being released in order to provide “cover” for the
release of these two and other politically expedient “pardons”. “In both cases, the politically motivated decision to
secure their release at all costs has been frustrated by due process, since
simply put, neither meet the legal criteria for release,” she said.
