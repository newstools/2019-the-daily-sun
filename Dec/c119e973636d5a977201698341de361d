 The
serious battle of flames between DJ Zinhle's Umlilo and DJ Big Sky's Fire
is on this festive season. Music
fans are wondering which of the popular songs will cause an inferno as a cross
over song to the New Year. This week, DJ Zinhle celebrated
the success of her song reaching platinum status. At the beginning of the month
she posted on Twitter that prayers needed to be sent to those who do not
believe that Umlilo, featuring Muzzle and Rethabile, was this year’s
song of the year.   She said according to the love it is getting on
social media, this would be the cross over song. Shen then ended the post with
Fire! After the release of Fire
by Big Sky and Luude DJ featuring Sbhanga, DJ Zinhle has a serious contender
and she also acknowledges that by mentioning fire on her post beside the song
having the same titles, they are both a breath of fresh air considering the
high rotation of Amapiano. The big question is however, are both songs hot
enough to be the cross over song? .   Watch: DJ Zinhle, Muzzle, and Rethabile performing at LIve AMP on SABC1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uAA9hYCSGY Watch: DJ Big Sky, Luuda DJ and Sbhanga doing their thing at Mzansi Magic’s music show Massiv Metro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVbvBUquGLU
