RESIDENTS’ cries were finally answered on Tuesday after years of complaining. Residents of Bhucanana and Ntambanana, outside Empangeni in northern KZN, ended their year on a high note. They had asked the municipality several times for a community hall. In the end they didn’t just receive a hall but a recreational park and recycling centre as well. Nozibusiso Vezi (45) said all they had asked for was a community hall where they could hold events and meetings. But they were surprised when a recycling centre and recreational park were also built for them. “This is a great move that will decrease unemployment and crime in the area. “The recycling centre will create jobs while the park will be used to keep the youth busy.” Sizwe Nxele (29) said this was a great way to end the year. He said the youth would have something to keep themselves busy. UMhlathuze speaker Slondile Mkhize said now that there was a recycling centre, waste collected from households would be sent to the Empangeni landfill site. She said the hall could be used for weddings, funerals, meetings and other activities. “We want to encourage young men and women to seize the economic benefit brought by the centre to turn waste into money.”
