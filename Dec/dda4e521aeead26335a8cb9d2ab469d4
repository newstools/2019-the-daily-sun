COPS in Peddie, Eastern Cape, are investigating a double murder and rape after two bodies were found in shallow graves at the side of the road. It has not yet been established whether the two were murdered together, but cops aren’t ruling it out as the bodies were both found at the roadside. Police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni said the bodies were that of a man and a woman. “They were found not far from the roadside on different days in different villages. The woman was discovered in Lower Qeto by a villager on Tuesday while walking through the bush with his dogs,” he said. Tonjeni said the dogs showed interest in something at the side of the road, and when the owner investigated he found a human skull. “When he checked further, he saw a shallow grave covered with soil, stones and branches. It was established that it was a woman aged between 30 and 35 years,” he said. Tonjeni said although the body was in the early stages of decomposition, cops discovered she had been raped. “Three days earlier, police found a body of a man buried in a shallow grave near the roadside in Gcinisa Village,” he said. Anyone with missing relatives should contact Warrant Officer Mkululi Manisi on 082 301 9713, or Peddie detectives on 040 673 3311.
