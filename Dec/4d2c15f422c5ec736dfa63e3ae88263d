ORLANDO Pirates management is racing against time to ensure new coach Josef Zinnbauer sits on the bench on Saturday (3.30pm). Pirates take on Black Leopards in their last Absa Premiership match of the year at Orlando Stadium. Bucs official Floyd Mbele revealed that the German-born mentor is still waiting for his work permit from Home Affairs. Pirates fans are hoping the German-born mentor will be able to hit the ground running and restore the team’s pride following a string of poor results that saw caretaker coach Rhulani Mokwena being demoted back to his role as assistant coach. Mokwena registered only four wins in 15 matches since he replaced Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic in August. Said Mbele: “The coach has yet to receive his work permit. We hope he will be able to get it by Friday (today) and hopefully he will be on the bench.” If the 49 year-old former Hamburg coach doesn’t get his permit today, this means Mokwena might take over the unbearable hot seat for the last time. Although Zinnbauer’s coaching record doesn’t inspire confidence, Bucs’ fans are hoping he will be able to inspire his attack to score more goals, while tightening their defence that has been leaky under Mokwena. Zinnbauer might give defenders Justice Chabalala and Alfred Ndengane a chance to prove their worth as they were relegated to the stands by Mokwena. Pirates will play without their influential winger Thembinkosi Lorch, who is suspended after he got a red card during Bucs’ 3-2 win over Polokwane City on 26 November. On the other hand, Leopards will look to end the year on a positive note under Belgian mentor Luc Eymael, who replaced Lionel Soccoia after he was sacked in September. Lidoda Duvha will pin their hopes on the shoulders of striker Robert Ng’ambi to rub more salt into Pirates’ wound.
