IN 1999 the Mbhashe Local Municipality built a gravel road to service one of its villages. Twenty years later the gravel road in Vonqo Village, in Dutywa in the Eastern Cape, has apparently never been maintained.  Resident Manxenxe Magengelele said the road had been so badly eroded by heavy rain over the years that motorists found it difficult to drive on it. “We reported the road’s condition to our local councillor several times, but she never came to see it for herself,” said Manxenxe. “When it rains motorists can’t come to our village. Police vehicles and ambulances can’t respond to emergency situations. “If a person is injured we have to wait until the rain has subsided to take him or her to hospital.” Manxenxe said people who drew social grants were also affected as they were unable to travel to town. “If it rains for many days people suffer,” he said. Masakhane Sosikela, who was born in Vonqo but works in Mthatha about 90km away, has written to the municipality in a desperate bid to have the gravel road fixed. “I used to visit my family in Dutywa from time to time when the road was in good condition,” he said. “But now I don’t do it often because the road damages my car.” Mbhashe infrastructure portfolio head Mkhululi Mcotsho acknowledged receiving a letter from Masakhane. “We’re going to send a team to conduct an assessment of the road, after which we’ll have a council meeting to come up with a solution,” Mcontsho said.
