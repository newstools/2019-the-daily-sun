Mahlatsi Mashabela (16) received a new wheelchair on Friday! It was donated and delivered to her at her home in Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, by businessman Moshe Nkadimeng from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni. This was after Daily Sun published her story, headlined “Gogo pleads for a wheelchair”, on 29 November. Mahlatsi’s gogo Florah (62), who had asked the People’s Paper for help, said she was grateful as her granddaughter had been struggling for a long time to move around. “I thank Moshe for being so kind to travel from as far as Gauteng to bring this special gift. “She will now enjoy Christmas like everyone else. This is the best gift she ever got for Christmas.” Moshe, who owns a micro lending company, was happy to be a blessing to others and hoped the wheelchair would make Mahlatsi’s life better. “I was deeply touched by the gogo’s plea for a wheelchair,” he said. Mahlatsi said her life would be much easier. She said those who laughed at her would now eat humble pie.
