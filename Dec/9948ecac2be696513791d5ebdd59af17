At least one DA councillor and some of its coalition partners helped unseat the party in the Johannesburg metro by voting for the ANC's mayoral candidate, Geoff Makhubo. With the votes cast and counted during a sitting of the Johannesburg council on Wednesday to elect the new mayor, the ANC, who has 121 seats in the council, bagged 137 votes, giving it more than the 50% plus one needed to win the metro. The DA, with 103 seats, only managed to get 101 votes for its mayoral candidate, Funzela "Funzi" Ngobeni, while the EFF, with 30 seats, received 30 votes for its candidate, Musa Novela.To give more perspective on voting numbers, the IFP has five seats and AIC four, while the FF Plus, ACDP, UDM, Cope, Patriotic Alliance and Al Jama-ah have one seat each. As the ANC takes back the metro that it lost in the 2016 local government elections, voting figures left little doubt that coalition partners and at least one DA councillor became turncoats. DA Gauteng provincial chairperson Mike Moriarty told News24 he was disappointed they had turned on the party. He said it was an outright betrayal not only of the DA, but also the people who had voted them into power. Moriarty added he was certain at least one DA councillor voted for Makhubo and by extension the ANC, but there would be no witch hunt to find out who it was. "The question they need to ask is if they found it appropriate to vote for a tainted individual," Moriarty said, adding any DA councillor who voted for Makhubo should resign from the party. Commenting on the reality some of the DA's coalition partners in Johannesburg also voted with the ANC, Moriarty said their own voters would reject them for making that decision.  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/da-on-councillor-who-voted-for-ancs-geoff-makhubo-its-an-outright-betrayal-but-we-wont-go-on-a-witch-hunt-20191204
