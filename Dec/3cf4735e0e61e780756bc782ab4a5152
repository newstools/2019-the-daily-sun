A MONTH after being given an award by the health department for being the best in community nursing, Thembisa Yekani was still in disbelief. The 43-year-old, who’s based at Michael Mapongwana Clinic in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, couldn’t believe it when she was nominated at the Nursing Service Excellence Awards. “I love my job, and when I’m doing it I don’t expect to be praised. “The award came as a surprise. I never thought I’d get it.” She told the SunTeam she’d worked at various hospitals and clinics over the years, and this experience had taught her to treat patients with respect and dignity. She said when the winner was announced, she didn’t hear her name being called out. “I just saw my bosses calling out my name while I was sitting there looking at other people,” she said. “When they called out my name again, I went to the stage with a big smile.” She hoped the award would show people not all nurses were mean. Thembisile Mpu, an admin officer at the clinic, was proud of Thembisa. “Being one of the best nurses in the whole province is no child’s play. It shows she’s really good at what she does,” he said. Thembisile said the award would encourage other staff members to work hard.
