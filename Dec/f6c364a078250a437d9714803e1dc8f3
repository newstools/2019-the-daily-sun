This years Carols by Candlelight will feature Tarryn Lamb, Jo Black, Lira, Matthew Mole, Riana Nel, Rubber Duc, Early B, Roan Ash, Paxton, Joshua na die Reën, Swing City and the multi-award-winning Soweto Gospel Choir – kicking off the festive season in style! It’s an event for a great cause – collecting toys for little ones in need and raising funds for Jacaranda FM’s Good Morning Angels. The Johannesburg event will be taking place on the 7th of December at St. Stithians College, with the Pretoria edition heading to Loftus Versfeld on the 10th of December. Tarryn Lamb, Roan Ash, Swing City and the Soweto Gospel Choir will be performing at both events, with Matthew Mole, Lira, Rubber Duc and Paxton completing the line-up in Joburg and Jo Black, Riana Nel, Joshua na die Reën and Early B spreading the festive cheer in Pretoria. The Jacaranda FM presenters – including, amongst many others, Martin Bester, Liesl Laurie, Elma Smit, Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp, Rozanne McKenzie, Alex Jay and Rian van Heerden - will also be celebrating in full festive force, with the station broadcasting live from both events. The kiddies’ entertainment area, proudly provided by headline sponsors SPAR, will have the little ones thoroughly entertained with jumping castles, face-painters, games, crafts, buskers, movies and more! Entry is free, but in spreading the love to where it is needed most, attendees are encouraged to bring a toy which will be delivered to selected charity organisations. Candles will also be on sale at R30, songbooks at R10 and a songbook and candle bundle package at R35. All proceeds will go to Jacaranda FM Good Morning Angels. Gates at both events will open at 16h00 and the programme will officially kick-off at 19h00 – 21h00. For full event details, as well as all the dos and don’ts, please visit www.jacarandafm.com
