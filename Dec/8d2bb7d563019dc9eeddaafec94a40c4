KAIZER Chiefs have found their missing link. Amakhosi signed a gem in the form of Samir Nurkovic who has been a superb addition to Chiefs attack this season. The powerful Serbian-born striker, joined Amakhosi during the off-season in what was a surprise move from Slovakian Second Division side KFC Kormarno. He has proved to have been an inspired buy. Chiefs fans are hoping he will recall Amakhosi’s glory days matching the likes of legendary strikers Fani Madiba and Shane McGregor and lead Chiefs to the Absa Premiership title. Nurkovic completely ran the show as Chiefs ran riot when they defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 5-3 in their Premiership match at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday to remain top of the table. He scored his first PSL hat-trick to take his league tally to eight, level with Golden Arrows striker Knox Mutizwa and Highlands Park’s Peter Shalulile. Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp was impressed with Nurkovic and his strike partner Leonardo Castro, who scored the other two goals. He said he was lucky to have two physically imposing centre forwards. Said Middendorp: “But I think both he and Castro are prepared to help each other. When you have two players with that amount of power, we are definitely going to see more numbers in terms of goals.” Chiefs stretched their lead at the summit to 34 points, 10 points ahead of second placed SuperSport United. It was Chiefs eighth league win on the trot. Meanwhile, on Saturday, it was exactly a year since Middendorp took charge of Chiefs.
