PRESIDENT Donald Trump became the third president in the history of the US to be impeached. The House of Representatives made the decision in a historic vote on Wednesday, impeaching Trump on two impeachment articles – one charging him with abusing his office, the other charging him with obstructing congress. These are based on congress’ investigation into whether Trump attempted to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. Impeachment gives power to congress to remove presidents or other federal officials from office if enough lawmakers find that they have committed treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Three other presidents have faced impeachment proceedings, but only two have been successfully impeached. In 1868, Andrew Johnson was impeached, charged with breaching the Tenure of Office Act, but the Senate narrowly acquitted him by one vote. In 1974, Richard Nixon faced an impeachment inquiry, but he resigned before he could be impeached. In 1998, Bill Clinton was impeached, but he was acquitted by the Senate. During the House debates, Trump tweeted several times, calling the Democratic arguments “Atrocious lies by the radical left”. He had also made an extraordinary intervention on the eve of Wednesday’s vote, penning an angry six-page letter to Ms Pelosi accusing her of declaring “open war on American democracy”. – BUSINESS INSIDER
