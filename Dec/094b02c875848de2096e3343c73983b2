MZANSI's most dangerous roads have been named following five years of research. The N4 in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, and R61 in Mbizana, Eastern Cape have been named the deadlist roads according to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC). TimesLive reports that RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane told TimesLIVE they had compiled a list of a 100 of the worst roads across the country and the two recorded the highest number of deaths per year. The site reports that  24 people were killed in the two provinces over the past weekend to which Zwane added that drunken driving caused the accidents. “We have come to know that over month-end weekends, fatalities increase. People have more money to spend on alcohol,” he said. Zwabe said traffic officials will concentrate on speeding, overloading and  jaywalking for the duration of the festive season. He said the R573 in Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga, was the third worst road of death in the country. The other roads of death were the R61 in Cradock, N1 in Liangsburg, R71 in Mankweng, N2 in Libode, R37 in Mecklengburg, M35 in Folweni and N3 in Warden.
