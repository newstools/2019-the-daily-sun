WHEN he saw his favourite actor, Luthuli Dlamini, at his workplace, he wanted to take a selfie and greet him! But that turned sour when the actor took more than a selfie with him. Amos Masombuka from Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, said Dlamini stole his smart phone three weeks ago. The 47-year-old security guard said Dlamini was shooting at the Atterbury Theatre next to Amos’s workplace and sleeping at the hotel in the complex. He said when he saw him the first time, he was excited. “I asked to take photos with him because I usually see him on TV, he is one of my favorite actors,” he said. He said after a few days Dlamini came to him for help. “He asked me to lend him my phone claiming his fell in water. “So, I did because I was a huge fan and he was in need of help,” he said. He said Dlamini used his phone for days and he didn’t have a problem until he disappeared with it. “After almost a week, I was told he wasn’t at the hotel anymore. “He was gone, and he left with my phone and sim card,” he said. He said when Dlamini took his phone, he inserted his sim card and used it to make his calls. “He told me he will return the phone but never did and that made me super angry,” he said. Amos said his life is now stuck. “I don’t know anyone’s number by heart and head. “My whole life is in that phone and that man doesn’t want to bring it back. “I trusted and respected him but now I take him as a criminal,” he said. He said he doesn’t want money or a new phone. “All I want is my phone and sim card,” he said. When Daily Sun contacted Dlamini he said he knew who the man was. “He lent me his phone after l explained that mine was water damaged. I inadvertently left with the phone for a remote part of the Eastern Cape where I'm working, unfortunately there is hardly any reception here. “I return to Johannesburg on Monday but will have the phone couriered to him by tomorrow,” he said.
