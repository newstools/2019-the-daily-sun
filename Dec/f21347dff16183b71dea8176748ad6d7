MARITZBURG United coach Eric Tinkler believes Judas Moseamedi can be the answer to Bafana Bafana goal-scoring woes. Moseamedi has been on a fine form scoring crucial goals for his club. And that has left his coach Tinkler with no doubt that the powerful striker, can solve goal scoring  problems in the national team“Judas wants to succeed,” said Tinkler at the post-match press. “I said to him at the beginning of the season, that he has the potential to play for Bafana Bafana. "He’s one of those strikers that will chase lost courses.” Moseamedi was sublime when his side Maritzburg United lost 2-1 to Mamelodi Sundowns in the Telkom Knockout final on Saturday.The 25-year-old scored for Maritzburg on the day. Tinkler added: “Looking at the goal he scored, any other strikers wouldn’t have chased that ball. It was a lost course but he chased it and that is how he ended up scoring that goal,” “His work ethic, his work rate is absolutely superb. "Only people see him as this burly, strong, aggressive striker, but technically he’s also gifted. ”Moseamedi should have gone home with a brace just like he did when he single-handed Maritzburg to the final when they beat Kaizer Chiefs. He was unfortunately flagged offside in the dying minutes of the game. The Tzaneen-born player has been in the national team set up before and has scored ass well.He was part of Bafana squad during the Cosafa Cup in 2017 that was held in North West.
