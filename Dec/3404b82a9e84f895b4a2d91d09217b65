ATHLETICS SA (ASA) won’t be sending a team to make the numbers at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. The local athletics federation has put stringent qualifying criteria for athletes who would like to represent the country at the Olympics. President Aleck Skhosana said ASA doesn’t want to subject the nation to mediocrity at the biggest global sporting event. Athletes have mixed feelings when it comes to the strict qualifying criteria set out by ASA. In the marathons, only the fastest three men and three women, will book their places on the plane to Tokyo. Only Gerda Steyn has run an Olympic qualifying time so far in the women’s team. But Nolene Conrad has also been included in the team. Steyn, who won the Comrades Marathon title in June, clocked 2:27:48 to secure 11th place at the New York City Marathon in the US last month. The A qualifying standard for women is 2:28:48. Nedbank Running Club team manager Nick Bester, who works with marathon athletes, said: “It’s hard for female athletes to run the required time. How many female athletes can run that time in SA?” Steyn also feels it’s a bit strict. Said Steyn: “The qualifying time is debatable. It’s tough but we should run it as set out by the federation. I must admit, not everyone can run it though. Only a few can.” ASA has named seven athletes in the men’s marathon team in their provisional squad. But there are only two spots available as Stephen Mokoka has received a wild card after he secured a top 10 entry when he finished in the top 10 at the IAAF world champs in Doha, Qatar in September. Desmond Mokgobu and Elroy Gelant are the two other male athletes who have qualified. But their places are safe as the other four athletes on the list can still run the qualifying time of 2:12:03. Sibusiso Nzima and Collen Mulaudzi are out to get them.Nzima said: “I’m fit, healthy and ready to run a sub 2:10 or 12.” Skhosana said it’s a case of going big or going home. Skhosana added: “Work hard for it or stay home.”
