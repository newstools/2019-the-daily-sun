Legendary radio presenter and actor Cocky Two Bull’s memory will be celebrated at his Soweto home this Saturday. The Tlhotlhalemaje family in Jabavu, Soweto decided to rekindle the memory of the iconic 702 presenter after they went to the station to request tapes, but they were surprised that the librarian didn’t know what they were talking about. “This made us to realise that we need to revive the memory of our father because of the role he played in the history of broadcasting and the arts,” said son Cassius Tlhotlhalemaje. He said they have invited community members and industry friends to commemorate his life in things he enjoyed doing. “People will bring their own drinks and there will be some music and poetry, and a general sharing of humility, which was his best attribute.”
