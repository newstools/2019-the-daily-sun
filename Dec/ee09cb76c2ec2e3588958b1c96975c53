KAIZER Chiefs star midfielder Joseph "Tight" Molangoane and the charismatic Pastor Mboro have a seriously striking resemblance - they could easily be mistaken for siblings. Molangoane is a hardworking midfield workhorse whose career was almost destroyed by a career-threatening injury, but he recovered and worked to regain his place in the Amakhosi team. Mboro, real name Paseka Motsoeneng, is a South African televangelist of Incredible Happenings Ministries. He has a love for fancy cars and expensive clothes. He also has thousands of followers at his church in Ekurhuleni. Maybe Molangoane and Mboro are long lost brothers who were separated at birth - what's your take?
