THEY’RE living in fear of being buried alive by sinking ground. This after a car fell into a huge sinkhole in Jeffsville, Atteridgeville, Tshwane, on Sunday morning. The residents told the SunTeam they had been facing sinkhole problems for years. Their councillor had allegedly promised to move them to another kasi but nothing happened. PABALLO'S LOVER: MY WIFE DID NOT KILL HER! They said almost 50 shacks had since been swallowed by sinkholes. Pinki Buthelezi (37) said she saw cracks developing in the ground before the car fell into a giant hole. “I called the neighbours to inform them about the cracks. I knew something was going to happen as this area has a lot of sinkholes,” she said. She said residents watched helplessly as their neighbour’s car was being swallowed. “It felt like a movie,” she said.  Pinki said the last incident took place six months ago. Two families were moved after they discovered sinkholes in their shacks. The owner of the car, Solomon Maesela (47), said he was not home when his car fell into the sinkhole. “I was at work when my wife called me saying the car was sinking,” he said. He said he feared his car would disappear if it rained. Solomon told Daily Sun he was happy no one was hurt. Councillor Solomon Sedibeng said he was aware of the problem. “I’m with other ward councillors and we’re trying to decide what to do. “We’re struggling to get through to the municipality because the offices are closed for the festive season,” he said. He confirmed the sinkhole problem had been affecting the area for years. “This is not a safe area for people to live in. We’ve been agitating to move them to another area. But we need the municipality to help us,” he said.
