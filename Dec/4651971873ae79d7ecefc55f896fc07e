THEMBILE Blose desperately needs help to bury his sister with dignity. The 36-year-old from V section in Umlazi, south of Durban, can’t afford to bury his sister Nonhlanhla Vumba (23) as no one in the family is working. Nonhlanhla died after being hit by a stray bullet at her home last Monday. Thembile told Daily Sun Nonhlanhla was sitting on her bed in her shack when people started shooting at a man outside her home. He said: “I was sitting in my shack when I heard the shooting. “I thought it was children playing with fireworks. “When I went into her shack, I was shocked to find Nonhlanhla lying on the floor bleeding. I asked a neighbour to help me take her to Prince Mshiyeni Hospital.” Thembile said when they arrived at the hospital, his sister was declared dead. “I heard a group of men were chasing a man they had been looking for. While they were shooting at him, a stray bullet hit my sister,” he said. Thembile said the man who was being shot at died in the road, but no one knew who he was.  “I heard they had been fighting at Glebelands Hostel and they chased the man until they ended up at our section.” Thembile said his parents were dead and no one in his family was employed. Councillor Robert Mzobe said the family should come to his office so he could see how he’d assist them. KZN Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “A case of murder was opened at Umlazi Police Station for investigation. “On the same day, a man (23) was fatally shot by unknown suspects.”
