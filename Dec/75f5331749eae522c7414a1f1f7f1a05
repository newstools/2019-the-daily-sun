CONTRALESA president kgoshi Mathibela Mokena said they
welcome the release of the Abathembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindwebo. Mokoena was addressing local journalists at his home on
Christmas Day at in home in Bushbuckridge. "This will bring stability in that kingdom. This is
what we bargained for all along. We consulted with the royal house and started
the process of requesting the president to pardon our king. It is a known fact
that the incarceration of our king was politically motivated. His trouble
started when he called the first president inkwenkwe or a boy who did not go
through initiation rituals. He was also victimized when he publicly joined the
DA that did not seat well with some senior leaders in our country," said
kgoshi Mokoena. Mokoena said this country favors Roman Dutch law instead of
their own customary law.Â  He said
traditional leaders were given some powers previously but in the current
constitution all that has been taken away. "We have our own way of punishing a king, a queen or a
traditional leader if he or she is found to be on the other side of the law not
what our king was put through. South Africa made history by being the first
democratic government that incarcerated a seating king,that was an
African." Mokoena said there will be stability in the Abathembu nation
and its royal house. "The king has to resume his responsibilities. This
will only happen if the criminal record is expunged. I hope to get a favourable
response from the state president Ramaphosa," said kgoshi Mokoena.
