We have all seen the memes and jokes on social media. "Wives, see you in January!" "I will lose my phone this festive season and find it next year!" These may be poking harmless fun at the knock some relationships take during the festive season, however, the reality is that some people really do get swallowed up by the festive season madness and neglect their relationships. While the festive season spells family gatherings for some, there is an odd group of people who see the festive season as the time for side chicks and boys, friends, all-nighter parties and boozing sprees. This brings back memories for 35-year-old businesswoman Nobantu Msindo, a Unified resident in the West Rand, who says that it became a norm for her ex to disappear in December. "He would go on leave from work around the 15th of December, and I would immediately know what was coming. He would disappear from the 16th of December and spend all his money with friends and girls. I would call him and he would say he is eating 'joy'. Sometimes a girl would answer. Most of the times the phone was off. "Coming back home, around the 2nd of January, he would be broke, with no phone and he would even ask me for transport money to go to work. I always forgave him. I even gave him money." Msindo says she put up with this for three years until she put her foot down last year. She looks forward to enjoying the festive season without worrying where her man is. Can you rekindle your love life after having abandoned your significant other the whole of December? Only if you genuinely saw the error of your ways, says psychologist Mampho Mofokeng. "Remember, a repeated mistake is no longer a mistake. Yes, you can forgive an indiscretion once, but once a partner shows you that they are not committed to change, it becomes clear where that ship is going." Mofokeng advises couples to make a commitment to include each other in their festive plans, keep in touch and not be reckless in spending or drinking.
