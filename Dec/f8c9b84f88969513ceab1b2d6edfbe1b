RESIDENTS of Browns Farm in Philippi, Cape Town want the city to fix their fight with municipal cleaners who have stopped giving them service. Residents think cleaners stopped working because people outside the area had been hired. Mlungisi Mdlankomo (38) said it had been over three weeks since rubbish was collected. “This is not healthy. There was no reason for this to drag on for more than a week,” he said. Another resident, Nosipho Myantaza (40), said she risked getting sick. “We won’t enjoy the festive season if this continues,” she said. “What’s so difficult about getting rid of the person who doesn’t live in this area and hiring the right one?” She said their kids played in the rubbish. “We can’t stop going to work to look after our kids,” she said. “The city must just fix this so people can start cleaning the area.” Water and waste mayoral committee member Xanthea Limberg said cleaning services were disrupted by residents due to a dispute over the employment of someone they believed was not from the area. “Several meetings took place and community leaders eventually accepted the employment of this worker and allowed services to resume,” said Limberg.
