A store where female employees are encouraged to wear badges signalling when they're having periods has provoked a mixed reaction. Michi Kake in Osaka, Japan, wants to break the stigma surrounding menstruation by letting colleagues and customers know when it's 'that time of the month'. According to Japanese publication WWD Japan, the badge represents a manga character named Seiri-chan - or Little Miss Period - which is a symbol of period in the country. It's provoked criticism on social media, with one commenter writing of the non-compulsory initiative: 'Itâ€™s all kinds of wrong. 'You can just imagine people saying she is in a bad mood because of PMS. Makes me sick to my stomach. Stupid move in 2019.' Another wrote: 'Any employer that asked me to wear a badge when I'm on my period would be getting sued.'
