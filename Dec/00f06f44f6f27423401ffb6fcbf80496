WE ALL know how difficult it is to stay fit during holidays. But we need to stay fit because it improves our mood and overall health. The wikiHow website shared some tips to help you stay fit this December:Exercise.Walk, jog or cycle. No matter your speed, these are key lifestyle activities that keep your heart and lungs active. To keep your knees strong, cycling is a better solution.Exercise at home. Some at-home exercises include, push-ups, sit-ups and yoga.Exercise in the gym. If you like the gym atmosphere, then this is a great place to stay fit. Use the machines for cardio and weights. But be careful and never use weights that are too heavy. Use smaller weights instead.Join a local sport team.If you are not a fan of the gym, join a local sports team. Many cities have their own recreational sports teams.Maintain a balanced diet. If you exercise and eat a lot of junk food, you won’t get fit. This is because junk food turns to fat almost immediately. Junk foods contain poor nutrition and are high in sodium and sugar. Because of this, your body sugar levels drop after consumption and you end up feeling fatigued with a major lack of energy.
 FOODS TO AVOID Yoga practices such as downward facing dog or sun salutations are easily done on the carpeted ground or on a yoga mat. The most popular city sports are: kickball, softball, basketball, pickle-ball, and ultimate frisbee. Foods high in sugar. These include donuts, cakes, cookies, pudding, cereal, sodas, canned and dried fruits.Stick to your plan.You know you can do it. You’re the only one who can control your action and willpower can make you happy. If you have a routine that you follow, it’s easier to stick to it than assuming you’ll get to exercising or get to eating a healthy meal.Treat yourself. Set goals for yourself and when you have reached them reward yourself. This can include going to a movie, massage or relaxing bath.
