GOSPEL singer Omega Khunou shared an emotional message to his late buddy Neyi Zimu. The singer was battling a rare skin condition called mycosis fungoides and passed away at Busamed Modderfontein Private Hospital in Joburg earlier this month. Omega and Neyi formed a gospel music group called Friends In Praise. The singer shared that he misses him already. The pair have performed together around the country and abroad. The tweet read: “This was the last performance of Friends in Praise together, singing Yehlankosi even on this day we were wearing the same colours. I miss you already Mogotsi waka, you will forever be in my heart.”
