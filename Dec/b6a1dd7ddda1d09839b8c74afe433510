Two things that are having a detrimental effect on human behaviour today came into force when black people ascended to power in 1994. The first was the removal of the Bible and Christianity as the moral guide of the nation. Both were replaced by the Constitution and a culture of freedom. The second was the introduction of Nelson Mandela as the saviour. It was hoped both would make South Africa the best place in the world, where racism, religious intolerance and oppression would be non-existent. But this was not to be. Just look at the number of people who go to churches and those who go to taverns. It’s the opposite of what the situation was in the early 1990s when more people went to church. People seem to think fake pastors and fake churches are a Christian problem. They couldn’t be more wrong. They are a societal problem. Government doesn’t offer an alternative to religious education. The Constitution is not and can never be the answer to spiritual and cultural questions. It’s just a legal document. Daily Sun does good by reporting on fake pastors. But it’s not its business to classify pastors as fake or genuine. The newspaper is not a church or spiritual centre where spirituality and religion are its specialised area of focus. Our leaders have sold the soul of the nation to Satan through fraud and corruption.
