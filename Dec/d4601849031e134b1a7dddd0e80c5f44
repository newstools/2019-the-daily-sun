Most of us have faked a cough and sniffle to get out of going to school or work for a day. However, it usually does not involve lying to a doctor and faking symptoms to legitimize your sick leave. Well for some of us it does. According to a previous Health24 article, an employer can request a medical certificate if an employee has been absent from work for more than two consecutive days – in other words, from the third day onwards.    Health24 spoke to Dr Imraan Shaikh, a qualified general practitioner who has experience working at family practices, tertiary hospitals, trauma centres and a children’s hospital. According to Dr Shaikh, the conditions faked the most are headaches, gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea and back pain. On a reddit thread entitled Doctors/nurses of Reddit; What is the most obvious case of a patient 'faking it' you have ever seen? there are thousands of comments from doctors, paramedics and nurses sharing encounters they have had with people who have faked an illness or two. While the thread contains various ailments faked by people, one that seems to be popular among fakers are seizures, which ironically are the easiest to spot when being faked. What doctors look for Dr Shaikh explained that "the signs that we have used are not many as each individual is unique in their presentation of the said ‘fake’ ailment."
