Avoid binge drinking during the festive season. Holidays are meant to be a time for having fun and celebrating, and alcohol features largely in the festivities. The silly season is here and it’s important for us to be more vigilant and careful as alcohol consumption hits its peak during the festive season. But a combination of good cheer and abundant alcohol can take the fun too far. Binge drinking can lead to health problems. It’s associated with particular health risks including damage to the liver, heart, brain and stomach. Drinking too much alcohol can have long-term effects on your health. If you really have to drink over the festive season, think about setting limits for yourself and keeping an eye on how many drinks you’re having. Meanwhile, others are going to pull disappearing acts because of drinking too much. Point is, consumers need to know what the legal alcohol limit in South Africa is when driving. It’s just not negotiable: you have to drink responsibly at all times. - Letter from Slight Ramphaka, in Florida
