He was not seen again. “Police are offering a reward of R100 000 for any valuable information that could lead to his rearrest.” Anyone with information has been urged to contact Captain Tshinyadzo Ndou at 082 807 2666. “They can also call the CrimeStop number 086000 10111, alternatively send an SMS to the Crime Line 32211, or report to their nearest police station.
