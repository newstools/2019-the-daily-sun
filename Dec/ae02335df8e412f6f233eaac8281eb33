LEGENDARY radio presenter Oshebeng Alpheus Koonyaditse says he has been humbled by the public reaction to news of his retirement from media industry. Koonyaditse sent shockwaves through social media when he announced his departure from Motsweding FM on Friday to end a service spanning three decades. No sooner had he made the announcement than fans began paying tribute to the outgoing radio guru who has been the heart of the station’s sport and current affairs. “The journey began on December 1. At the time a skinny starry-eyed young boy with nothing but unadulterated enthusiasm was given an opportunity to serve,” Koonyaditse wrote on Facebook. “Three decades later it’s time for change. December 1 ushers another date with destiny. Thank you for having been part of the journey.” Koonyaditse has joined the North West Department of Community Safety and Transport. “I felt the time was right to leave,” he concluded.
