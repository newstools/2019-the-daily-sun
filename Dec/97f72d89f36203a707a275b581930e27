CRISTIANO Ronaldo was at his brilliant best once again for Juventus last night. The Portuguese star scored an impressive flying header to help the Old Lady to a 2-1 away win over Sampdoria at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. As always, Ronaldo’s brilliance once again sparked the debate about who is the best player in the world between him and Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. Videos of Ronaldo’s impressive header were doing the rounds on social media with fans hailing the former Real Madrid star as arguably the best header of the ball in world football. His coach, Mauricio Sarri, was also left astonished by Ronaldo’s wonder goal, so much so that he couldn’t help but use strong language to describe it afterwards. "What did I think when I saw Ronaldo's goal? I thought, ‘F***, what a goal!’ I say, ‘F***’ because if I said, ‘Damn’ it wouldn't be fair towards the goal," said the former Chelsea mentor. “I think the amount of time he spent in the air before the header was incredibly long. A wonderful, physical and technical action." The opposition coach, Claudio Ranieri, also could not help but sing Ronaldo’s praises. Said Ranieri: "Ronaldo did something that you see in the NBA (National Basketball Association), he was up in the air for an hour and a half!"There's nothing you can say about it, you can only congratulate him and move on."
