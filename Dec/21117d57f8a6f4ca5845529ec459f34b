“WHAT you see is what you get, and what you get is what you see with Mauricio” These are the words of Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane as he waxes lyrical about his South American striker Mauricio Affonso. Though Affonso hasn’t quite lit up set the scene since he arrived in July, Mosimane reckons he has found his man for big Caf Champions League matches. “He is a Champions League player… that kind of a player,” said Mosimane. “I know we need a little bit of fluidity, the back heels here and there in our game. But when you go to Casa (Wydad Casablanca), there is no space for people like Gaston Sirino and Themba Zwane. Affonso will do battle for us there. We hope he meets one corner… one free-kick and get us the goals. We brought him for that role.” Mosimane and his troops flew out to Morocco yesterday for their Saturday’s showdowns with Wydad at Mohammed V Stadium. And it seems he will be relying heavily on the Uruguayan for goals. “What you see is what you get with Mauricio. He is never going to be a Sirino… a Themba Zwane. It’s the same reason we brought JB (Jeremy Brockie) here for. We brought him to score goals. His goal ratio is not bad, given the number of games he’s played and goals scored.” Mosimane has recruited Emiliano Tade, another South American, for a similar role last season, but the striker spend more time in the sickbay than on the pitch. The Brazilians got their Group C stage campaign off to a perfect start, thumping Pedro De Luanda 3-0 at home. But it is not that smooth-sailing in Casablanca. “It’s tough in Casa,” admitted Mosimane. “We haven’t won there. We must play it smart. We must make sure Wydad don’t get the full points.”
