28-year-old Kgaugelo Tshwae went on vacation and never came
back. Her burnt body was found inside her Mini Cooper in the
bushes on 24 November 2019 in Mapetla Section, Mmakau. Tshwae reportedly failed to come back home on the 24th
of November 2019 after vacation at Hartbeespoort dam with friends.  Kgaugelo’s mother went to the police station in Ga-rankuwa on
Monday, to report a missing person, then she got a call that her daughter’s
body was found in Mmakau. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said later
on, Kgaugelo’s body was positively identified by family members. Her 37-year-old boyfriend was later arrested.  He is facing charges of kidnapping, robbery, murder,
defeating the ends of justice and possession of suspected stolen property. “Following intensive investigations into the matter, the
suspect was linked with the alleged murder after Tshwae’s bank card was found
in his possession. “As result, he was arrested for kidnapping, robbery, murder,
defeating the ends of justice and possession of suspected stolen property,” Mokgwabone
said. He is expected to re-appear in court on Wednesday, 11
December 2019 for a formal bail application. The Provincial Commissioner of North West, Lieutenant
General Baile Motswenyane, strongly condemned the senseless murder of the
woman. She emphasised that Gender Based Violence is one of the national
priorities and that the police will not hesitate to turn the tide against
anyone who commits crimes such as this one.
