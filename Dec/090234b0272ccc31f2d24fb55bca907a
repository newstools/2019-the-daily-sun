Police have
arrested a man for allegedly killing a person at the Menlyn Maine shopping
centre in Pretoria on Monday. The
shooting took place in the parking lot. Police
spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said they had arrested a 45-year-old
man in relation to the fatal shooting of another man around midday on Monday. "It is
alleged that the deceased was with two other men at Menlyn Maine, when one of
them approached the suspect. An altercation ensued between the men. Preliminary
reports further indicate that the suspect retreated to his vehicle and returned
with a firearm, and fired more than one shot at the deceased who was attempting
to diffuse the situation. The man was declared dead on the scene. "Police
have seized the firearm used by the suspect for further investigation, while
the motive is yet to be determined. The arrested suspect will appear in the
Pretoria Magistrate's Court in due course on a charge of murder," said
Peters.  THE BELOW CONTAINS GRAPHICS IMAGES, IT'S NOT FOR SENSITIVE VIEWERS.  SOURCE: NEWS24
