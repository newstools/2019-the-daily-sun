KAIZER Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp and SuperSport United midfielder Sipho Mbule have won the Absa Premiership monthly awards for the month of November. Middendorp bagged the Coach of the Month accolade, his third in a row, after guiding his charges to four wins from as many league outings since the start of November. This has seen the Amakhosi, the runaway leaders at the top of the Absa Premiership table, maintain their ten point gap over second placed SuperSport. Meanwhile, Unitedâ€™s Mbule shared the stage with Middendorp after his impressive displays in the month of November saw him named the best player in the league during that period. Matsatsantsa A Pitori picked up six points out of a possible 12 in their four matches in November to climb to second on the standings. Mbule was a key figure in the United team, scoring two goals as the Tshwane outfit defeated Bidvest Wits and Maritzburg United.
