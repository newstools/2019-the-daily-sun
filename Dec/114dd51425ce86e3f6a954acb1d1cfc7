The National Assembly adopted the rules for the removal of the head of a Chapter 9 institution, such as the Public Protector, on Tuesday. This after the National Assembly rules committee finalised the rules last week. Parliament decided to draft the rules as it was considering instituting proceedings to remove Public Protector Busisiwe Mkwhebane. On two occasions during the Fifth Parliament, then-DA chief whip John Steenhuisen unsuccessfully attempted to have the portfolio committee institute removal proceedings against Mkhwebane. As the Sixth Parliament got going, the DA again asked for such a process, which National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise referred to the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services. Amid a slew of court findings against Mkhwebane, the calls for the process to be expedited increased from the DA and civil society organisations. Mkhwebane wrote to Modise to complain there were no rules for the process to remove her and threatened court action.After considering the case, the committee referred it to the rules committee to draft rules for the removal of the head of a Chapter 9 institution. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/national-assembly-adopts-rules-to-remove-chapter-9-heads-20191203
