 AT THE end of November two cash vans were robbed on the same day in Tshwane. A few days into December another cash-in-transit van has been robbed. All these robberies happened in broad daylight. The latest one happened in Danville, west of Tshwane. The video went viral on social media. In the video, the first suspect can be seen running towards a guard with what appears to be a firearm in his hand. The guard then puts his hands behind his head as the suspect appears to threaten him. During this time, a second robber is seen pulling a large bag out of the back of the van.  The driver of the van suddenly realizes what is taking place and drives off. One of the suspects is seen running after the van before he moves out of sight on the CCTV camera. Police spokeswoman, Colonel Brenda Muridili, said police are still looking for the suspects. She said a security guard had just collected cash from Spar when four armed men pointed at him with pistols and opened the cash van. “The suspects managed to get away with an undisclosed amount of money and fled the scene. “No shots were fired,” she said. She said authorities immediately attended to the scene to comb for evidence.
