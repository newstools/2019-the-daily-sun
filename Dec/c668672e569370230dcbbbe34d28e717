News broke on the morning of Christmas Eve that multi-award winning singer and pastor, Khaya Mthethwa and former Miss SA Ntando Kunene-Mthethwa are getting a divorce. The shocking announcement was made by Ntando on her Instagram page where the statement she released caused shock waves across social media platforms and to his fans around the country.  Khaya hasn't said anything about the split following the announcement, but there has since been a video of him preaching that has been circulating. Although it's not clear when the video was taken, it's clear that he was preaching at Assemblies of God church, in Sandton. In the video, he opens about having huge struggles in his marriage and even mentioned that at the beginning of the year, in January, he was ready to end his marriage, despite what people see on social media, and pictures of them looking happy on red carpets. The singer said he had already made up his mind that he wanted to end his marriage next month. He said his marriage was amazing and shared that he had huge trouble in his marriage in the past two years. Earlier this month, the singer posted a picture of them on their wedding day as they were celebrating two years of marriage. In the sermon, Khaya shared his message: “It’s easier to leave, but harder to cleave.” He added that even though they were going their separate ways, he said his marriage was an amazing experience, including the birth of his son.
