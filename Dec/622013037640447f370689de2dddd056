South Africans are now doing it for themselves. Designer Lekau Sehoana took his pain and turned it into multi million business.   Lekau says the dream started when he was 14 back in 2003. “I created my own Shoe using a Torn Sneaker Sole. Because I didn't have any Shoes to wear,”  I used old Denim Jeans and Polyurethane They became a hit and people started ordering them." He says 16 Years later, lacking shoes made him to create his own  brand called Drip Footwear.  “ I call them "the Township Dream". I started with 600 Pairs that sold out within 6 weeks. Now we are on 1200 and even growing Faster. A Pair goes for R900 and we Courier across SA and Deliver in Gauteng at no extra cost at all.”
