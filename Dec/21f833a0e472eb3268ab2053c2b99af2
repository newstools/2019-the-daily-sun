RHULANI Mokwena has been demoted to a assistant coach positioning after Orlando Pirates appointed new mentor Josef Zinnbauer. On Saturday Mokwena’s charges squandered a two-goal lead in the last seven minutes of the match against Baroka FC and were forced to settle for 2-2 draw. The result did not sit well with Buccaneers die-hard fans as they were calling for the coaches head after the match at Peter Mokaba Stadium. The club has since then moved swiftly to get a new coach. Mokwena will continue as Interim Coach until Zinnbauer’s work permit is granted. Mokwena will return to his position as Assistant Coach alongside Fadlu Davids. On Mokwena, Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza said: “It is important that we thank Rulani for the fearless manner in which he stepped up to the plate when the need arose. “One of the important lessons leaders learn at the top is about themselves. They are called‚ ‘Knowing what I know now’ lessons. I have no doubt that Rulani has learned a lot of those for his betterment and that of the team.” Bucs currently occupy the sixth spot on the Absa Premiership table with 17 points from 13 outings.
