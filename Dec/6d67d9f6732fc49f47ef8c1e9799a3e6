Oswell from Mabopane, Tshwane, said his daughter was walking with her sister Ashil (12) and brother Nyasa (6) when a car hit two of them. The two-year-old Future Garadwa died on the spot, while the 12-year-old was taken to hospital. Oswell said he was called from church by neighbours saying something had happened and I must rush home,” he said. He said when he got there, he found his daughter lying on the ground. “That small body was wrapped in silver foil. I was shocked and angry,” he said. He said the person who hit them didn’t show any remorse. “A man was teaching his girlfriend to drive and she lost control of the car and hit the children on the pavement,” he said. Oswell said when he went to open a case, the police refused. “The police said it wasn’t her fault, it might have been because the car was new,” he said. He said he wanted justice to prevail.

Only then can we advise regarding a case,” she said.
