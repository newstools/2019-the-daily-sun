FORMER Orlando Pirates coach Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic says he can implement a system that will help Zimbabwe national team qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Sredojevic is among the candidates shortlisted for the vacant coaching job to replace Sunday Chidzambga who resigned in July after Zimbabwe failed to get past the first round of Africa Cup of Nations finals in Egypt. The Warriors interim coach Joey Antipas’ contract is due to expire at the end of this month. Sredojevic is currently unemployed after being sacked by Egyptian giants Zamalek on 2 December following a string of poor results and was replaced by former Al Ahly mentor Patrice Carteron. “I am interested in the project, not just the job,” said Sredojevic who is currently in Qatar to watch the Club World Cup. He went on: “If I go there, I will come with the system and strategy that will ensure abundance in talent and quality Zimbabwe can turn into performance and results to take them to Africa Cup of Nations 2021 and World Cup 2022.”
