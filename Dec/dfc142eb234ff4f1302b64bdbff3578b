Senegal born singer Akon is planning to be the next Barack Obama as he intends to run for US presidency. The ‘Locked Up’ rapper, who has previously shown his interest in politics, made the surprise admissions during the latest edition of NME’s Show & Tell video series. “Now, that’s something I’m definitely going to attempt to do before I retire,” he said of a potential presidential run.“I got this close [squeezes fingers together] to running for president in 2020, but then I thought about it and said ‘Well, if I run now I would never be able to do music again. Before I say goodbye to music, I’ve just got to come back into the game and have as much fun as I possibly can and get it out.He added: “Once you get into office there’s no coming back.’ But I guarantee you, once I’m done with this, the future in politics is definitely possible.”
