WHEN they made their way out of a Pep store in KwaMashu
Shopping Centre, north of Durban with undisclosed amount of cash, they thought
they had accomplished their mission. Little did they know that across the shopping centre that
they ran towards as they tried to escape, was a satellite cop shop in it with
policemen on alert. The incident happened in the early hours of Friday. The group of armed thugs entered the store pretending to be
customers. "While there was no one paying attention, some accosted
a male security guard. They shot at him in the stomach and neck. Others went to
the cashiers and demanded cash in the tills as well as the key to the safe,
where they took all the money,” said the police. The police said they further asked another cashier to give
them the key to where all the cell phones are kept. "They loaded them into a big shopping bag they found
inside the store, before they left,” said the cops. The police said it was when they reached the other side of
the railway where police noticed that there was something going on and they
began chasing after them. "The shooting ensued but luckily no one was killed or
injured. One thug was nabbed, and cell phones and cash were recovered while the
rest of the thugs ran off," said the police source. When Daily Sun arrived at the shopping centre around the
store was still closed. It was opened nearly two hours later. The store manager only known as Nonsi said: "We are not
allowed to give out any information to the media about the incident. We are
also not allowed to give out contacts of our superiors at the head office.
Whatever information that you need, please ask for it in the police." KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that
she was aware of the incident.
