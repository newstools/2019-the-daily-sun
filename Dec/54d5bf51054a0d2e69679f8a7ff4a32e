INITIATION schools in Gauteng recently resumed their operations after they were suspended in 2018 to curb deaths. But no sooner had they gone back to business than they claimed their first victim. Mpho Mothupi (16) from Sebokeng zone 10 in the Vaal allegedly died at an initiation school in Anglers, outside Lenasia South in Joburg. But according to his distraught family, Mpho was murdered and didn’t die from a stomach ache as the school had claimed. The family told Daily Sun Mpho went missing on 23 November. His mum Matumelo (48) said the family reported him missing to the police. “A young man came to the house to tell us Mpho was at an initiation school. “After two days, an initiation chief came to the house to tell us Mpho was at his camp,” she said. “I told him I wanted my child back. He told me he had undergone an initiation process.” She said when she asked him about her son’s whereabouts, he changed the names of places. “He lied and told us he was in the Free State. I asked my relatives that side to check initiation schools in their kasi, but he was nowhere to be found,” she said. Matumelo said last Monday she felt something bad might have happened. “I called the chief and asked if my son was alright. He said he was okay except that he was suffering from a stomach ache,” she said. “Two days later I called the chief again. He told me Mpho was getting worse. Later that day a woman told us he was no more.” She said police told her husband Mpho had been killed. Gauteng cops spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police had opened an inquest docket after of a teenager’s body was found on 18 December in Lenasia. No other person had been present at the time the body was found.
