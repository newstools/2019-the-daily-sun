After struggling to arrest a hostile suspect, they eventually arrested him. Resisting arrest and assaulting an officer of the law is a serious offense and anyone who violates that will face justice. The Kagiso SAPS spokesman, Solomon Sibiya told Daily Sun that some members of the community of Tshepisong at least showed some decency and protected our member from a violent suspect that had already inflicted a wound to his finger. This comes after a complaint of domestic violence that took place on Monday night at Tshepisong's phase 5. “The suspect instead resisted an arrest and a struggle ensued. During the struggle the suspect further injured the cop’s ring finger. "Residents who were nearby noticed that and assisted the police officer to effect an arrest,” he said. Sibiya said the suspect was eventually put inside the police vehicle and later detained at Kagiso SAPS. The member was taken to hospital for treatment. A case of assaulting a police officer was opened, and the suspect was formally charged.
