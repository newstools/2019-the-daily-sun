PASTOR Neyi Zimu touched a lot of lives through his preaching and music. This was seen by the number of people who attended his memorial service at the Word Of Faith Christian Centre in Sebokeng in the Vaal yesterday. Pastor June Tsotesti said they planned a prayer day for yesterday to pray for Zimu to get better, but little did they know the day would be his memorial service. He told those who gathered at the church to continue praying for the Zimu family, particularly his wife Nelisiwe Sibisi-Zimu and his children. Though it was cold yesterday, the mood inside the church was electric as friends, family and fellow worshippers filled the centre to capacity. Due to the high number of people who braved the cold, an overflow area was set up in a tent outside, with flat screens to give those outside a feeling of what was happening inside. Everyone in the church sang along when the choir sang Zimu’s songs. The all-time favourite Jehova Retshepile Wena seemed to be the song of the day. Fani Ntlama described the gospel star as more than a friend. “He was a brother to me. “My heart is bleeding because of his passing, but I’m happy he is now resting,” he said. Zimu’s wife Nelisiwe was sitting among family members with her son Muzi. The pastor died after he lost his battle with a rare skin disease.described as a disorder of the blood and lymphatic system that becomes visible on the skin.
