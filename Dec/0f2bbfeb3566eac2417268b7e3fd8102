STRESS can affect your health. On World Stress Awareness Day (6 November), the spotlight fell on global stress levels. And the American Institute of Stress reported that near-epidemic levels have been reached. The world of work was pointed as one of the main contributors. Research shows that employee stress levels have increased by close to 20% in three decades. This has serious implications for people’s health, in the short- and long-term. Sanlam’s chief medical officer, Dr Marion Morkel, said employers need to get more serious about workers’ well-being and mental health to avoid stress reaching dangerously high levels. “The World Health Organisation suggests work-related stress is often the result of people feeling that tasks don’t match their knowledge and abilities. It’s made worse when individuals don’t feel supported or find they have little control over work processes.” In Mzansi, one in six people suffers from anxiety, depression or substance abuse problems. According to Dr Morkel, stress can also play a role in systemic chronic disorders, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and auto-immune disorders. The following are the signs to look out for: What can employers do to prevent stress at work? Create an open, inclusive culture where staff feels safe to share their mental health journeys. This can be done through workshops, encouraging people to take paid leave, allowing mental health days and providing counselling and coaching services. Burn-out is also closely linked to stress. It leads to “feelings of energy depletion, increased mental distance from one’s job or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job and reduced professional efficacy”.
