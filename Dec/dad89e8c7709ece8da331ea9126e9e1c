MARITZBURG United came from behind to deny Kaizer Chiefs maximum points when they drew 1-1 in their Absa Premiership clash at Harry Gwala Stadium yesterday. Man of the moment, Judas Moseamedi came back to haunt Chiefs fans again when he scored the equaliser on a half-hour mark. The lanky striker, who scored a brace to help Maritzburg boot out Amakhosi from the Telkom Knockout semi-final, cancelled Lebogang Manyama’s 20th minute opener. Amakhosi go into the Xmas break having opened a seven points gap between themselves and second placed Mamelodi Sundowns with 35 points from 14 matches. On the other hand, an impressive Maritzburg now occupy eighth position with 18 points from the same number of games. This was the second meeting between the two sides within a month. Having beaten Chiefs in the TKO, revenge was the order of the day as Ernst Middendorp’s charges were aiming to end the first round on a high note. Maritzburg could have snatched the three points in the second half, but Daylon Claasen missed a golden opportunity to put his side ahead in the 67th minute when his spot-kick was saved by Daniel Akpeyi. Chiefs were last in action a fort night ago when they claimed a 5-3 victory over Bloemfontein Celtic at Moses Mabhida Stadium. Amakhosi had talisman Khama Billiat back after the Zimbabwean was given rest just before their last match. However, Billiat did not finish the game as he was cramping and was replaced by Nkosingiphile Ngcobo in the 80th minutes. The Team of Choice were licking their wounds coming to this encounter after they were defeated 2-1 in the final of Telkom Knockout by Sundowns last weekend. In their meetings last season, Amakhosi got away with four points as they claimed the spoils at FNB Stadium after the encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium ended goalless.
