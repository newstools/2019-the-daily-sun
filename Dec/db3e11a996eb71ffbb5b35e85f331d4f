POLICE Minister Bheki Cele did a walkabout at uShaka Marine World in Durban yesterday to assure holidaymakers of efforts to make the city safe. Accompanied by KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula, Cele greeted and spoke to holidaymakers, asking them if they felt safe. The answer he got from most holidaymakers was they were happy with police visibility. One of them, Karabo Mokoena (44) from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said she had been staying at her cousin’s flat since she arrived in the coastal city on Monday. “I’ve been going to the beach since I came. It’s been nothing but fun. Police patrol every day and I feel safe. I haven’t seen any bad incidents,” she said. Another holidaymaker, Nokuzola Macingwane (36) from North West, said she arrived in Durban with her sisters on 17 December. She said they were enjoying themselves and hadn’t come across any trouble. “Police are everywhere and today the minister came to check on us,” she said. Cele said: “We’ve had several roadblocks across Durban and made several arrests for drunk driving. However, I’m happy with the fact that holidaymakers feel safe.”
