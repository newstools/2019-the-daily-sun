Who knew that our Miss Universe has a voice of gold? A video of newly crowned Miss Universe Zozibini Tunzi singing Nobody But You by Elle Tisane has been doing rounds on social media.  Most people have been mesmerised by her voice and just could not believe that Zozi is such a multi-talented individual.  Someone else also posted another video of Zozi singing Jennifer Hudson's Giving Myself. It seems, the world will soon discover that there is more to this queen of hearts.
