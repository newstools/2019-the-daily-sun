THE remains of a toddler found in Harrismith in the Free State are probably those of Liam Nortje, who went missing two years ago while in the care of his dad. This could likely close the chapter on the mystery surrounding the three-year-old’s disappearance. His dad Nantes (48) was last week found guilty of murder, despite the absence of a body. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Harrismith High Court. READ: RAPED TODDLER OUT OF HOSPITAL! A man walking his dog in a field in Intabazwe kasi found the remains in a shallow grave. Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said Liam’s mother Cheinelle Brooks (42) identified a pair of Spider-Man sandals found in the grave as Liam’s. She had reportedly bought them and he was wearing them when he disappeared. Mophiring said DNA testing would confirm whether the remains were those of Liam. Liam went missing in November 2017 after visiting his dad in Kestell, eastern Free State. Nantes and Brooks were in the middle of a divorce at the time. Nantes had refused to reveal Liam’s whereabouts since his arrest. He claimed, among other things, that Liam was alive and that he had given him to a childless couple living overseas. Judge Corne van Zyl ruled that Nantes had murdered Liam after kidnapping the boy. Nantes drove off with the boy and later called his estranged wife to tell her she’d never see their son again. – NEWS24
