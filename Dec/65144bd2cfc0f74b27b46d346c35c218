HER tenants have been refusing to pay rent for six years. So the mastandi tried to evict them but the couple wouldn’t budge. She even enlisted the assistance of the cops and community but it didn’t work. Now Nhlanhla Mofokeng (47) is owed R120 000 in outstanding rent. “They don’t pay rent but can afford to buy a crate of beers now and then. They’re just irresponsible,” she said.  Nhlanhla lives in an RDP house, while the tenants live in a two-roomed house on the premises. She said she was no longer free in her yard as she allegedly endured insults from the tenants. “They tell me they’re not going anywhere,” she said. Nhlanhla from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, said the tenants wasted water and electricity without paying a cent. “I had to cut their electricity because I’m the only one who buys it,” she said.  Tenant Rocky Khuzwayo said they would not pay. “This house was empty when we came here and this is not her place,” said Rocky. Ekurhuleni Municipality said Nhlanhla should approach the court for an eviction order.
