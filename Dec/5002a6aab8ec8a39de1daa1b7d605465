ZIMBABWE international Ovidy Karuru has joined Stellenbosch FC. This comes after Karuru recently cut ties with Durban-based PSL side AmaZulu a few days ago after both parties agreed to part company. The former Kaizer Chiefs winger told Zimbabwean media outlets: “After we agreed with AmaZulu I immediately signed with Stellenbosch. I signed the contract at my home. “As a footballer, you always want to play where you are loved. They (Stellies) have been chasing my signature since they were promoted, but previously I would refer them to AmaZulu. “Stellenbosch want me to join them on 28 December (for) training and that is how serious they were with me. So I’m excited.” The 30-year-old had been with Usuthu for three and half seasons. He joined AmaZulu in the second half of 2016-17 season when they were participating in the now GladAfrica Championship (second tier league). Karuru asked to leave Usuthu as he said it was time to face new challenges. He revealed he had received many offers, although the deal with Stellies appears now to be concluded. Karuru is set to join Granwald Scott at the club and both players will be confirmed when the January transfer window opens in the next few days. Scott’s contract with Bidvest Wits is reported to end on 31 December and the experienced 32-year-old former Ajax Cape Town midfielder is keen to return to Cape Town where he was born and spent 11 years at Ajax. He joined the Clever Boys in 2017. Stellies, who are looking to cement their place in the PSL, have not had it easy in the Absa Premiership since they were promoted at the end of last season. Steve Barker’s side have won just three league matches in 15 played so far with the return of 15 points. They are in 13th position, only two points ahead of bottom club Polokwane City. They will resume the second round of the league against Wits at Cape Town Stadium on 4 January.
