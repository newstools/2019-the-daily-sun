Former Cameroon and Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o has heaped praise on Lebogang Manyama, saying the Kaizer Chiefs midfielder is "one of the best players and one of the best team-mates I ever had." Eto'o is a four-time African Footballer of the Year and won plenty of titles in a glittering career that saw him play for some of Europe's top clubs, including Barcelona, Inter Milan and Chelsea. The now 38-year-old Eto'o played alongside Manyama when the two were together at Turkish club Konyaspor last year. The move to Europe did not work out that well for Manyama though as he only made a handful of appearances before returning home to sign for Kaizer Chiefs, where he is currently starring. Eto'o feels the South African was not given a enough opportunities to showcase his talent in the Turkish league. Speaking to media at an event in Durban, Eto'o said: "I think Manyama is one of the best players and one of the best team-mates I ever had, but the problem was there at the club, Konyaspor. "The coach did not give Manyama the opportunities to play, but everyday when he came to training, we asked ourselves, 'Why is this guy not playing?' "He is one of the best players in the team and one of the best team-mates I ever had." SOURCE:Â SPORT24
