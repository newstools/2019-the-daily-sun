A TYPHOON that swept across remote villages and popular tourist attractions on Christmas Day claimed at least 16 lives, authorities said yesterday. Typhoon Phanfone, with winds travelling at 195km an hour, tore roofs off houses and toppled electric poles in villages and towns in the Visayas.

Phanfone also hit Boracay, Coron and other holiday destinations famed for their white-sand beaches, popular with foreign tourists. The airport at Kalibo, which services Boracay, was also badly damaged, according to a Korean tourist who was stranded there and provided images to AFP. “Roads remain blocked but some efforts have been made to clear away the damage. It’s pretty bad,” Jung Byung Joon said. “Everything within 100m of the airport looks broken. “There are a lot of frustrated people at the airport as flights have been cancelled. “Taxis are still running but it’s windy and still raining so, no one wants to leave the airport, including me,” Jung said. Though much weaker, Phanfone tracked a similar path as Super Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7 300 people dead or missing in 2013. “It’s like the younger sibling of Haiyan. It’s less destructive but it followed a similar path,” Cindy Ferrer, an information officer at the Western Visayas region’s disaster officer, told AFP.
