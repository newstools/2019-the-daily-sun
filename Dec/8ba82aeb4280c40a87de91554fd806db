ROMEO Malepe and his partners are changing the name of their kota from Streetwise Kota to Kota Culture. Romeo, who is a DJ, producer and founder of the Sharpeville Food Festival, said KFC took them on for copyright infringements. READ: BHELE COMES OUT OF RETIREMENT As everything is digital, Romeo posted the proposal online and people loved it so much that they went to some of the restaurants to buy the kota.  They attended the kota festival and people showed support for them. “Instead of being excited, KFC was furious and wanted to know why we are using the word ‘Streetwise’. “When we thought we have caught their attention, they sent a six page legal paper telling us to stop what we were doing. “They told us about copyright infringement and that we couldn’t use the word ‘Streetwise’,” said Romeo. He said they had to change the name because they couldn’t take on a big company like KFC. “We are now Kota Culture,” he said. “The plan is to make gourmet kota. We want to change the kota game and we are on the right path. Fighting copyright laws will slow down our progress,” he said. Romeo said they now focused on positive things like the opening of a Sangoma Shop. Gerard du Plessis from Adams & Adams, who represent KFC, said he was pleased to hear that Romeo would stop to using their client’s trademarks and would change his company name.
