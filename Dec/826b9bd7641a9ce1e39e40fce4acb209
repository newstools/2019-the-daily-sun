We don't know the motive for this killing. They killed young people and an old man. Why they were killed, we don't know."Msomi said the remaining family members are now living in fear."They are very worried. This thing is terrible. They don't know why they were killed. Now that the day is almost over, they are not sure where to go. They don't know if the sun sets, what will happen if the same people will come back. They need protection."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-family-reeling-in-shock-after-five-relatives-shot-dead-while-watching-generations-20191212
