UNDER-FIRE Orlando Pirates interim coach Rhulani Mokwena is a disappointed man after his side failed to collect maximum points against Baroka. The Soweto giants drew 2-2 with Bakgaga in their Absa Premiership clash played on Saturday at Peter Mokaba Stadium, despite leading 2-0 with eight minutes to go. “This is a game we should have easily won,” said Mokwena. “There was one team in this game which was Pirates. We cannot lead by two goals and end up drawing like this. This feels like a defeat to me. I am very disappointed. But it is what it is.” He added: “I think we have a problem in defence and we should work on it. We will continue doing our best and fight for this club.” Pirates goals were scored by Linda Mntambo and Kabelo Dlamini while their defender and captain Happy Jele scored an own goal for Baroka.

Meanwhile, Baroka head coach Wedson Nyirenda backed Mokwena and appealed to Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza to keep his trust in Mokwena. “I think the young man is doing a good job,” said Nyirenda. “And if you cannot see it I don’t know what to say to you. Pirates are playing good football and you see what this young man is trying to do. Every coach has his own style of play. “He took the team in the middle of the war. He did not have time prepare and people need to be patient. I see great thing coming for Pirates under Mokwena.”
