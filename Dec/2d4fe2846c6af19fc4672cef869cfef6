RAPPER Thuto “Solid T” Mokgwabone was inspired by the late HHP. The 26-year-old said he and the famous motswako rapper, whose real name was Jabulani Tsambo, were from the same province so he could relate to his work. Solid T from Mahikeng in North West said: “HHP’s music always had meaning and relevance in the sense that I could relate to what he was rapping about. “He used to speak about the social issues we face daily. “HHP cared about people, did community work and came up with solutions to help society grow spiritually and mentally. “That’s when I decided to follow the motswako genre so I could also inspire and motivate the less fortunate. I started writing songs around 2006 when I was 13 years old.” He said he started recording in 2008. That’s when he released his first song titled Amazing, featuring Obakeng Moribe. In 2014 he released another single titled Inspiration And Motivation. The rapper released Soldier in 2016, alongside Super Producer Rapz. Last month, Solid T released a new single titled Monate. “I have a show called Superstar Talent Show that I host annually in March back at home in Mafikeng unit 14,” he said. “The aim is to give artists a platform to show their talents and bring industry friends to come to share some advice. “I always try to motive and spread knowledge on my social media platforms on how to get better at what you do.” He said he’d love to work with famous artists such as Nasty C, Soweto Gospel Choir, AKA and Lira. “These artists make great music. I would also love to work with anyone who wants to work with me as long as the energy allows. I’m looking forward to working with a lot of talented artists from this continent.”
