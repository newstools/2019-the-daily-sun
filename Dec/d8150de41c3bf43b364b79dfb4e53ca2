FRITZ Joubert (45), who murdered sangoma Anele Hoyana (40), had an outstanding case of assault in Bloemfontein. Joubert allegedly assaulted a white man at a food outlet early this year. According to a source, the men had argued over a parking spot. “Joubert assaulted him and left with his car keys,” said the source. He said the man reported him to the police and Joubert was found in the Eastern Cape and arrested. “He got bail and was awaiting trial,” said the source.  “Joubert resolved almost everything through violence. If you talked back against him, you would have a serious problem.” Daily Sun could not find the complainant on the assault case. After murdering Anele, Joubert was shot by police. Free State NPA spokesman Phaladi Shuping told Daily Sun the case would be heard in January. Shuping said the case would carry on until the prosecutor was presented with Joubert’s death certificate before the court could strike the case off the roll.  A source told Daily Sun there was a possibility that Anele was supposed to cleanse Joubert and make him strong to win the case. “I think he should have seen that Joubert was dangerous and should have left early,” said the source. “The signs were there. They argued a lot.” Anele’s murder took place on Saturday and left Mzansi shocked.  It was recorded on video and shared on social media platforms. Police told Daily Sun the investigation was continuing. Police spokesman Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana said cases of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and inquest were registered for investigation.
