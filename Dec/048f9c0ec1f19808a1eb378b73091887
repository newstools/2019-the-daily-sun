TOKELO Rantie’s future with Mamelodi Sundowns is no longer certain. The troublesome midfielder could have his contract terminated after he went AWOL. Rantie appeared before the club’s disciplinary hearing yesterday, facing several charges including absconding from work. Sundowns legal head Yogesh Singh confirmed the former Bafana Bafana striker is facing the music over his conduct. “Yes, he is appearing before the DC. He has been absent without informing the club,” said Singh. Rantie was thrown a lifeline early this season, signing a three-year deal with the Brazilians after he proved his fitness and a willingness to revive his fading career. But he appears to have gone back to his old wayward ways, much to the disappointment of coach Pitso Mosimane. “I haven’t seen him. Maybe you can locate him, but we will see,” said Mosimane. “I believe that we can’t hold somebody to what he has done in the past. We all know that he has had big challenges in the past, but somebody has to give a helping hand and probably that somebody is me. Mosimane frowns upon ill-discipline and Rantie may have ended his career at Chloorkop. It is not the first time that the Parys-born striker finds himself in hot water over his waywardness. He had problems during his time with Turkish club Genclerbirgli where he also went AWOL over a year ago. This was after he was given time off for a family bereavement funeral. But low and behold, Rantie never went back to honour his contract. He signed with Cape Town City as a free agent last season, but had his contract terminated due to “personal reasons”. With undoubted talent, Rantie earned 40 Bafana caps, scoring 12 goals since his debut seven years ago. He has also played for Swedish club Malmo FF before joining English side Bournemouth in 2013.
