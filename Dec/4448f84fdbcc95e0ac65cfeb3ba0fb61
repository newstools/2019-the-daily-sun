Renowned Portugal-born DJ and producer Tiago “DJeff” Barros is bringing out his boundless energy to Mzansi. DJeff will headline the eighth annual star-studded Soshanguve 1st Funday gig on New Year’s Day. The DJ is seen as a symbol of African cultural heritage in Portugal’s bustling capital, Lisbon. He has also endeared himself to fans by the intricate way he mixes various musical genres. DJeff has been allocated a two-hour set at the Soshanguve jamboree. He will play solo in the first hour and be joined by DJ Shimza, Mzansi’s finest, in the second. Speaking to SunBuzz, DJeff said it felt good to be featured among acts such as Busiswa, Mdu Masilela, Zola 7, Black Motion, Brenden Praise, Scorpion Kings, Culoe De Song and DBN Gogo at this year’s event. He said he appreciated the respect the organisers had showed him. “This is a special moment for me. I’ve followed the history of this event. I’m honoured to be called up. It will be my first time playing in Mzansi,” he said. “I was here a few times before but only on holiday. So, I see this as my first time.” DJeff, who jetted into South Africa a few days ago and had been touring the country with award-winning group Black Motion, said his stay so far had been amazing. “I’ve been to different parties and different crowds. “I’ve been loving the experience since day one. I expect Soshanguve 1st Funday to be a special event. Music lovers can expect an Afro tech set full of energy and good vibe. Most of the music I play is from South Africa, so I think people will like it.” He’s excited he will play with Shimza. “We always have fun when we play together. At this point in our lives, it’s not only about just playing; it’s also about the connection you feel with the person you’re sharing the decks with.”
