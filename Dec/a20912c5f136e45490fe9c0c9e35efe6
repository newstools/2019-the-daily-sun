Investigators from the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) are inspecting the damages on the M1 South Booysens off-ramp bridge which collapsed on Christmas day. The chaos on South African roads, which has become a staple of festive season travel, has taken yet another worrying turn in Johannesburg. While the cause of the structural damage is not yet known, former City Mayor, Herman Mashaba, had warned that bridges and off-ramps in Joburg were in dire condition, lacking proper maintenance and reinforcement. Chief of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD), David Tembe, conducted a site visit to the M1 South Booysens off-ramp bridge on Wednesday night and reported that while the brick undercarriage had suffered damage, there was no immediate danger of a total collapse. Concern over the state of the bridge comes at a critical time for Joburg residents, visitors and motorists passing through during the festive period. Traffic volumes are expected to increase dramatically over the next few weeks, as holiday makers return home.
