JOHN Sibitana (50) and Moses Lubisi (51) want the health department to lift their 2014 suspension after they had refused to work overtime. They said they were employed as drivers for patient transport at Tonga Hospital in 2004 and the department defied orders from the then MEC Gillion Mashego, who instructed that they be reinstated. John and Moses from Malelane, Mpumalanga, said they were paid their salaries for two years while on suspension. They claimed the department suspended four of them but the other two were reinstated in 2017, while they were left out without any valid reason. “We tried everything we could to force the department to give us our jobs back, but nothing happened,” Moses said. “Our families are hungry. We’ve run out of money to pay lawyers. “All we want is for the department to take us back. Our only sin was to stop working overtime as the department wasn’t paying for it.” Moses said they were told refusing to work overtime was putting patients’ lives at risk. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said the two men were charged for insubordination of authority and dereliction of duty, and subjected to disciplinary processes in the department. They were found guilty and immediately dismissed from public service. “They appealed the decision with the executing authority and the dismissal decision was affirmed. “The matter was taken up for external arbitration and the two lost the case and remained dismissed. The matter is closed,” he said.
