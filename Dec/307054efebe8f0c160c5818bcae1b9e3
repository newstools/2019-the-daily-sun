SINGING sensation Mlindo The Vocalist was forced to miss some performances after he had a car accident on Friday. But his manager Nyiko Bilankulu said he wasn’t badly injured and would be discharged from hospital in a day or two. “We were together in the car but I wasn’t injured. Doctors just checked me and I was released on the same day. As for Mlindo, his fans should rest assured he will be on stage soon.” Mlindo, whose real name is Lindokuhle Magedezi, said on social media he and his team were involved in a crash after their performance at 529 Social in Morningside in Durban on Friday. “We’ve been hospitalised until further notice, which puts us in a predicament as we had to cancel some performances. “To all my fans, I deeply apologise for the inconvenience. Please keep us in your prayers for a speedy recovery.” Mlindo gained nationwide fame when his single Amablesser, from his debut album Emakhaya, became an instant hit. He has since released hot singles such as Bamthathile with DJ and producer Sun-El Musician, as well as Macala, Imoto and Egoli featuring Sjava. This year, he earned nominations in the Best Newcomer of the Year, Best Produced Album and Best Afro Pop Album categories at the Samas.
