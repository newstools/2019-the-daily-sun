This is Cardi's first time on the African continent, and she said on IG she wants to experience the "real" Nigeria ... not just a hotel. The Award-winning Rapper has been showing off Nigeria to her 55 million followers!, the star is impressed with what the country has to offer. Cardi's performed at the Livespot X Festival Saturday in Lagos, and then in neighboring Ghana this Sunday. If her Insta stories are anything to go by, Cardi is already making history if you ask the dancers inside the club, she took over Friday night in the city of Lagos.  Not only did seemingly every stripper jump in a giant selfie with the rapper, but they went home covered in naira. While the DJ pumped Cardi's music, every stripper got a chance to entertain the queen. But thats not all Cardi B has been getting up to, despite turning up, the Rapper took time to give. She visited a childrens home in Nigeria and brought gifts! "Gotta thank the ladies and the gentlemen that nurtured these kids that need just a little bit of more love and protection and gear them up for a better place ,destiny and future.
