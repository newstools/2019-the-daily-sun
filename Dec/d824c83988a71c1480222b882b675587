TWENTY families have been left homeless after a fire ate their shacks and killed a teenager in KwaZakhele, Port Elizabeth, on Monday. Captain Andre Beetge said: “The fire started at about 1.30pm and spread to 20 shacks in the Ndulini informal area. “Witnesses heard the screams of Zintle Zabo (14), who was trapped in a burning shack. Attempts were made to break open the door, but the fire was raging and spread quickly to surrounding shacks.” Beetge said the teenager died and 20 shacks were destroyed, leaving more than 100 residents homeless. Assistance has been offered to the victims, who’re still trying to pick up the pieces. “The police would like to thank Nelson Mandela Bay Disaster Management for their response, as well as the ward councillor and Triple Care for their assistance with blankets and mattresses, as well as the Somali society, which donated food,” he said. “There remains a need for clothing, bedding and food. Anyone who wants to help can call Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Norman on 082 457 2868 or visit New Brighton Police Station.”
