SEVEN struggling brothers will finally have food after receiving groceries from a Good Samaritan on Tuesday. And on top of this, Sassa promised to help get them new grant cards. The brothers were left hopeless after their mum died last year. A relative allegedly took their Sassa cards to repay herself for her contributions to their mum’s funeral. On Monday, Daily Sun published an article about how the siblings from Botshabelo, Mangaung, were left with no income. The relative denied taking three of their Sassa cards, but said she spent a lot of cash on burying their mum. Thabang Pela, the owner of Pela Property Solutions in Bloemfontein, said he stepped in to help after reading about their situation in the People’s Paper. “I went to visit the family and what I saw hurt me. “They were sleeping on the floor and didn’t have enough clothes. I started by giving them groceries but I will try to help them with clothes as well.” The boys’ 40-year-old brother, who was unemployed, said they were grateful to Daily Sun. “I also want to thank the paramedics who first shared our story on Facebook. “We will not have to go to bed with hungry stomachs. I thank God my younger brothers will have eggs and beans,” he said. Free State Sassa spokeswoman Motshewa Maleka said the family’s situation had been assessed. “We are going to help them with new Sassa cards and the cards the other person has will be useless. A new guardian will be appointed for the family by a social worker.”
