OVER 600 bidders flocked to the Bosasa head office, known at the Smart Global Campus, for day one of the auction of the decade yesterday. They forked out R20 000 each to battle it out for over 140 commercial and passengers vehicles. All eyes were on the late Gavin Watson’s beast of a car, a BMW X5 5.0I and Porsche Cayenne, which were the most expensive cars. The Beamer was sold for R590 000, while the Porsche went under the hammer for R500 000. Another bargain for the day was a 2011 Audi S5 with 169 000km on the clock. It was sold for only R125 000. Toyotas dominated the auction as Fortuners, Yarises, Avanzas and Corollas as well as Hilux bakkies, sold for R60 000 and R160 000. Those who wanted to buy more than three cars had to fork out an extra R20 000. Park Village Auctions’ Clive Lazarus said, “Today, about 350 motor vehicles are going on auction today. “Tomorrow it’s the buildings, the campus that we’re sitting on today and the other two properties.” He said furniture would be auctioned today and the remaining furniture will be sold again on Friday. “All items will be sold free of encumbrance whatsoever so people will be given title and delivery of the goods they purchased here today.”
