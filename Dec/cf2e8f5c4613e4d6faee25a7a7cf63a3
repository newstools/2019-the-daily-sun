PITSO Mosimane has not only made a name for himself in South Africa, but in the entire African continent. “Jingles” as he is affectionately known, is one of the most respected and celebrated coaches on the continent. And this was evident once again on Saturday when a packed Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca, Morocco was chanting his name. This was after Mosimane’s Mamelodi Sundowns held Wydad Casablanca to a 0-0 draw away from home. Wydad’s fans could not help but show their admiration for Mosimane, for whom they clearly have a lot of respect. Over the past few years, Mosimane has seen his Downs side face Wydad nine times. Over that period, he has managed to endear himself on the opposition fans as a result of his love for the continent and of course, his outstanding work. He helped Downs win their maiden Caf Champions League title in 2016 and has since made the Tshwane giants a force on the continent.
