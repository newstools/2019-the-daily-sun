BLACK Leopards coach Luc Eymael believes the club has a precious find in Lesedi Kapinga. The 24-year-old attacking midfielder has been impressive for Leopards this season. His outstanding displays saw him receiving praise from coach Eymael who believes that Kapinga is capable of becoming the next big thing for Mzansi. Talking after their 3-1 defeat to Orlando Pirates at the weekend the former Free State Stars mentor said Kapinga could be the next Percy Tau who is now playing Uefa Champions League Football. “I don’t like to talk too much about one or two players but Kapinga is a very promising player. He is a very good number 10 who can also play as a winger. I think he can become in the future another Percy Tau that is my thinking. He just needs good coaches.” He went on: “He’s a shy but very talented boy. Sometimes he is too relaxed and casual at training, but if he can learn a bit about my mentality and have the necessary hunger he will go far.” Eymael and his charges went to the Christmas recess sitting in 11th position in the Absa Premiership table. Lidoda Duvha have managed to accumulate 16 points from 14 outings. In January they will be looking to improve that when the second round resumes as they have a date with Highland Park on 5 January. With the transfer window period opening, Eymael is not sure if he will be adding new players or not. Eymael revealed that he has met with the chairman of the club (David Thidiela) to discuss which players to sign and which to let go. He said: “We had one or two meetings with the chairman. I give my opinion. I know some players will go out. I have my idea but the chairman has the final decision.” The ex FS Stars coach also squashed rumours that midfield maestro, Siphelele Ntshangase is set for a Leopards return. He stated: “I have read in the newspapers and website that Ntshangase is coming back and I do not know anything about that.”
