Mamelodi Sundowns have confirmed that striker Emiliano Tade has been released from his contract. The Argentine forward joined Masadawana in January but has found his playing time limited due to what the club described as "niggling injuries". The 31-year-old joined the Tshwane club from AmaZulu after impressing in a match against the defending league champions. Tade made a total of eight appearances for Sundowns last season, scoring one goal and providing one assist, but found his playing time curtailed since the start of the current campaign. On Wednesday Sundowns released a statement on their website which reads: "Mamelodi Sundowns' Argentine forward, Emiliano Tade approached the club to be released from his contract and the club has conceded after the player cited personal reasons. "The president, Patrice Motsepe, the board, management, staff, coaches and players wish to thank Emiliano Tade for his contribution and wish him all of the best in his personal and professional endeavours."
