She told Daily Sun although she’d miss their sex life, she couldn’t stay with someone accused of robbing people. Sisinyana said her lover left on Friday after they’d been living together for five years. “I liked him a lot as he helped me with chores and was a beast in bed,” she told the People’s Paper. “I’ve been wheelchair-bound since I had a stroke a few years ago. “Last month people started warning me my Ben 10 was a thug.” Sisinyana said things came to a head on Friday when a group of angry people, carrying stones and weapons, came to her house looking for the Ben 10 . “They were baying for blood and said he’d robbed the wrong people this time. They said he mugged their friend at knifepoint.” “I don’t want him anymore. I’d rather be lonely than injured or killed for something I didn’t do.” READ: MLUNGU KILLS SANGOMA AFTER CLEANSING CEREMONY!
