THERE were celebratory scenes when kids, gogos and madalas were showered with Christmas goodies at the weekend. About 400 kids from Groot Marico, North West, received schoolbags, school uniforms and snacks. The elderly smiled all the way back home with blankets and groceries from Chinese organisations. Gogo Florah Jansen’s face lit up when she was given a blanket and groceries. “The blanket looks warm and beautiful. I’m sure I’ll sleep comfortably in it. I love it,” she said. Her neighbour, Annah Mogaladi, said this was going to be the best Christmas ever. “My grandchildren and I don’t have money to buy groceries. I’m very grateful for the gifts from Chinese businesses,” she said. Schoolchildren ran around the building, comparing their new schoolbags and uniforms. Lerato Maakgwana said: “I’m no longer going to use a plastic bag to carry my books to school. I’ll take good care of my new schoolbag.” North West Premier Job Mokgoro said he appreciated the kind gesture. “The Chinese saw it necessary, in the spirit of the festive season, to make a gesture to the poor people of Groot Marico. We are grateful,” he said. Mokgoro said his government and its stakeholders would look at exchanging ideas about helping the poor in the province. Chinese ambassador Lin Songtian said the donations were a way for Chinese and South Africans to unite. “This is the right way of celebrating Christmas. Now’s the time for us to work together and take action so the people can benefit from the land.” Social Development MEC Boitumelo Moiloa said more than 600 families were assisted.
