The 24th installment of the annual Joyous Celebration album was aired on SABC1 on Wednesday and tweeps weren't impressed. Joyous Celebration 24: The Rock was recorded two weeks back at Sun City in North West. SABC1 showed some of the songs in the recording. Singers such as SbuNoah, Londiwe Cele, Given Mabena and Siyakha Khitha took the stage. However, most people weren't impressed by the group and theie performances.       Some tweeps supported Joyous Celebration though and said they enjoyed the performances.
