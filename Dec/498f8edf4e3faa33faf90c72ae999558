MORE than 100 000 worshippers are expected to gather for a night service on New Year’s Eve at FNB Stadium, Joburg. It will be led by Prophet Shepherd Bushiri of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church. This year’s service is known as Night of God’s Open Hands. READ: RAGE OVER KFC WEDDING! Besides local worshippers, 30 000 people from 30 countries are expected to attend the service. The service is in its fourth year. Last year it took place at Tshwane Events Centre. Church spokesman Ephraim Nyondo said people who would be attending needed to arrange their own food, accommodation, drinks and transportation. “The church can’t manage all the people. We urge people to be extra careful where they seek accommodation and transportation. “They’re also welcome to bring blankets to the stadium for the night service. “Gates will open at 9am and the service will start at about 4pm and continue into the early hours of the morning. “The prophet will open the service with a speech and he will also lead the service,” said Nyondo. On Bushiri’s Facebook page, he said 2019 was a great year. “The enemy rose against us, yes, but our God gave us victory after victory. We saw His faithfulness, and indeed, when God opens a door, nobody can shut it,” he said. “It matters most how you start and end your year.” READ: PABALLO'S LOVER: MY WIFE DIDN'T KILL HER!
