MAMELODI Sundowns have written to the PSL requesting for their league match against Stellenbosch FC to be reinstated. The Brazilians had asked the League to postpone their 11 December fixture against Stellies to allow sufficient time to prepare for the upcoming Telkom Knockout final. The PSL granted Sundowns their wish and moved the match.But due to a plenty of games coming up in the New Year, Sundowns are now willing to play Stellies on the set date at Cape Town Stadium. Sundowns will face Maritzburg United in the TKO final at Moses Mabhida Stadium on 14 December. The League usually give teams a full week to prepare for a cup final, but that may not be the case for the Tshwane giants. “Sundowns have written to the PSL for their game against Stellenbosch to be brought back,” said the source. “The PSL has agreed and the game is now back on the 11th.” This doesn’t come as a surprise for Sundowns and very considerate from the side of the PSL.
