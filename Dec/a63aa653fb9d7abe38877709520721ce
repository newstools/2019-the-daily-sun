 A 37-year-old man in Bela-Bela, Limpopo died in an alleged
suicide. He reportedly intentionally drove onto oncoming traffic and
crushed head on with a truck. The horrific car crash happened on R516 Rooiberg road
outside Bela-Bela. Cops spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the man
drove away from his family house in Extension 8, Bela-Bela township in their
family car (Datsun) after he allegedly strangled his wife and his stepdaughter to
death inside the house. He told Daily Sun that: "It is alleged that
neighbours became very suspicious and went to check at the house where they
found a woman lying dead on the kitchen floor inside a locked house and
immediately contacted the Police." "On arrival, the police had to use force to open the
door and discovered both bodies in the kitchen and bedroom," Mojapelo
said. He added that their investigations indicated the two might
have been strangled. "We have opened two cases of murder and one of culpable
homicide that are now being investigated. The motive behind the incident is
still unknown at this stage but domestic violence cannot be ruled out." Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke
Ledwaba warned community members to stop resorting to violence and instead seek
professional assistance.
