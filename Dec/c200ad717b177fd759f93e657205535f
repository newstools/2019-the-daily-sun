THE EFF threw away the opportunity to run the Tshwane Metro on principle as it refused to back newly elected Joburg mayor Geoff Makhubo. EFF leader Julius Malema saidit was a done deal between his party and the ANC that EFF would have Tshwane in exchange for Joburg for the ANC.

We can’t, I am sorry,” said Malema, responding to a question of a lost chance for the party to govern. He said people were going to ask why the party voted for a “corrupt” person, while they had their own candidate, Musa Novela, who was not compromised. He explained that in agreeing with the ANC on Makhubo, they’d put him in charge of a metro he was alleged to have defrauded last year. Makhubo was reportedly implicated in a fraud scam where his accompany, Molelwane Consulting, received R30 million from a Gupta-linked company after it was allegedly used as a front. Makhubo had since denied this and earlier this week tweeted that an ANC internal process cleared him and a report in this regard would be released soon by the party. But Malema told the People’s Paper there was no way they were going to support him to replace the much-loved former Joburg mayor, Herman Mashaba.
