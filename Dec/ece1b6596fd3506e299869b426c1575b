VETERAN striker Siyabonga “Bhele” Nomvethe has come out of retirement to join GladAfrica early pacesetters Uthongathi. The 42-year-old former Bafana Bafana striker retired from football at the end of last season while playing for AmaZulu. Nomvethe’s return to action means he is now the oldest player to play in the PSL. However, SunSport has been informed that Bhele who started his illustrious football career at the age of 21, playing for African Wanderers has joined GladAfrica early side. The insider says the club roped him to add experience in the team and also motivate young players as they are gunning for automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership. “Bhele has joined the team he arrived this week,” said the insider. “But he will not play this weekend in our last match of the first round. "He will start playing when we come back from Christmas recess.” Another experienced pair of players who have joined the club are former Golden Arrows midfielders Thanduyise Khuboni and Sandile Zuke. Zuke will travel with the team that will face JDR Stars on Saturday in their last GladAfrica match for the year. The match will be played at Giant Stadium in Soshanguve at 3.30pm.
