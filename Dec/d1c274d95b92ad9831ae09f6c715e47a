Famous Twitter user who goes by the name Daniel Marven doesn't understand the hype and has dubbed DJ Cleo one of the most “useless South African DJs”, in a now deleted tweet. I’ll keep it simple. I’m just as opinionated but you will never see me tweet my opinions on others because I respect their hustle. You’re entitled to an opinion,But fact is: that’s all it is...an opinionOne day when we bump into each other, repeat those words to my face  DJ Cleo took no time to put Daniel Marven in his place, saying: “I’ll keep it simple. I’m just as opinionated, but you will never see me tweet my opinions on others, because I respect their hustle.”He then told Marven his opinion meant nothing to him: “You’re entitled to an opinion, but the fact is, that’s all it is ... an opinion.One day when we bump into each other, repeat those words to my face.” Cleo was trending on Twitter last month after fans called on him to release a single for the festive season, this is when Daniel took the opportunity to take a jab on the artist. They flooded the social media streets and expressed dismay over Cleo not releasing new music like he used to, owning Dezemba over the years. Cleo is however rumoured to be working on new music!
