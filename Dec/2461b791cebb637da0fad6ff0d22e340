SIBUSISO Ncanana was a bubbly person who loved inviting friends over to his house, but it ended up costing him his life. The 28-year-old from Verulam, north of Durban, was allegedly shot on Saturday night by a jealous boyfriend who accused Sibusiso of poking his girlfriend. Sibusiso’s 26-year-old cousin said the suspect asked Sibusiso to go with him to ask his lover if they were dating.  “My cousin didn’t see a problem with it as he was not involved with this woman, but they didn’t even reach the woman’s house,” he said. “On the way the suspect took out his gun and pointed it at Sibusiso.” The cousin said while Sibusiso was trying to explain nothing was going on, the suspect shot him in the head. “The suspect disappeared into a nearby forest and we haven’t seen the woman since the incident.  “Maybe she fears for her life and went into hiding.” The SunTeam tried to get hold of the man’s girlfriend without any luck. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a murder case was opened by Verulam cops
