THE uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association is to host a national celebration at Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown, Soweto, today. The celebration will be held under the auspices of the ANC’s peace and stability sub-committee. Tony Yengeni, the sub-committee’s chairman, said the gathering would be held at a challenging time for the ANC and its alliance partners. “It’s at a time when the ANC is being challenged to renew and unite its bases for a final assault on the forces of reaction for the total liberation of the poorest of the poor from poverty, joblessness and inequality,” he told journalists yesterday at Luthuli House in Joburg. He said the event would commemorate the establishment of uMkhonto weSizwe 58 years ago and to honour all the people who laid down their lives for freedom. Yengeni was joined by military veterans Johannes Rasegatla, Kebby Maphatsoe, Siphiwe Nyanda and Carl Niehaus. “After the banning of the ANC and other political organisations and their leaders were arrested, tortured and sentenced to long-term imprisonment, the liberation movement decided that the struggle for liberation had to continue but had to include armed methods of struggle. That is when the Spear of the Nation, uMkhonto weSizwe, was born on 16 December 1961,” Yengeni said. He said MK combatants played a crucial role during the struggle by uniting the ANC and mobilising support for the people of South Africa outside the country.
