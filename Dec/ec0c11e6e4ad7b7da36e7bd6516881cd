The Supreme Court of Appeal has set aside the attempted murder conviction against Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson in the coffin assault case. Nevertheless, Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson are still convicted of assault, grievous bodily harm, kidnapping and other convictions. The court however, reduced the duoâ€™s prison terms to five years.  In 2017, Oosthuizen and Jackson were sentenced to 11 years and 14 years behind bars. Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Jackson were convicted of assaulting Victor and shoving him into a coffin, threatening to pour petrol over him and set him alight. They had forced Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatened to pour petrol over him. The incident was filmed, and the video went viral on social media, sparking an outcry and demands for justice.
