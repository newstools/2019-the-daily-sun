KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi and Bishop Makamu have such a striking resemblance...maybe they're long lost brothers. Akpeyi was born in Nnewi in Nigeria and he has staked his claim in the Amakhosi team - he is also an international player for the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Makamu is a successful Bishop and he runs the thriving Endless Hope Bible Church in Alberton on the East Rand. He also hosts TV show Rea Tsotella and this has given him a celebrity status in Mzansi showbizz. Do you agree with our observation that Akpeyi and Makamu look like siblings?
