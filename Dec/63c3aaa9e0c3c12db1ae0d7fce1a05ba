IT is not every day that a coach empathise with his counterpart in the “dog-eat-dog” Caf Champions League. But Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane may well have further enhanced his growing popularity on the continent. Sundowns secured a massive away win as they edged USM Alger 1-0 in their recent group C encounter in Algeria, victory achieved through Hlompho Kekana’s quick-thinking after he latched onto a poor back-pass, rounded the goalkeeper, before scoring the only goal of the match. Mosimane was quick to extend words of comfort to Alger coach Boualem Chendri for the manner of the loss. “I feel for the coach because Mustapha (Alger defender) made a mistake,” said Mosimane. “It is the lives of the coaches. We suffer like that when players make mistakes. ”Sundowns are top of the group C on seven points after three matches. But Mosimane has warned against complacency as there are still three more games to be played. Mosimane said: “I don’t think we are in the quarterfinals yet. It’s still early.”
