WHEN many families were enjoying Christmas Day, some residents from the KZN south coast were rebuilding their homes. Heavy storms hit the South Coast on Christmas Eve, causing havoc in areas such as Ibisi, KwaMeyi and KwaJames in Umzimkhulu. The incident left Mlozana Primary School and 308 houses damaged, leaving 32 families homeless. Since Christmas Day, the residents have been rebuilding their homes.The families were now sheltered in local halls. When he visited the area on Wednesday, KZN MEC for Traditional Affairs Sipho Hlomuka said the disaster relief packages for the affected families were being distributed. These include roof sheeting, food and blankets. “We’re thankful there were no fatalities and those who were injured were quickly rushed to hospital and have received proper medical care,” he said. Hlomuka said it was sad that instead of celebrating Christmas Day, 308 families were now forced to rebuild their homes. The KZN Cogta spokesman Senzelwe Mzila said “In Mpangeni over 30 people died when a church collapsed.” Resident Nhlanhla Mhlongo (37) said: “There is also no electricity, but we are grateful that the MEC came and offered to help us.” Another resident Zola Dladla (44), from Nokweja Village, said at his three-roomed house, with furniture, was damaged and they moved everything into one room.
