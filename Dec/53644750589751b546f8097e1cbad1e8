JUSTICE Minister Ronald Lamola announced in Tshwane yesterday that FeesMustFall activist Kanya Cekeshe would go home soon. Lamola was giving an in-depth explanation of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that he decided to grant special remission of sentence to specific categories of sentenced offenders, probationers and parolees. Lamola announced 14 647 inmates were eligible for special remissions. “A total 21,81% or 51 036 of South Africa’s total offender population of 233 945 including parolees will be considered for pardons and remissions.” He said Cekeshe was now immediately eligible for parole. He said the activist would qualify after granting him special remission for 12 months of his remaining jail sentence. Cekeshe was due for parole in February after spending two years of his eight-year sentence in prison. He was sentenced for setting alight a police vehicle, a charge he pleaded guilty to. Lamola said Cekeshe’s reported mental breakdown would be considered as a factor when processing the remission of his sentence. “I won’t comment on whether he’ll be released before Christmas or not.” It was also announced AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo qualified for parole. Lamola said Dalindyebo’s parole application for a presidential pardon was still on the table. “He does get special remission, 12 months shaved off. He was eligible for parole.” Dalindyebo was convicted in 2009 for offences including kidnapping, assault and defeating the ends of justice. Lamola said it was important to note that special remissions would only benefit those who qualified as per the criteria. “Sexual offenders, child abusers, armed robbers, murderers and those sentenced for life will not benefit from this process.”
