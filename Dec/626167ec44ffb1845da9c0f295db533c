FORMER SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng is unhappy with government’s treatment of struggle hero Solly Mokoetle’s funeral. Following a service at Noordgesig Hall in Soweto, the MK soldier and former SABC CEO was buried at West Park Cemetery yesterday. He died two weeks ago. The ANC Women’s League, MK veterans and politicians attended the funeral. Motsoeneng said: “Mokoetle was a very special person. It’s a shame government did not give him a dignified provincial funeral.” Bishop Pule Magethi told mourners people needed to go back to their roots.  “Let’s go back to doing things the way we used to. How many of us go to comfort the bereaved family? “Do you go to funerals of ordinary people? There were many speakers here, but how many of them even knew where Mokoetle’s house is? That’s unAfrican.” Mokoetle was born in Orlando East in Soweto in 1965 and joined the ANC as a teenager. He spent 20 years in exile. At the time of his death, he was married to Zola Ntuli. In exile, he worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and was key in Radio Freedom’s first broadcast. In 1994, he joined the SABC as a general manager, later becoming chief operating officer and CEO.
