THEY sleep with men for as little as R5 to get money for their next fix. But the nyaope addicts said they’ve had enough and wanted help. Modiehi Lefakane (24) from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, said she started smoking weed when she was 16 and later graduated to nyaope. She said her parents kicked her out of home because she stole. “I had nowhere to go and the only way to get money was to sleep with men,” she said. Modiehi was now sleeping in an abandoned building in Duduza with other nyaope addicts.  She said when other addicts hustled during the day, she sold her body.  Zodwa Ntuli (28), an orphan, said she felt guilty after sleeping with men. “Being down can make you do things you never thought you would do. Life is hard without parents. Poverty and stress got me hooked,” she said. FIVE DIE IN HORROR CRASH! Five people died, including two Pakistani nationals, horror crash on the N4 in Rustenburg.  Zodwa lives with her younger brother, who said he wished she could find help. “I want to focus on my studies to change the situation at home,” he said. Pastor Andile Madiba said most kids in Duduza were driven to smoke nyaope because of their family circumstances. “I have a centre where we work with social workers. We’re proud to say some decided to quit and are leading productive lives,” said Madiba. Thabiso Hlongwane of Social Development said addicts needed to make the decision to quit.
