A SPECIAL kind of joy was presented to hundreds of mothers as Christmas Day marked the arrival of new babies. The KZN MEC for Health Nomagugu Simelane Zulu welcomed 81 bundles of joy which were born across KZN today. 43 were girls and 38 were boys. Speaking at the Estcourt Hospital in KZN where she welcomed and handed out gifts to the bundles of joy that were born on this year's Christmas Day, MEC Simelane-Zulu issued a strong warning against men who impregnate girls under the age of 16 years. She said they will be charged for statutory rape. MEC Simelane-Zulu described statutory rape as a form of Gender-Based Violence. Meanwhile, MEC Simelane Zulu said the first two Christmas babies were born on the stroke of midnight at Queen Nandi Memorial Hospital. "And at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Durban twin girls were born at 01:52, and at 2am a baby girl was born by a 14-year-old mother at Vryheid Hospital and the father is 18-years-old," she said. She said other young Christmas Day mothers includes a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old. "We are worried about the ages of some of the mothers. The likelihood is that the 14-year-old mother could have been impregnated at the age of 13 years. That is statutory rape," she said. She said they call upon communities to stop the tendency of accepting damages. "We know that in some areas, once a perpetrator realises their victim is pregnant, they suddenly come to the family and pay damages. That is against the law," she said. She said even if the father is 18-years-old, having sex with a 13-year-old is statutory rape. "Men must understand that at that particular age, whether you say the child ‘agreed’ or not, it’s still rape," she said. However, the mothers who gave birth on Christmas Day welcomed the gifts. One of the mothers Thabisile Ximba (24) said she gave birth to a baby boy and she named him Lisakhanya. "I'm grateful for the gifts from the MEC," she said.
