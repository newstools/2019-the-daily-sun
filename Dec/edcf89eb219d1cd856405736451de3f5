MICASA member Dr Duda tied the knot over the weekend. The DJ and producer, whose real name is Sipho Mphahlaza, married publicist Karabo Maroga in a beautiful and romantic ceremony. Dr Duda was MiCasa’s last man standing as J’Something and Mo-T had already walked down the aisle. The musician and his wife hosted two weddings – one in Jane Furse in Limpopo on Saturday and the other in Tweefontein in Mpumalanga on Sunday. Bandmate and friend J’Something posted on Twitter yesterday to congratulate Dr Duda. He wrote: “Congratulations my brother. I’m super proud of you and honoured to have been a part of yours and Karabo’s special day! May your bond grow from strength to strength. “It’s been really special being your friend for nearly 10 years!” Singer Kabelo Mabalane also shared J’Something’s tweet and congratulated the producer. When contacted for comment, Dr Duda said he had to check if his wife was comfortable talking about their wedding. “I’m boarding a flight. Call me on Thursday and I’ll have to check with my wife first to check if she is comfortable,” he said.
