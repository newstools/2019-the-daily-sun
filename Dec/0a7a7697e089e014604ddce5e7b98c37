MAMELODI Sundowns coach, Pitso Mosimane, is starting to ponder the future without his key and veteran players, Hlompho Kekana and Denis Onyango. Mosimane seemed unhappy when admitting that no one would replace the two stalwarts. Onyango and Kekana have been superb soldiers in Mosimane’s success, not only in Mzansi, but also on the continent. Onyango (34), recognised three times in as many years as Africa’s best goalie, has been in and out of the side due to injuries. Kekana, also 34, is being managed. Mosimane has kept him from playing domestic games, so he’s always fresh for the Caf Champions League assignments. But his shooting ability has made him a cut above the rest. Said Mosimane: “It’s a big one. You can’t replace those ones, neh. It’s not easy. But I’m starting to think about it. “Sadly, you can’t replace them easily. Can you replace Lionel Messi? Can you replace Cristiano Ronaldo? Those guys are irreplaceable. “Can I replace the CBD (Leonardo Castro, Khama Billiat and Keagan Dolly)? It’s the way it is.” In Kekana’s case, Mosimane pins his hopes on Rivaldo Coetzee, who is injury-prone. The former Ajax Cape Town defender picked up an ankle injury in Sundowns’ league win over Stellenbosch FC midweek. His ankle is swollen and Mosimane said the Bafana international is yet to undergo an MRI scan to determine the severity of the injury. “Rivaldo is doing well. Andile Jali can pass the ball,” Mosimane said. “AJ is starting to pass the ball. Rivaldo can do the work for us.” With Onyango, Mosimane said there was no one to fill the player’s boots. “Onyango is an animal. Who can we get in the PSL? There’s no goalkeeper who can raise his hands.” The duo have won the Caf Champions League, Caf Super Cup titles and they have also won the Absa Premiership four times. Sundowns are now leading their group in the Caf Champions League. Winning the league last season saw Onyango and Kekana match Daine Klate’s record of six league titles.
