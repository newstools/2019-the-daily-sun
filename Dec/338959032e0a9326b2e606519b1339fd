LITTLE Mbali Mkhize was laid to rest yesterday. The six-year-old girl from block GG in Soshanguve, Tshwane, was allegedly killed by her mum’s friend a week ago. Her body was found in a river after she had been missing for two days. According to family spokesman Calvin Makgeru, the 60-year-old suspect confessed to killing Mbali and dumping her body in the river. He said the suspect was known to the family as a friend and not as the lover of Mbali’s mum, Noncebo (22). He said on the day Mbali went missing, the suspect took the child away without anyone noticing. “We began looking for her when we she didn’t come back home. When we asked him if he had seen her, he denied it until the community threatened him. “He then confessed to killing her and putting her body in a brown plastic and throwing it in a nearby river,” he said. Calvin said the family still didn’t know the motive behind the killing. “The kids in our yard know him as a family friend. That’s why it was easy for him to take the child,” he said. Gauteng policewoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said investigations suggested the child was targeted after a fight between the man and his girlfriend. “The mum was allegedly not home at the time of the child’s disappearance. The three lived together. Police were able to establish the suspect was behind the disappearance of the child. “A day after the child’s disappearance, the suspect pointed out to cops the exact spot where he allegedly dumped the body.” Peters said the suspect was an ex-convict who previously spent 25 years behind bars for the murder of his ex-wife and her lover. She said the suspect would appear in court on Friday.
