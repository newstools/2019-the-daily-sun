Two former Eskom executives, and two business directors, were granted R300 000 bail each after appearing in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday. They appeared alongside seven company executives on fraud, corruption and money laundering charges. They were arrested by the Hawks on fraud allegations at the Kusile Power Station in Balmoral, Mpumalanga, where R30 million was allegedly stolen from a project. France Hlakudi, who at the time was Eskom’s contracts manager for Kusile, as well as Abram Masango, who was the group executive for capital projects, were among those arrested. This was in relation to a R1,2 billion contract for work at Kusile. According to Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, the suspects were bust in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng by the Hawks and the NPA’s Investigative directorate. He said suspicions were raised over irregular dealings at Kusile and Medupi power stations. He said investigations revealed there was apparent gross manipulation of contractual agreements between contractors, Eskom employees and third parties at Kusile. He said a contract was approved in 2015 for R745 million to build two air-cooled condensers at the power station. “It’s alleged the appointed companies, other related entities and individuals shared approximately R30 million among themselves.” The power utility said the Eskom board and management were continuing to work with law enforcement agencies to root out corruption. “The arrests of two former Eskom senior managers, two business directors and seven companies are a culmination of investigations that were under way for some time. “Eskom observes the legal principle of presumption of innocence but will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that perpetrators of corruption are brought to book,” said the utility.
