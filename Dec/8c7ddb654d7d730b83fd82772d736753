EVERY December, thousands of people flock toDURBAN BEACHES and this year is no different. On Monday,  beachgoers enjoyed the clear skies and sunny weather on the North Beach. Nolubabalo Mvula (47) from Bizana, Eastern Cape, said she visited Durban to spend time with her family over the long weekend. “We have our own beach in the Eastern Cape but everyone knows Durban-beach weather never disappoints. It always has that welcoming effect that makes even us from outside KZN feel at home,” she said. Thabang Letsotsa (33) from Tshwane, Gauteng, said he came to the beach with friends. “We came as a group of six friends, two of whom are originally from KZN. “We once came here when there was a ceremony at one of our friend’s homes. “We enjoyed it so much that we now save money for this trip every December.” Thabang said they were going to be around until Christmas. “There after we will head back home in Tshwane because we want to cross over to 2020 with our families.” Thabang’s friend, Mhlo Dube (34) from U Section in Umlazi, said: “When I took them out to the beach and other areas such as kasi shisanyamas in 2014, I was just doing it to show them what we have in Durban. “It turns out they like it because they keep coming back every year to chill.”
