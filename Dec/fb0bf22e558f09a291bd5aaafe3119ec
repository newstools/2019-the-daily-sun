Cape Town Fire and Rescue spokesman Jermaine Carelse said: “At 2.20am, we responded to train carriages alight at Cape Town Railway Station. “The first arriving crews confirmed train carriages alight on platforms nine and 10. Upon further investigation, fires were found on platforms 12, 13 and 15.” Commuters told the SunTeam getting to work and home was a nightmare this week. Nthuthuzelo Gijima (44) from Kraaifontein said she used a train only twice this week. “We were told the tracks had been vandalised and now there is a fire.
