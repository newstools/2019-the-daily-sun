WHEN Phumzile Motha (33) got labour pains, her boyfriend Themba Maseko asked a neighbour for transport to Chiawelo Clinic, but she gave birth on the way. Themba (38) from Phiri, Soweto, told Daily Sun he asked for help from nurses in the labour ward, but they told him to wait as they were busy. “We waited a while before I went to check if they were coming, but I got the same response. They said men are not allowed in the ward.” Themba asked his aunt to go in, but she was told to wait.  “A nurse came with attitude telling us to grab a wheelchair and give it to Phumzile. We were afraid as they were still attached to each other. Yelling, she cut the cord and took them in.” Themba said when he called to check the next day, Phumzile had been moved to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. “She was bleeding a lot because nurses stitched her without cleaning her.”  Phumzile, who’s still in hospital, said: “I’m traumatised and don’t want to say much.” Joburg Health District’s Sandile Gwayi said nurses who were on duty denied being rude.“The case will be investigated once they file their reports.”
