A FAMILY from Phola, Mpumalanga, blame the Emalahleni Municipality after their house was flooded on Sunday night. Claudia Manana (25) told Daily Sun they had been reporting a blocked drain for several days but were never assisted. “We called the municipality to report the blocked drain and they never came to assist us,” said Claudia. “Rain water wouldn’t flow properly and caused flooding everywhere.” Claudia said everything was wet and they didn’t know what to do. She said if municipal officials had reacted on time, the situation could have been avoided. “It’s clear they don’t take residents seriously,” she said. Neighbours have accommodated Claudia and her family. “The only people assisting us are our neighbours,” she told the People’s Paper. “No councillor or government official have come to us.” Municipal spokesman Lebogang Mofokeng said in the past week there had been heavy rain in and around Emalahleni. Mofokeng said the municipality’s disaster management department would attend to the call. “We also want to alert the public to stay calm during this time,” said Mofokeng.
