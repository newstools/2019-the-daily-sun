A Themba Zwane dive that fooled referee Kulasande Qongqo into awarding a penalty assisted Mamelodi Sundowns in a 3-1 win over Stellenbosch in an Absa Premiership clash at Loftus Versfeld on Wednesday. Stellenbosch were the better side for the first 30 minutes and took the lead in the 35th minute with a Ryan Moon header to stun the Absa Premiership champions. After the break, the game swung in Sundowns' favour in the 57th minute as Themba Zwane blatantly dived inside the area with Qongqo pointing to the spot. Despite there being clear daylight between the Sundowns attacker and the attempted challenge by Stellenbosch captain Mogamad de Goede the penalty stood as Zwane stepped up to equalise. A clearly frustrated De Goede - caused by the earlier unjust decision - then received a straight red card for an ugly studs-up challenge on Rivaldo Coetzee. Two late goals by academy graduates Sphelele Mkhulise in the 85th minute and Keletso Makgwala in stoppage time sealed the three points for Pitso Mosimane's side. Speaking after the game, Mosimane - who had constantly criticised Kaizer Chiefs for their apparent beneficial treatment from referees - said that he was happy to benefit from the penalty decision. "If we benefited, why not?" retorted Mosimane.Â "It's about time. I even shrug my shoulder. I even want an offside on Saturday (TKO) and I will lift the trophy gladly. No problem."It's the way it is at this point in time. Even a penalty I'll take it. You can minus one goal and make it 2-1. It's up to you."
