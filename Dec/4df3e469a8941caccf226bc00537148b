BERNARD Molekwa has admitted that pressure is now mounting at Polokwane City. The last time the Limpopo side won an Absa Premiership league match was in September, when they beat SuperSport United 3-1 under former coach Zlatko Krmpotic. From there onwards it has been a downward spiral with Rise and Shine suffering seven consecutive league defeats. City are now linked with the former coach of Tanzanian side, Simba SC, Patrick Aussems, who was fired on Monday. Molekwa has been the go-to-guy for City boss Johnny Mogaladi who calls on him to take charge on an interim basis every time they lose a coach, and the faithful Molekwa is now seeing flames. “In football it’s all about results,” Molekwa said. “Pressure always mounts if results are not forthcoming. It is a fact, we are all under pressure. We are not going to give up or start panicking. We have a quality team capable of turning things around in our next two matches.” City host Telkom Knockout finalists, Maritzburg United at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday and end the year away to champions Mamelodi Sundowns on 21 December. Added Molekwa: “We are confident that we will go to Christmas break with positive results. It’s not going to be easy as all PSL matches are tough. But we have to move away from the position we are in.” City are in 13th spot with 13 points from 13 matches. They are only two points ahead of bottom side Chippa United.
