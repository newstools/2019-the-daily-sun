ARE YOU worried that you will be gaining more weight this
festive season? WELL researchers say coffee may do the trick when it
comes to staying slim. Findings from a new study suggest that drinking four cups
of coffee a day could reduce weight gain from a diet high in fat and sugar. Scientists at the University of Illinois found that rats
that consumed caffeine gained 16 percent less weight and accumulated 22 percent
less fat than those with no caffeine intake. The results don't mean you should skip eating a healthy
diet or overdo it on the caffeine. Experts say it's
still important to maintain a balanced diet. The experiment discovered that caffeine stopped the body
from producing as much fat in the blood and meant fat cells stored less inside
them than normal. The rats consumed the equivalent caffeine of four cups of
coffee and ate a carbohydrate-heavy diet high in fat and sugar for four weeks. They gained 16 per cent less weight than rats in a
non-caffeine group and built up 22 per cent less body fat. Scientists said this could be because the effects of
caffeine reduce action in a gene which is known to contribute to weight gain.
