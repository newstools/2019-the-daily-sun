THE Amapiano song Labantwana AmaUber has the whole of Mzansi on their feet dancing. But member of parliament Jacob Mamabolo said the song should be banned. A video of Mamabolo talking about the infamous song trended on social media two weeks ago. 'ACTOR STOLE MY PHONE!' In the video, Mamabolo was delivering a speech and was heard saying: “This will make sure that our kids don’t dance to songs such as abantwana ba rongo abantwana be Uber, bayifaka emakhaleni, bayayithatha, bayayi user.” When Daily Sun asked Mamabolo about his comments, he said he was delivering a speech on combating drugs in schools. He said: “Parents give these kids too much money for lunch to buy kota. But they misuse the rest of the money to buy drugs, get intoxicated and attack each other or teachers. “We must add social values in curriculums in schools so they learn values, ethics, morals and stay away from such songs.” BYE-BYE SEX MACHINE BEN 10! Mamabolo said he wanted a meeting with the producer of the song, Semi Tee, so he could explain the song to him. “I was told people really like the song and it’s an anti-drug song, but I’m still not convinced,” he said. But Semi Tee, real name Tumelo Ramaila, said the song stood for something good and shouldn’t be banned. “The first part of the song actually says young people must wake up, see the light and stop doing wrong things. PITCH BLACK AFRO REMAINS BEHIND BARS! “But unfortunately, people don’t know that part. “I realised that a lot of people don’t understand the song, but it’s actually the opposite of what Mr Mamabolo thinks.” He said he was open to meeting with Mamabolo and explaining the song in detail.
