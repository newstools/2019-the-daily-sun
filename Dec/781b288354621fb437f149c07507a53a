THIS four-day youth camp allows the youth to go back home fully equipped with knowledge and able to tackle challenges. One hundred and thirteen youth clubs from six provinces meet at the annual camp organised by the Southern African Association of Youth Clubs. This year’s camp, which began on Monday and ends tomorrow, is being held at Sweetdale in Margate, on the KZN South Coast. Various clubs learn about leadership, understanding communities and related issues. Outdoors, they do practical activities challenging them on how they should work with each other and teach them leadership skills. Programme manager Lebogang Mogopisi said: “The camp comes as a build-up from the training we offered the clubs over the year. “We empower members who’re given different tasks and so are able to qualify for the camp.” Revolution South Productions founder Simphiwe Ramuko from North West said his club hosts events and trains local artists. He attended the camp because he saw it as an exciting event because of the topics. “This is a great chance to network with youth from other provinces.” Precious Madonsela (23) from Sesifikile Youth Development Centre in Mpumalanga said she enjoyed it very much. Their organisation provided computer skills and career development for the youth. “It’s amazing to be with other young people from different provinces who do what you do. “This gives us a platform to share ideas and learn from others,” she said. Precious said her highlight while at the camp was when they were taught to face their fears and take decisions.
