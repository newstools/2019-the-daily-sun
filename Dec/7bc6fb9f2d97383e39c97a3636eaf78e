A TAXI shooting left one person dead and two injured yesterday morning. The injured are members of the Alex Taxi Association. The incident happened near Plaza Taxi Rank in Olievenhoutbosch, south of Tshwane. ER24 emergency service spokesman Russel Meiring told Daily Sun:“One person was declared dead on the scene. The injured men were treated on the scene before they were transported to a nearby hospital.”  Olievenhoutbosch has had a spate of violent attacks over the past two weeks. On Thursday, two passengers were rushed to hospital after they were shot and wounded in the area. Residents shared their experiences of the violence in the area. Sabelo Ngoma (33) told Daily Sun it’s time police gave this matter serious attention. Tshidi Mokoena (44) said: “Passengers now risk losing their lives when they board taxis.”  Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said cases of murder and attempted murder were opened and police were looking for the suspects. Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo threatened to shut down all the affected routes. “I’ve convened an urgent meeting with taxi associations operating in Olievenhoutbosch because we want to end the violence,” he said. Mamabolo said a commission of inquiry was set up to investigate taxi wars in Gauteng.  The association couldn’t be reached for comment at the time of going to print.
