THE Health MEC will get her hands dirty and lend a helping hand in the province’s busy hospitals. This is part of a new initiative called Lul’isandla (lend a hand) aimed at improving service delivery at hospitals and ensuring daily operations go well. Every month, MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu and her senior management team including at least five doctors, nurses as well as finance, legal, computer science and human resource experts will spend a day at the hospitals. READ: HEALTH WORKERS DOWN TOOLS Simelane-Zulu made her first visit at Addington Hospital in Durban on Tuesday, where she gave the department’s key decision-makers a first-hand account of the realities faced by the public and staff at public healthcare facilities. “Our goal is to ensure the challenges we find are solved when we leave. For instance, when we arrived at Addington, we were told about challenges in IT that relate to functionality of the computers,” she said. “We came up with short and long-term solutions. That is what we want to achieve. These visits don’t necessarily have to be walkabouts, but are for us to get to the hospital and assist because there are a number of challenges there.” She said Addington was chosen due to increased foot traffic caused by festive season activity. Resident Noluthando Xulu (45) said such visits would keep lazy nurses on their feet. “The MEC must also go to KwaMashu and other kasi clinics because that is where nurses tend to do as they please.”
