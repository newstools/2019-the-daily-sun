Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Andile Jali has been included in the CAF Champions League Team of the Week for his fine display against Wydad Casablanca. Jali found himself on the fringes of the first-team squad last season and at the beginning of the current one. Indeed, the former Orlando Pirates playmaker made just 15 appearances for the Brazilians last season since returning from a four-year stint in Belgium. But in recent times, the 29-year-old has firmly re-established himself as the premier central midfielder in South African football. He looks fitter, leaner and hungrier and his performance in the 0-0 draw with Wydad in Casablanca on Saturday earned him the man-of-the-match award and a place alongside Africa's finest in the team of the week. Jali is the only South African in the team and has been selected in a three-man midfield alongside Al Ahly duo Amr El Solia and Mohammed Magdy Afsha. The defence is made up of Wael Gomaa (Ah Ahly), Abdel Kader Bedrane (Esparance de Tunis), Abdllatif Noussir (Wydad Casablanca), Sanad Al-Warfali (Al Ahli Tripoli) and goalkeeper Achraf Krir (Etoile de Sahel). Other players included in the team are strikers Karimi Aribi (Etoile de Sahel), Anice Badri (Esperance de Tunis) and Achraf Bencharki (Zamelek). The Brazilians, who are at the summit of Group C with four points after two games, will next travel to Algeria for their next match against USM Alger on December 27. SOURCE:Â SPORT24
