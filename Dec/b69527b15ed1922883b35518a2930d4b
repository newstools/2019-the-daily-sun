A VIDEO of a woman who was allegedly caught cheating went viral on social media. In the video, the woman’s husband walks into a backroom and shows how messy it is. He then asks where his wife Yolanda is before finding her under the bed. But she just lies there not saying anything to the husband. According to Twitter users, hiding under the bed was not ideal place to hide when you cheat. Twitter users shared some of the places they’ve hidden when they were caught cheating. “You people think this Yolanda drama scares us on taking pride for being Xhosa, think again. We’ve been bad-mouthed from the onset, so this is a minor glitch. Siyabuya futhi next year. She’s our person and we’re proud,” she said.
