FORMER Orlando Pirates defender Edward “Magents” Motale believes the club should be wary of bringing Milutin “Micho” Sredojevic back into the fold. Micho left the Buccaneers at the start of the current campaign after being approached by Egyptian side Zamalek, but he has since lost his job at the Cairo-based outfit leading some to suggest that Pirates should get him back. Motale, however, doesn’t want Pirates to act too rashly in hiring Micho back since he did not leave the Soweto side in the best manner. “He got what he felt was a good offer for him and he decided to leave Orlando Pirates and I don’t think he has any regrets about leaving,” Motale told Goal. “He felt that he had to leave. Having said that it would be an unwise decision for Pirates to bring him back looking at how he left the club.” Motale added: “We were told that he called the management and informed them of his decision to resign all of sudden. Then he vanished. “However, if there was an agreement between him and Pirates that he would come back to the club if things don’t work out at Zamalek, then I don’t have a problem with that. “I’m saying this because he laid a good foundation at Pirates before he left. You could see that the team was destined to win trophies under his guidance.” – SPORT24
