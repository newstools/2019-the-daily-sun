Despite being aggrieved by President Cyril Ramaphosa's administration and accusing him of selling the country to the highest bidder, the EFF is not considering a motion of no confidence against him. Instead party leader commander in chief Julius Malema says they would rather channel their energies in mobilizing forces on the left to defend the country from being auctioned. Malema told Journalists at a press conference on the sidelines of the 2nd National People's Assembly it would not be good for the country to table the motion in these early days. "There is not motion of confidence against the president we are going to pass. Motions of confidence are the last resort," he assured. He said it can not be that every time they disagree with a sitting president they take the motion of confidence route. Malema said the task at hand was for the left forces to mobilize and take to the streets in defence of state owned entities which he said Ramaphosa wants to sell to the white monopoly capital and his cabal. "The first action must be directed at Eskom. No one is going to sell Eskom under our watch. We are not going to allow that. "So we invite everyone who is on the side of the working class to the picket lines. "If the forces on the left are not going to be on the picket lines then the right wings will do what is in their interests because the left is inactive," Malema warned. He said he was glad that AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa honored the invitation and addressed the assembly and spoke about putting egos aside. He added that Saftu secretary general Zwelinzima Vavi sang the same tune and they have also communicated the same message. "Can you imagine the March of EFF, AMCU, Saftu and Numsa? We can shake this country. "So 2020 is going to be a year of action, the left forces united in the picket lines," he promised.
