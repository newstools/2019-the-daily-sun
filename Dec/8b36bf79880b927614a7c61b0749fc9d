YOUNG Romans Sports Club in Gugulethu, Cape Town, wants parents to take care of their kids, especially during the festive season. The club’s Wandisile Ngeyi (50) said they kept kids busy and taught them how to behave. “A lot of bad things happen during this time, especially to the youth,” he said. “Some of them get involved in drugs and crime, while others get pregnant.” The club organises soccer and netball games and teaches boys how to treat girls. “Men abuse women because they were never told at an early age how to treat women,” said Wandisile. “We want them to know their job is to always protect women and not to lay a hand on them.” Parent Nandipha Mxobo (35) said the club would make a lot of changes in the community. “Our kids get involved in all the bad things because of the free time they have.” Unathi Phama (12) said the club opened at the right time. “We love soccer and want the club to help us become better players,” he said. Inam Mbangeni (13) said most other teens liked to booze during this time. “I’m happy I won’t be one of them because of this club and I know that we’re safe here.”
