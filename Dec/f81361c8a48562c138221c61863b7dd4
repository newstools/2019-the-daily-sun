AMAZULU coach Jozef Vukusic has made it clear that defender Tsepo Gumede must leave his club. The Usuthu boss says Gumede is not part of his plans for the future. Both parties are currently working on a way to part ways amicably, as the former Orlando Pirates defender has fallen out of favour. In fact, since Vukusic took over the reins at AmaZulu in September, Gumede has since been overlooked. The Dobsonville-born defender who joined Usuthu on a short term contract midway through last season before the Durban club exercised the two year option in his contract, has played only once under Vukusic. “Gumede is not in our plans,” Vukusic said without any hesitation after his side drew 0-0 with Maritzburg United in their Absa Premiership clash at King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday. “That is the simple answer, and he knows it too.” It became evident that Gumede’s future with Usuthu is doomed after the former Polokwane City coach signed former Kaizer Chiefs defender Mario Booysen. The former Ajax Cape Town and Maritzburg United defender has been the preferred player since he joined the side. Gumede was already a free agent for six months when Usuthu signed him last season after being released by Cape Town City at the end of the 2017-18 season. This pending departure will come as a huge blow in Gumede’s career after getting an unexpected Bafana Bafana call up in 2015 for the 2017 Afcon qualifiers. The only match that he has played for AmaZulu was against SuperSport United at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on 18 September.
