ONE suspect who could be linked to the murder of a teenage boy was bust yesterday. Minenhle Mbonambi (15) was gunned down at his home earlier this month. Apparently, cops received a tip-off that the suspect was hiding in Umlazi Hostel in Durban. READ: KICKED OFF STAGE BY FANS Family spokesman Sibusiso Mbonambi (39) from Dendethu Village in Sundumbili, KZN, said they were glad the suspect was bust. “We don’t want him to get bail. “He should be kept in jail until he reveals the other suspects he was with,” said Sibusiso. As if that was not enough pain for the family, Sibusiso said his brother’s son was also gunned down on Saturday. “My nephew Busizwe (27) was gunned down at home. I believe this suspect is also linked to Minenhle’s death.” He said Busizwe was asleep when the suspects fired six shots at him and he died at the scene. “My brother and I have many taxis in the area. So we suspect that our sons are being killed because of our taxis. This looks like jealous people want us to feel pain,” he said. “Our sons don’t even drive our cars. Minenhle was still at school, while Busizwe was training at the municipality and had never been involved in taxis.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed a 27-year-old man was fatally shot at his home by two men.
