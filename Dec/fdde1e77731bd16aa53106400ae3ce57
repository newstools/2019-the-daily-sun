THE Competition Commission has released a report stating that Mzansi data prices are high. The commission says through benchmarking and profitability analysis they’ve confirmed that data prices are high. Addressing the media on Monday, the commission said existing international comparisons on mobile prepaid data prices collectively indicate that South Africa currently performs poorly relative to other countries, with prices generally on the more expensive end. Vodacom and MTN argued that such comparisons are vague because cost and quality differences across countries, including spectrum allocations, may account for the differences in pricing. “They have also argued that such comparisons involve headline 30-day tariffs and that effective prices, including promotions, short-validity bundles and free data, are a better basis for comparison,” The commission said. However, despite having detailed cost, quality and effective price information across the different African markets in which they currently operate, the operators have failed to make use of this information to demonstrate that cost and quality factors do account for the price differentials or that South African effective prices are in line with other markets. “The failure to do so leads to the obvious conclusion that the results are unhelpful to their case and therefore one can deduce that these factors do not account for the price differentials observed and that South Africa still performs poorly when assessed on effective prices,” the Competition Commission said.
