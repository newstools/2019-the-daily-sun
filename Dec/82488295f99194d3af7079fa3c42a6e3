MUZI Mfuza (42) and his wife Maria Makoe (39) worked hard to save for Christmas clothes for their kids. But their house in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, was ransacked on Saturday and their boys’ clothes stolen. “We suspect they used muthi to make us sleep,” said Maria. ZUMA BACK IN MZANSI They noticed something which looked like muthi had been burnt on the stove. The kitchen window was closed even though it was open when she prepared food that morning. Muzi said: “I don’t know how we’re going to get the money after spending R1 500 on the boys’ clothes.” He said the thugs stole his plasma TV, which was mounted on the wall, and two cellphones. “We know the people who stole our things but they’re still walking the streets. I work part time as a taximanyet people steal from us.” Maria didn’t know how to explain to her kids their clothes had been stolen. “They’ve seen the clothes and won’t understand.” Muzi said Tsakane police only opened a case after they complained. “We fear this case might be swept under the carpet.” Sergeant Lerato Mngomezulu advised Muzi to notify the investigating officer about the new information he has. “We’re investigating and no arrests have been made yet,” she said.
