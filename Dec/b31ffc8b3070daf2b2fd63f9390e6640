DUMI is tired of his girlfriend of two years but he’s probably stuck with her for good. That’s because her mum, who’s a sangoma, gave him a terrible choice. “She told me I must stay or go, but if I go I’ll go mad,” claimed Dumi Mkhonza (36). He’s a businessman from Freedom Park, south of Joburg. He told Daily Sun he met his lover in December 2017, and after three months she introduced him to her sangoma mum (65) year old sangoma from Sebokeng, Vaal. But Dumi said a few months later he got headaches and he thought he was going crazy. “My girlfriend took me to her mum and I was cured within a day. She told me she was behind the headaches and if I ever left her daughter, I’d go mad.” Now Dumi wants to leave his partner, but he’s afraid of going crazy. “Sangomas have told me only my mamazala could unlock what she has done,” he said. “We stay together but when I tell her to clean, she becomes stubborn and aggressive.” Dumi said he spoke to her mum but she reminded him that he couldn’t leave. His lover told Daily Sun Dumi couldn’t leave her. “And he knows that. I’m not a slave to clean and cook for him. He must hire someone for that,” she said. His partner said three men left her daughter and she didn’t like seeing her upset. “When she introduced this good-looking and wealthy man, I gave him muthi so he’d stay forever. I knew one day he’d want to vanish.” She said Dumi helps them a lot. “He’d make a good son-in-law one day.” Dumi confirmed he bought them groceries and gave them money sometimes. “But that doesn’t mean I must stay forever,” he said. Sangoma Jabulani Mthimunye told Daily Sun the person who put the lock holds the key to the curse.
