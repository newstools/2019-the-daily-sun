his car keys from the person taking the video. It
is not clear how his car keys ended up in the hands of the person taking the
video. The
man asks the drunk cop if he think it’s okay for him to drive as he was and who
cop jacket belongs to?. And
he responds “Voetsek and keep on demanding his car keys back. The
41 seconds long video ends with another man appearing and removing the police
jacket from the man. Free State police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said
the jacket belong to the police. Mbambo
told Daily Sun: "It's difficult to confirm especially since he's not on
duty and wearing private, except for that top with a police batch. He's
obviously not on duty so I can't confirm if anything will be investigated until
somebody confirms that he's a police officer and was transgressing at the time.
But we will follow up to check if he's a police officer and will need the
person who was taking the video to come forward and lay a charge or
report."
