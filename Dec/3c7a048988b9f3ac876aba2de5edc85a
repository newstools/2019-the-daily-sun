Unemployed SIBONELO Hadebe found a way to make an honest living. The 38-year-old from Klaarwater in Durban went to the beach to make sand drawings. Sibonelo said he’d been enjoying his work since he started this business in 2010 and hoped it would be acknowledged worldwide. “I passed my matric in 2007. I searched for a job with no luck. In my area, most people my age ended up getting involved in crime because of unemployment,” he said. Sibonelo said he got interested in sand drawings after seeing people making them in 2010. “I decided to join them because I knew how to draw but had never done it on sand,” he said. Sibonelo said as time went on he got used to it and mastered it. “Now, I really enjoy it and people love my work,” he said. He charges people R50 to write their names on a drawing and take a photo next to it. “But when they just want to have a look at my work, they give me any donation. It can be anything from R50 to R100.” He said he made more money during holiday seasons than during the year. “That’s when most people come to the beach,” he said. He said he made about R500 a day in the middle of the year and between R800 and R1 000 during holiday periods. Sibonelo said rainy days hit him hard in the pocket as the sand was wet and no one visited the beach. He said he didn’t have kids yet, but with the money he made he was able to support his family. “I live with my father and three sisters, who are all unemployed. “We’re able to buy things we need around the house with the money I make,” he said.
