THE refugees blame the City of Cape Town for being forced to find other places to relieve themselves. They said the city prevented them from using public toilets close to the church where they currently live. Group leader JP Balus said: “The city instructed their workers not to allow refugees to use public toilets. “They even instructed neighbours around us not to give refugees water or anything. How do you think the refugees will live? They have to find ways to relieve themselves,” said Balus. He said they were blamed for the condition of Green Market Square, but he said it was full of kak and urine before they got there. “This place smelled of urine when we got here. Homeless people slept here when we arrived and they’re still sleeping here. They can’t say it was refugees who made this place smell bad. It’s not true.” MMC for community services and health Zahid Badroodien said public toilets operated during business hours. He said when refugees first occupied the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ offices, they opened the toilets 24 hours, but the municipality went back to its normal working hours after they moved to a nearby church. “Public toilets can’t be left open 24 hours a day as this increases the risk of vandalism and could attract anti-social behaviour.”
