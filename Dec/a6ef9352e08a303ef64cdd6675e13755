Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “At about 11am, a woman in a Toyota Avanza was travelling between Addo and Paterson. “On her way back to Paterson, she was pulled over by five armed men in a white Toyota Corolla and they robbed her of R200 600.” In another incident, a 56-year-old woman from Mandela Village was robbed of R14 500 by three men at about 11.45am, just after she had withdrawn money at Kenako Mall.

Just after they parked their vehicle at Motherwell NU 4 B, five armed men arrived and robbed them of R187 000.” Beetge said so far, more than R400 000 stokvel money has been robbed in Nelson Mandela Bay. “We have on several occasions warned organisers and investors in stokvels and savings clubs not to move around with large sums of money and to rather make use of electronic banking solutions to distribute and share the money. “In the past two weeks, there were eight stokvel robberies totalling just under R430 000 in the Motherwell Cluster alone. This means investors that lost R430 000 due to the negligence of their stokvel investment organisers,” he said.
