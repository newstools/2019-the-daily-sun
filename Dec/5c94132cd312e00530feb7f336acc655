A SEPTUAGENARIAN musician is grateful to people who prayed for her after she suffered a heart attack following a performance in France last month. Latozi Mpahleni, who plays uhadi (bowstring) and the umrhube (mouthbow), and fellow musician Pedro Espi-Sanchis were forced to cut short their tour after the 76-year-old gogo collapsed in the toilets on 15 November.

I thought I was going to die. But then people who didn’t even know me prayed for me. I’m grateful for what they did,” she told Daily Sun. The pair arrived in France on 13 November for two shows. They were expected to return home on 17 November after their second performance. But they came back earlier than scheduled because of the heart attack. “We performed at Grimaud in Southern France but then I got ill,” she said. “My voice is gone. I only drink homemade amahewu and eat umleqwa. I don’t know what the problem is,” she said. Espi-Sanchis, who plays ixilongo, said one of gogo’s heart valves was not functioning properly. “She needs a heart valve replacement at the best possible hospital. We’re hoping for any organisation, including the department of arts and culture, to help with the surgery so music lovers can continue to enjoy her music,” he said.

I’ve been working with her since in 1984,” he said. Mpahleni said her mum taught her to play the instruments. “I never went to school but I travel to the same places that educated people visit,” she said.
