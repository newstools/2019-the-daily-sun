PHUMLANI Duma, chairman of Sadtu in KZN, has lashed out at teachers who date their pupils. Speaking at Sadtu’s provincial meeting in Durban on Tuesday, Duma said the union was concerned that there were still cases in KZN of teachers having sexual relationships with pupils. He warned that his union would not tolerate members having affairs with pupils. He said Sadtu members must remember they were not only teachers but also guardians. “Comrades, parents have entrusted us with a big responsibility, looking after their kids while they are at work. “We need to take this responsibility seriously and honour it. When someone asks you to look after his or her kids, you must know that that person trusts you,” said Duma. He also warned Sadtu leaders not to fight for positions, but to give others a chance to apply for them. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu announced there would be no bonuses for officials if this year’s matric pass rate dropped. He said this year’s provincial target was 80%. “Bonuses for officials will only be paid if the province does well,” he said.
