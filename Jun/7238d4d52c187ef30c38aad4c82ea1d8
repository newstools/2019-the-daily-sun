 The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) says it is deeply
concerned that municipalities are not improving their audit outcomes. This follows Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu's release of the
municipal audit report for the 2017/18 period. Makwetu, who is responsible for auditing government books,
raised concerns about irregular expenditure in local government, flagging that
it remained high, although lower than 2016/17 and previous years. The spending
decreased from R29.7bn to R25bn. SAHRC spokesperson Gushwell Brooks said the commission had
written a letter seeking an audience with Minister of Cooperative Governance
and Traditional Affairs Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and would in that meeting share
its concerns regarding the state of municipalities among other interests it had
on the state of the sphere of local government. "The report by the Auditor-General is startling as it
paints an overall picture which highlights that the performance of
municipalities is progressively deteriorating at an alarming rate in key
metrics with regard to past performances in this sphere of government,"
Brooks added. The commission said it was unacceptable that billions were
still irregularly spent when millions of people in the country continued living
in impoverished and deplorable conditions without adequate access to the most
basic social services. "Twenty-five years into our constitutional democracy,
it is regrettable and totally unacceptable that such wastage of precious
resources is still rampant in our municipalities." Brooks said the SAHRC would be robustly engaging with
relevant stakeholders, including the South African Local Government
Association, to ensure there was improved delivery of essential services in all
communities across nine provinces. SOURCE: NEWS24
