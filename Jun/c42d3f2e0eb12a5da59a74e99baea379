WHEN the Limpopo initiation season was launched earlier this month, promises were made that no one under the age of 12 would be initiated. But an eight-year-old boy is among three initiates who have died in Limpopo since the season began. Chief Malesela Dikgale, chairman of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders, said they were concerned about the deaths recorded so far. He told Daily Sun the three boys died at three initiation schools in Sekhukhune, Mopani and Waterberg districts. “This is unacceptable. One of the schools ignored the legal age limit, which is 12 years. Another, in Sekhukhune, was operating illegally,” he said. He said action would be taken against all illegal schools and those that failed to obey the rules. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said three inquest dockets had been opened. “The deaths of the three initiates are still under police investigation. We are still going to conduct autopsies to determine what the cause of death was,” said Ngoepe.
