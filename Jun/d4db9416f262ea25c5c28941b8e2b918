THE mood was sombre as friends, family and the community came to say their final goodbyes to former councillor Amos Mampheko. He was buried on Saturday at Winterveld Cemetery in Tshwane. The 47-year-old from Winterveld, north of Tshwane, was shot dead after a meeting with the local ANC Youth League two weeks ago. Speakers at the service held at Winterveld community Hall said he was a selfless man. His brother Elias said: “The family and the community have lost a leader. “He was a caring person who made sure the needs of people were met. “He brought water and sanitation to this area. He brought change.” Elias said they wanted the killers to rot behind bars.Ward councillor Malebo Rasegwete said they had lost a soldier. “Let’s celebrate his life. We all know what he did. We must follow in his footsteps,” she said. Amos’ uncle Gilbert Pole said he had died before his time. “He was supposed to bury me, not the other way around,” he said. Gilbert said he hoped Amos’ killers will suffer.
