IT'S OFFICIAL! WE have beautiful people in Mzansi. Mzansi is has been voted one of the top sexy countries in the world. Our country ranked 6 out of 50 countries. The survey was conducted by bigseventravel.com. They surveyed a sample of our 1.5 million social audience to get an insight into where you’ll find the world’s most beautiful people. Look, some countries are sexier than others – at least, that’s what the results of our latest survey of the sexiest nationality in the world is proving. Survey respondents were given no further specifications of the term ‘sexy’, so interpretation of the word was up to them. ‘Sexy’, according to the fail-safe Merriam-Webster dictionary, is classified as “generally attractive or interesting”. While beauty may be only skin deep, it’s probably little consolation to the unlucky countries that have been voted as the least sexy in the world. Sorry, Below is a list of the top 10 nationalities in the world: 10. Canadian 9. English 8. Armenian 7. Italian 6. South African 5. Australian 4. Brazilian 3. Filipino 2. Danish 1. Ukrainian
