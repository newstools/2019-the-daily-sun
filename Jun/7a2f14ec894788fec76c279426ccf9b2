THE 59th anniversary of the Ingquza Hill massacre was commemorated yesterday. The massacre occurred on the Ngquza Hill, near Flagstaff, in Lusikisiki, Eastern Pondoland, on 6 June 1960. Men and women had gathered on the hill for a peaceful meeting after years of opposition to apartheid. Two military aircraft attacked the villagers, firing tear gas and smoke bombs. Armed police surrounded the crowd. Eleven people were killed and 58 were injured. A total of 23 villagers were arrested. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said the victims had a vision to protect the land of their forefathers. “Land should be given to the people. That will translate to dignity,” he said. “The province has plans for the reburial of five people who were hanged and buried in Pretoria. This should be done by the next commemoration date.” The premier also said he would look into the lucrative cannabis industry. “We’ll see how we can organise it to create a business that will create job opportunities,” he said.
