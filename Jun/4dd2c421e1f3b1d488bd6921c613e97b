THE City of Tshwane is planning a safe place for homeless people to live. This is after five homeless men were killed in Muckleneuk, allegedly by a serial killer, over the past three weeks. MMC for social development Sakkie du Plooy told Daily Sun: “We will provide facilities where the homeless can live until they find work. “We care for them and want to provide them with a place to sleep.” He said the municipality had one shelter for homeless people on Struben Street but people who are not supposed to be living there had to be removed. The shelter said they might have space in three months. Du Plooy said they had identified a place in the Pretoria CBD for a shelter but they were still talking to the owners to try to organise arrangements. Gauteng police spokeswoman Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said management expressed concern after a fifth body was found in Pretoria. The body was found last Tuesday at a bus terminal just 400 metres from Unisa’s main campus. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela instructed a high level task team to prioritise an investigation into the killings. Anyone with information should contact their nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
