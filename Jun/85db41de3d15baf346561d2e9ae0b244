The Durban
man who was accused of the rape and murder of 19-year-old sex worker Siam Lee
has died, his lawyer has said. "His
uncle told me that he passed away at 07:30 in the morning. He died of
cancer," his lawyer, Reial Mahabeer, said on Friday. Philani
Ntuli faced a string of charges related to Lee's murder and others relating to
his ex-fianc√©. He was
arrested after Lee's body was discovered in a sugarcane field in New Hanover,
KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, in January 2018. Siam Lee's
mother Carmen Nans Lee says she wasn't expecting to hear details of her child's
murder on Wednesday. He was
granted R40 000 bail while his trial continued in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court
in Durban. The State
opposed Ntuli's bail bid and argued that there was public outrage in the
matter. Previously,
during the bail application process, Magistrate Mohamed Motala criticised
police and the private investigators who arrested Ntuli. He said
they did not follow constitutional procedures during the arrest. SOURCE:
