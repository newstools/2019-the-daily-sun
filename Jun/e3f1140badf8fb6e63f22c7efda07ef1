SUSAN Matumba (40) from Madombidzha Village, outside Louis Trichardt, Limpopo owns and teaches at the Matambwaashu Performing Arts Academy. She said this is where she shares her knowledge. “For me, the performing arts is a good way of handling situations. It gives me the confidence to face any challenge. “Through the use of drama, I can play anyone, from a homeless person to a diva,” she said. She started her academy last year with an intake of only 12 students. “This number helps me bring out the talent and strength of each student. Our acting, writing, directing and dance courses are accredited with the Cathsseta skills authority.” “I am a critical thinker and my dream is for Limpopo to have its own arts and culture centre. Kids are educated through the arts, craft, literature and heritage festivals. They remind us where we come from,” she said. Susan has acted in radio dramas since she was 10. “I played alongside the late Tendani Mulaudzi, better known as Maswigiri. “I played his daughter in most dramas,” she said. Susan has also done some scriptwriting. The Wits University education graduate worked for the South African National Road Agency after her studies. She later taught English at high school for two years before going to China to teach English. The second intake at her academy will take place on 9 July, when children aged 6–16 are welcome to audition. “There will be also an open session for those aged 18 and older,” Susan said.
