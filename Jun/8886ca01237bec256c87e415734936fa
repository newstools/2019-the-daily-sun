IT WAS chaos at the International Convention Centre in Durban! Yesterday, groups demanded that government representatives sign a petition committing themselves to providing free sanitary pads for all. The organisations including people living with Aids, victims of abuse and others, blocked the entrance yesterday, saying they would leave only when they got attention. They said 30% of girls lost 50 days of school because they didn’t have pads. SA National Aids Council spokesman Steve Letsike said they were protesting over the high cost of pads. “We want them to be free because girls fall victim to sugar daddies as they want money to buy these basic needs. “We are saying pads should be distributed in the same way as condoms,” Letsike said. SA Positive Women Ambassadors spokeswoman Slungile Mntambo said they wanted the health, education and social development departments to provide free pads for all. Zukiswa Phiri of the department of health accepted the memorandum. She was told they were giving the department 14 days to respond.
