POLOKWANE City midfielder Edgar Manaka said he’s ready to settle down. The 29-year-old from Ga-Matlala, Limpopo, proposed to his partner and baby mama Kwanele Mabuza (28) on Monday on a plane. They were coming back from a holiday in the Western Cape, on their way to Joburg, when the pilot announced someone was going to propose. Speaking about his proposal, Edgar said: “I stood up, took out a ring and went down on my knee. “She became emotional because she didn’t expect it. “I was so happy when she said yes.” Edgar said he met Kwanele in Rustenburg, North West, while he was playing for Platinum Stars, and it was love at first sight. “We’ve been together for five years. I believe it’s time to settle down. I’m always travelling and changing clubs. I want to bring her along wherever I’m going,” he said. “I also wanted to set an example to my peers that it’s not difficult to settle down with one partner and be responsible. When I proposed, I didn’t think about myself but about my family as there’s now a child involved.” Edgar said the engagement was a huge step and showed how serious he was about her. “Any time from now, wedding bells will ring.” Kwanele said she didn’t expect the proposal but was happy. “I was surprised as I didn’t see it coming at all. I was overwhelmed with emotion and very happy. I love him. This is the first step in the right direction,” she said. #??mood A post shared by  Diala Edgar Manaka (@edgarstiga20) on Jun 3, 2019 at 8:57am PDT    #Incase u missed it... ??
