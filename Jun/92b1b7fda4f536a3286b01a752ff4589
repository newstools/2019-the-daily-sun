PRESIDENT Donald Trump has once again denied allegations he sexually assaulted a magazine advice columnist in the mid-1990s. “She’s not my type,” Trump said during an interview with The Hill, a political news outlet, in response to claims he raped E Jean Carroll in a New York department store dressing room. The allegations are contained in Carroll’s new book, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal. “I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?” Trump said, adding Carroll was “totally lying” when she made her claims. “I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her,” he said. Carroll’s account, revealed last week in an excerpt of her new book published by New York magazine, makes her at least the 16th woman to have accused Trump of sexual misconduct before he became president. The encounter allegedly took place at the Bergdorf Goodman store in Manhattan. – NEWS24
