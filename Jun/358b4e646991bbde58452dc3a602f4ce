FOR many years, taxi drivers have been called bad names like Bomageza, a loosely translation that in the early morning before they drive passengers to their destination, they just splash their faces on the tap water than taking a full bath. But this was put to a test when the SunTeam witnessed good taxi drivers and owners come together to pay their last respects to one of their queue marshalls, Sello Rampaku. Sello was laid to rest at the Simunye cemetery last Saturday. After the funeral, 20 members of the burial society, known as the Bekkersdal Taxi Burial Society, shared their story. “We’re proud that our member was buried in an expensive coffin,” said the founder of the society, Speech Mahuma. “The formation of our society was the brainchild of local political activist, Wonder Modise, who always helps the community.” The society, which was formed in 2000, includes taxi drivers, owners, teachers and unemployed members from Simunye, Bekkersdal and Westonaria, on the West Rand. Each member contributes R400 a month and the group meets every first week of the month. “When a principal member dies we make sure to bury them in a casket. “Dependants are buried in a dome. But Scalo, as Sello was nicknamed, was no ordinary member,” said chairman Mzamo Mandaba. “He was a disciplined and active member who earned himself the name ‘discipline executive chairperson’. “We work in partnership with the Diale Funeral Parlour from Mohlakeng. The bereaved family gets a R5 000 payout.” Moses Majola said: “We always preach unity and love among ourselves. Imagine if death strikes twice in a month? “We need to assure our members that their backs are covered.”
