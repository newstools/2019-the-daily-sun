EVERYWHERE he goes he gets stopped by curious onlookers. This is not only because he is the premier of the Northern Cape, but also because people think he is international musician Seal, of the Kiss From a Rose fame. Dr Zamani Saul said this had happened to him more times than he can count in Mzansi and abroad. On Friday he posted his photo on his Twitter account alongside that of Seal and asked: “Is there a resemblance here?” “Just today a white boy called his mom to come and meet Seal.” The post received many likes with a lot of people saying the two did indeed look alike. Sakhile Njoko said: “The resemblance suggests you got a kiss from a rose too. Now I want to see this magic rose.” Taps Liphoko replied: “I initially thought you were Seal. In fact you are Seal and Seal is you. Case closed.” CK Zwide said: “Case sealed.”
