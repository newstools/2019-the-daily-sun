RESIDENTS from Ramaphosa squatter camp have been stealing electricity from RDP houses in the area. They connected their own cables to a transformer, leading to an explosion which angered the RDP residents of the squatter camp in Reiger Park, Ekurhuleni. And on Tuesday, the gatvol RDP residents went wild. Armed with guns, they went around the area to cut all the illegal cables on all the transformers and burn some of them. But squatters put up a fight and reconnected their cables, which residents then cut off again. RDP house owners said they wanted to teach the squatters a lesson and to stop them stealing their electricity. Bullets flew as the residents and squatters exchanged fire. Reiger Park police had their hands full trying to stop the two groups from fighting. “We are running businesses and when they take our izinyoka cables our children are going to starve,” said one of the squatters. “We have been promised electricity by municipal officials because they wanted our votes, but now they have turned their backs on us.” RDP residents said they were gatvol as they paid for electricity. “We’re forced to stay in the dark and yet we buy electricity. This is unfair. “These squatters want everything for free. We’d rather fight than allow them to take our electricity,” said a resident. Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said illegal connections cost the municipality a lot of money. He said technicians were sent to remove them most of the time, but the culprits put them back as soon after they left.
