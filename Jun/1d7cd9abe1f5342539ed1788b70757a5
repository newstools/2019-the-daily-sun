ANGRY Vlakfontein residents have accused the justice system of being corrupt. This was after Fita Khupe (61), one of the men accused of killing seven Khoza family members, was freed by the Lenasia Magistrates Court on Friday due to lack of evidence. In October, seven bodies were found buried in the house. Khupe was bust with Ernest Mabaso, who committed suicide in custody. They were charged with murder and rape. When residents heard that the Khupe case was withdrawn, they barricaded parts of the Golden Highway with burning tyres, before protesting outside the Khoza house. They said they didn’t want Khupe to come back to the area. Rebecca Maloi, a ward 22 secretary, said: “There’s no such thing as lack of evidence. The system is corrupt and we demand answers!” NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonodwane said there was no evidence linking Khupe to the murder. She said they met family members to explain the motivation for the decision. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said no arrests were made.
