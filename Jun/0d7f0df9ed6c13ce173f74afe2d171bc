SAA announced on Friday that it would institute an investigation into how its outgoing CEO Vuyani Jarana's resignation letter was leaked. The board said that because of the leak, it had decided to hold a meeting off site - at the Rothschild Boardroom - to discuss matters relating to SAA and the new interim CEO "We were not certain where the leak had come from and so we decided to move to an office space that we know is regularly swept and if there is any untoward behaviour [by way of leaks] it could be tracked very quickly," said board member Thandeka Mgodoso. She said it was not clear how Jarana's resignation letter had been leaked as it was "very secure" and "no one had a copy of the letter", barring the SAA chairperson.   Mgodoso said the investigation would try to ascertain how exactly the letter could have been leaked. She said several security measures had been put in place "to the extent that none of the board members sitting here, except the chairman had a copy of the letter after the board meeting of May 30". "Even the chairperson will be part of the investigation," she said. SAA's General Manager: Operations Zuks Ramasia was announced as the new acting interim CEO at the briefing. The board said that Jarana's term would come to an end on Monday when Ramasia would officially take over. Jarana had previously indicated that he was prepared to work out a three-month period, which he would continue to do, to assist Ramasia until the end of August. However, Ramasia would officially step into the CEO role as of Monday  https://www.fin24.com/Companies/saa-to-investigate-leak-of-jarana-resignation-letter-20190607
