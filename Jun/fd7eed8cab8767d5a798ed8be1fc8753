WHEN Khanyisani Mdletshe (40) went blind after suffering meningitis at the age of 11, he sat at home doing nothing. But in 2001, his life changed for the better. “I started a project for the blind so that I could help people with some of the problems I faced while growing up,” said Khanyisani, from Magabeni, south of Durban. He said the project was legally registered in 2007. “When I started the project it was an ABET school for blind people to help them finish matric,” he said. “But when we found that those people had nowhere to go after matric, we started making music and other activities. We also introduced sport.” Khanyisani is the chairman of the Disabled People’s Movement, and has managed to get funds to buy material used by blind people. “I couldn’t finish school and I realised there were many people who had the same problem. So I thought we could have our own school and reduce the load we all carry. Today we are a registered institution and we also have cricket players and musicians because of the project,” said Khanyisani. He said he won’t stop fighting for the rights of blind people. “We are also humans. Being blind doesn’t make us less human. “We have the same rights as others. We also have the right to education and housing. “I’m currently talking to eThekwini Municipality to provide us with RDPs.”
