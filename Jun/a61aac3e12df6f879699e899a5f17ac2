A teenager
accused of being one of a pair of robbers who held up a teacher and pupils at
Sea Point High School while they were writing their exams will remain in police
custody after appearing in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The 14-year-old pupil’s mother, who
sat outside the courtroom for juveniles ahead of her son’s appearance, declined
to speak about what had happened on Sunday when her son was arrested at his
home in Philippi East. According to police, six cellphone
covers, believed to have been stolen during the robbery, was found at the boy’s
home. The pupil was identified through
CCTV footage. The case was postponed to June 12
for further investigation. The brazen attack last Wednesday
saw two armed suspects jump the school fence on Wednesday morning and
threatened the teacher and pupils before fleeing with their cellphones. Many schools routinely ask that
pupils put their cellphones into a box before sitting to write an exam. Jessica Shelver, spokesperson for
education MEC Debbie Schafer, said the department welcomed the quick arrest and
would continue to follow the progress of the matter. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/pupil-in-dock-on-robbery-charge-at-sea-point-school-after-being-identified-via-cctv-20190610
