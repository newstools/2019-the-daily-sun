BUSHBUCKRIDGE police are looking for the family of Patrick Ndou. Patrick (46) from Zimbabwe is a patient at Mapulaneng Hospital in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. He told hospital management and police he came to Mzansi in 2 000. He lived with a friend in Ka-Xikukwana Village in Giyani, Limpopo, before moving to Bushbuckridge. He’s been at the hospital since 2016, and was being treated for a mental illness. The hospital said he was dropped off at the facility by a Good Samaritan who found him roaming the streets. He didn’t have any money or proper documents. Patrick told Daily Sun he was feeling much better and wanted to be reunited with his family. Bushbuckridge police spokeswoman Constable Maryline Mmonwa appealed to anyone who can help Patrick find his family to come forward. According to Patrick, his sister is Muthelo and she’s married to George Moyo, and their daughter’s name is Lizzy. Anyone with information that can help Patrick should contact Constable Mmonwa at 079 8915 005.
