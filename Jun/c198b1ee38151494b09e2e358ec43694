POLICE pounced on the pupils without warning! And what they found left them in shock. Cops expected to find the pupils carrying books and other study material, but they were disappointed to find a screwdriver and cigarette lighter. Tshwane West police conducted a social crime prevention campaign at Wespark Primary School on Friday. They searched mostly grade 6 and 7 pupils. They said they were informed by the principal to search for dangerous weapons and cigarettes, which pupils sometimes brought into the school. Tshwane West police spokeswoman Constable Sibongile Vuma said they searched eight classrooms. “A total of eight classes were searched and a screwdriver and cigarette lighter were confiscated from a pupil. The teacher for health and safety kept the items safe to show the pupil’s parents what was found in their possession,” said Vuma. She said cop also patrolled around the area after the school search for visibility in the Elandspoort area. They distributed pamphlets with messages about domestic violence and assault. She said the pamphlets were given to community members going in and out of a shop. “The community was happy to see men and women in blue taking time to inform them on how to report crime,” she said. Vuma said the community was also given the station’s contact details.
