THERE is an air of optimism across South Africa ahead of the International Netball Federation World Cup, scheduled for Liverpool in England on 12 to 21 July. Mzansi’s senior national netball team, the Spar Proteas, are brimming with confidence and beaming with smiles as the date for the World Cup approaches. With money turning the globe, Netball SA president Cecilia Molokwane said they will pay players a whopping R1 million should the team win the tournament. They will pocket R700 000 should they finish as runners-up, and they will be rewarded with R500 000 for finishing in third place. The host nation England, defending champions Australia and title contenders New Zealand are the favourites to lift the trophy, with Mzansi having an outside chance. The Proteas are confident they will cause an upset. Team captain Bongiwe Msomi and her teammates left for Wales yesterday to start their World Cup preparations. The Proteas, drawn in Group C with Jamaica, Fiji and Trinidad and Tobago, will be involved in two test series against Wales in Cardiff before they head to Liverpool. They face Trinidad and Tobago in their opening game on 12 July in Liverpool (6.05pm SA time). Msomi told SunSport: “There will never be a good time for us to do well at the World Cup than now. “We believe that we have a great squad, which brings with it a great chance of winning a medal. I only hear about a million rand but I have never seen it with my eyes. “I don’t know whether I should be excited or not.”
