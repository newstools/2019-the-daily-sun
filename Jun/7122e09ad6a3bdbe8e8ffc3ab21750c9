FOR three weeks, the family of Rethabile Sematle has been living with parts of his remains. Family members of the 27-year-old, who was necklaced on his way home from work last month, said they couldn’t bury his ashes until police had finished with DNA testing. Rethabile’s aunt Lebogang Choshane (41) said the ashes were wrapped tightly in a black plastic bag at the family home in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni. Lebogang said Rethabile was walking back from his job as a security guard when he was attacked. “We got worried when he didn’t arrive home on time, which was unusual. “We then overheard members of the community talking about a man who had been necklaced next to the Daveyton train station,” she said. “We rushed to the police station to see the body of the victim. They told us the body had been taken to another mortuary and we should return the next day.” Lebogang said on their way back, they learnt from community members the man who had been burnt to death was Rethabile. “We heard angry community members were chasing a man who had robbed a woman of her handbag when they came across Rethabile,” she said. “Without any questions, they assumed it was him and started attacking him.” Lebogang said the family was not comfortable living with his ashes. “We often dream of him surrounded by ashes. He is not at peace and we are also unable to move on with our lives,” she said. At the time of going to print, the cop’s Sergeant Constance Moalusi had not yet responded to Daily Sun inquiries.
