THE all-electric Jaguar I-Pace has won Best Electric Powertrain, Best New Engine, and the 350 to 450PS category at The International Engine + Powertrain of the Year Awards. The show took place in Stuttgart, GVemany. The panel of 70 expert motoring journalists from 31 countries looked into key characteristics such as performance, driveability, energy efficiency and refinement. These three titles recognise the technical excellence of the I-Pace’s zero emissions powertrain, which was designed and developed in-house.  Ian Hoban of Jaguar Land Rover said: “We’ve used all the benefits of state-of-the-art battery and motor technology to create a world-class electric vehicle. “As well as zero emissions, the all-electric powertrain delivers an ideal balance of performance, refinement and range, together with outstanding responsiveness, agility and day-to-day usability. “The I-Pace is a true driver’s car and, above all, a true Jaguar.”  It’s capable of charging from 0-80% in a maximum 72 minutes using a 60kW DC charger, or 0-100% in around 12 hours when using a 7kW AC wallbox – ideal for overnight charging at home. The battery is placed centrally between the two axles, and as low down as possible.
