AFTER nearly not making it into Egypt because he did not have Visa, Bafana super fan Botha Msila is now getting a royal treatment. The BLOEMFONTEIN CELTIC and Bafana Bafana super fan has fullfilled his dream of hitch-hiking from Mzansi to Cairo, to watch the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations tournament. But after passing Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya, Msila encountered problems when he intended to cross into Ethiopia from Kenya where the latter’s immigration officials sent him back to Kenya to apply for the visa. “Despite my concerted pleas with the Ethiopian officials, my dream came tumbling down when Ethiopian officials flatly denied me entry saying I needed a visa going forward,” he said at the time. After three days at the border between Kenya and Ethiopia pleading for help, Msila went to Nairobi where he was helped by the South African Embassy to apply for the Egypt visa. He got it (visa) on Thursday and boarded a flight to Ethiopia and finally arrived in Cairo, Egypt on Friday, 21 June, where his first port of call was the Bafana Bafana hotel. “I can’t wait for the games to begin. That is why I am here,” he said. Now on Sunday, Msila arrived at the AL Salam Stadium in Egypt like royalty to watch the game between Namibia and Morocco. The video was shared on Twitter by Robert Marawa. In the video, Msila thanked Marawa and other South Africans for making it possible for him to be in Egypt.
