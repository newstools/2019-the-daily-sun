A  wife from the North West allegedly burnt her husband’s car outside a cop shop! He was inside reporting his wife’s abusive ways while she torched his bakkie outside. Cop spokesman Justie Ramaube tells TimesLive that the 47 year-old woman appeared in court today on a charge of malicious damage to property. The fiery incident happened outside of the Boksburg North police station at the weekend. Ramaube said the husband went to the police station on Sunday to seek help, saying he had been abused by his wife. He added that while the man tried to open a protection order against her, she went outside and set his Nissan bakkie alight. "The woman is alleged to have set her husband's car alight, which at the end affected one police officer's car very badly. "A community member who witnessed the [incident] alerted the police who then (searched for her and) ... arrested her a few miles from the station," he said.
