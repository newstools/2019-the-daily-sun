ENGLISH Premier League side Brighton and Hove Albion have confirmed that they will again loan Percy Tau out due to strict work-permit rules in Europe. Even though the club did not reveal much information about Tau’s next destination, all indications are that he might continue playing for Belgium’s second-division side, Union Saint-Gilloise, where he had already spent a season. Les Unionistes Union 60, as they are known, would be happy to continue with Tau, who was instrumental in helping them finish third in the past season. This would mean another season for Tau playing outside of the EPL, where his dream has always been when the 25-year-old left Mamelodi Sundowns at a record fee of over R50 million. “Albion’s South African star (Percy Tau) will be loaned out again this season due to work permit obstacles,’’ said reports from England yesterday. “Tau spent last season on loan to Union Saint-Gilloise, the Belgian second tier club of Brighton owner-chairman Tony Bloom.” The inability to obtain the England work-permit since Bafana Bafana are outside of the top 50 in Fifa’s world-rankings, and his national team caps means Tau will have to wait a little longer. Tau was named Proximus Player of the Season after he scored 12 goals in 35 appearances in all competitions for the club in his first season. He is currently in camp with Bafana Bafana as they prepare for the upcoming African Cup of Nations (Afcon) set to start on Friday. Tau’s situation can change if he can help steer Bafana to Afcon glory, which would significantly improve South Africa’s world rankings before the 2019-20 season gets underway. This would mean Tau may meet the criteria to obtain the work permit. According to the latest Fifa rankings, Bafana are ranked 72 in the world.
