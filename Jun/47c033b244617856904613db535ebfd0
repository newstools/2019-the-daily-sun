Love is in the air and it has been for artist
Okmalumkoolkat. Is he off the market of they are just friends? His fans were worried that he is getting married when he
dropped his hit single Amalobolo. It seems like he was dropping a hint that he
wants to pay lobola to his alleged long term girlfriend Princess Zulu whom he
features on the music video. The pair have managed to keep their relationship
on the down low but they do take pictures and holidays. I belong to meeeee..? A post shared by  Princess Zulu (@princess_zulu) on Mar 3, 2019 at 11:44am PST  ?
