THE lifeless bodies lay next to each other in a pool of blood. Sergeant Sduduzo Ngubane, who was based at Kranskop cop shop, allegedly shot his girlfriend Hloniphile Gcaba before turning the gun on himself. The incident happened at KwaMashu Hostel yesterday morning, apparently after a heated argument. Although it’s not yet clear what led to the gruesome incident, Ngubane allegedly fought with his girlfriend over a cellphone message which he found on her cellphone. The message was apparently from another man, and they argued when he asked her about it. The officer allegedly pulled out a gun and shot his girlfriend to death before shooting himself. A resident told Daily Sun they were awoken by gunshots. “I thought it was just one of those shootings that often take place when people get robbed. But I later discovered a cop had shot his girlfriend and himself. At the moment we’re not sure why he did this. “But some people claim it was over a message the girlfriend received on her cellphone from another man.” KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of murder and an inquest docket were opened at KwaMashu Police Station after a cop allegedly shot his girlfriend before shooting himself.
