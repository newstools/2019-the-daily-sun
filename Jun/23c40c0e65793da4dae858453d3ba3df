EVERY year, illegal initiation schools kidnap boys and force parents to pay for them to be freed. Isihlangu Sobukhwari Namasiko in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, has warned the kidnappers to stop this practice or face arrest. This as initiation season is expected to start this weekend. The organisation’s chairman, Johannes Mashiane, said: “These bogus surgeons kidnap boys, and often the victims end up with injuries because many of these schools’ owners are not trained. “Legal initiation schools do proper work and know the procedure to be followed.” Mashiane said boys die at these schools because they don’t get proper care and aren’t fed properly. He said last year they rescued about 20 boys in KwaThema, Duduza and Daveyton. “We warn parents to watch over their kids. Boys are lured by friends, who are promised money by illegal initiation schools.” He said cops now escort them as some illegal initiation school owners are violent. Last year, government looked at getting drones to scout these schools as the department of traditional affairs was worried about the increase in the number of bogus schools. Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe of Etwatwa cop shop said they’d work with the organisation where necessary.
