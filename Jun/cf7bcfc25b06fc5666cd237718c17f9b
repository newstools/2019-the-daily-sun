THE villagers often went for long periods without water and could not understand why. But they finally got the answer last Thursday when a 28-year-old Mpumalanga man who operates a water tanker was arrested and charged with malicious damage to property. Nkomazi Municipality had been swamped with complaints from KaMaqhekeza residents who had not been receiving water for long periods. The municipality’s officials investigated. That was when they discovered that, probably to boost his business, a man had allegedly interfered with a pipe near his home to stop the flow of water to the rest of the village. “The community was always complaining about their water running out,” said municipal spokesman Cyril Repinga. This was despite all systems showing there was water flowing to the area. “Officials went to check the pipes and found the man had stopped water in the pipe going through his yard from reaching other villagers,” he said. The man allegedly sold a 1 000 litres of water to residents for R250. Tonga police spokesman Captain Magonseni Nkosi confirmed the man’s arrest. He is out on R2 000 bail.
