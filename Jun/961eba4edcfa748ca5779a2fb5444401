  PEOPLE
living in and around Phalaborwa in Limpopo have been warned to be careful, as
14 lions are on the loose. Limpopo
Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism (LEDET) spokesperson
Zaid Kalla confirmed the escape of about fourteen lions, that are roaming
around Phalaborwa near the Foskor Mine. The lions
are suspected to have escaped from the Kruger National Park today and a team of
field rangers have been allocated to closely monitor the situation. "In a
meeting held between the department and Kruger National Park agreed that the
lions are to be captured soon and taken back to Kruger National Park,"
Kalla said. Employees
working at Foskor Mine and local residents were therefore advised to be alert
at all times.
