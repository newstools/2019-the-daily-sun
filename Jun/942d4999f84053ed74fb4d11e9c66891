RESERVE Bank official Shiwa Mazibuko yesterday pleaded with law enforcement agencies to help finalise more than 60 corruption cases against Gupta companies. Mazibuko was testifying at the Zondo Commission about suspicious transactions between Gupta company Homix and several service providers. He said the Reserve Bank opened 64 cases against the Guptas but nothing happened. Mazbibuko said Homix had more than R660 million in a Standard Bank account but it was unclear what business they did. He said for months, nothing happened with the account, before there was suddenly a lot of activity in March 2014. “This should have raised a red flag because banks monitor movements in accounts. This is how money laundering happens,” said Mazibuko. “Homix would get money from state-owned entities and immediately transfer it to unrelated traders. Homix would only leave enough money for bank fees.” He said Homix was registered as a textile importer but the companies they had arrangements with had nothing to do with textiles. Homix would deposit money into companies’ accounts and it would be deposited back, sometimes on the same day. “The layering plays a vital role in hiding the proceeds of crime. When you layer it, you put it into different accounts,” said Mazibuko. “The whole purpose is to hide the origin of money from officials or authorities. It seems quite a number of people benefited from kickbacks from state-owned enterprises.” He said two of the companies, Bapu and Ballatore, disappeared as soon as money was deposited in their accounts. “We could not even find what type of business they were doing with Homix,” said Mazibuko.
