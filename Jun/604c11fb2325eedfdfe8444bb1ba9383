KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed the signing of Zambian international Lazarous Kambole from Zesco United on a three-year contract. The talented striker will join Amakhosi effectively on 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2022. Following their disappointing season where they finished outside of the top 8 for the first time in over a decade, Amakhosi are hoping to build a stronger team to challenge for trophies next season. The Glamour Boys are hoping to add some fire power upfront with the signing of Kambole after Leonardo Castro was transfer-listed while Ryan Moon was not offered a new contract. The 25-year-old was a part of the Zambian team that recently won the COSAFA Cup with a victory in the final over Botswana.
