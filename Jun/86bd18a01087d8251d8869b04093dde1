SIBUSISO Gumede is a worried young man. The 29-year-old from Jozini, northern KZN, told Daily Sun that he has been trying to apply for an ID for the past 10 years, but with no luck. He said his life had reached a standstill because he couldn’t get a job without an ID. “I’m unemployed. I rely on my parents for all my basic needs, and it doesn’t feel good because they’re approaching old age,” said Sibusiso. He said he never had a birth certificate, and he couldn’t understand why his parents never bothered to apply for one. “Now I’m suffering. If my parents had applied for a birth certificate, I wouldn’t be battling to get an ID,” said Sibusiso. He said he had visited different Home Affairs branches around his area. “Officials told me I needed to go for an interview so that my identity would be verified. “I’ve been to branches such as Bhambanana, Obonjeni and Mboza. All of them were unable to give me an ID,” said Sibusiso. Cyril Mncwabe, a spokesman for KZN Home Affairs, told the People’s Paper: “Dates for interviews for the Bhambanana office have not been issued yet. The client will be informed of the date as soon as it has been communicated to the office.”
