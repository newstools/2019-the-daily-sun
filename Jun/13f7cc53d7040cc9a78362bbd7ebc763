THE fact that Banyana Banyana are winless in their last 10 outings does not mean they are not ready for the Fifa Women's World Cup. This is according to captain Janine Van Wyk, who reckons Banyana are as ready as any other World Cup debutant. South Africa will make their World Cup bow on Saturday evening (6pm) when they tackle Spain in their Group B opener, a group which also contains China and Germany, at Oceane Stadium in Le Havre. Desiree Ellis charges are the lowest-ranked (49) country in their group as Spain and China are ranked 13 and 16 respectively.Germany, who are the reigning Olympic champions, are in second spot in the world. “A lot of people have been saying we have not won a single game in our recent matches.” said confident Van Wyk, a veteran of over 150 caps. “We played against highly-ranked opponents, the world champions. We could have played against the likes of Botswana and Zimbabwe, and other lowly-ranked teams and beaten them. "People would be saying we are ready. But because we have lost against credible opponents, there comes the question about our state of readiness. “But, personally, I think we are prepared and ready. We are 100% sure what's coming in the tournament.”
