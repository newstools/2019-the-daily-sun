FONG kong goods cost the movie industry millions of rands each year. Cinemas and video shops are also affected by fake DVDs sold at street corners. This has led to video shops shutting down. On Friday Metro cops, police and the Film and Production Board staff raided stalls in the Joburg CBD to get rid of fake products. They moved from one street vendor to another, although few others were able to quickly pack up their goods and flee, howeverNine street traders were bust and are facing charges ranging form contravening the Film and Publications Act to fraud. They’re expected to appear in various courts today. Joburg Metro cops spokesman Wayne Minnaar said the operation was a huge success. At least 8 000 DVDs with the street value of R80 000 were seized. He said most DVDs were selling for R10. This is believed to be the cheap process that traders embark on in producing these fake DVS. It is understood that traders make multiple copies of original DVDs and sell fake copies. Minnaar told Daily Sun: “Artists suffer a huge financial loss in the process.” In March it was reported that the board destroyed over 100 000 fong kong DVDs in Cape Town and Durban alone. Their street value was estimated at R11 million. According to reports, the board has confiscated 193 000 illegal DVDs in the past year. It also issued 116 notices for non-compliance of unclassified material, unregistered distributors and non-renewal of licences. It is estimated that 40% of the DVDs in the market are pirated!
