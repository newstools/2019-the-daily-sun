MMC Mpho Phalatse visited the families of two kids who died of food poisoning yesterday. The Joburg MMC was accompanied by councillors, social workers and other municipal officials. This came after Phalatse learned on Tuesday that the two kids were from the same Westdene preschool. It’s alleged the school didn’t have a proper permit. “So far, we have shut down 10 illegal preschools in the area. “We need to teach communities about things to look out for when leaving their children in preschools.” Captain Jerbes de Bruyn confirmed a case was opened and said they were waiting for a toxicology report. Fanula Wabets, one of the parents, said: “I only found out about it when I went to the preschool to fetch her. I’m deeply sad and really hope justice will be served.” Antoinette Assegaai, the other parent, said: “I was reckless in not checking whether it was legal or not, but that doesn’t justify my child’s death.”
