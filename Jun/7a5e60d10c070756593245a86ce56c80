The economy took centre stage on Thursday night as President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his State of the Nation address in Cape Town. From saving Eskom to cutting red tape and ensuring that data must fall, here's everything you need to know. 1. Priorities    The president announced that government will urgently table a special appropriations bill to allocate a "significant portion" of the R230bn fiscal support the power utility will require over the next few years sooner rather than later. Further details on this would be revealed by Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Following the resignation of its CEO Phakamani Hadebe in late May, a new Eskom head is yet to be appointed. The president said government will "soon" appoint a chief restructuring officer at the power utility who will be expected to "reposition Eskom financially with careful attention to the mix between revenue, debt and cost structure of the company". Mboweni had announced the creation of the role during his Budget in February. Ramaphosa added that government was also working with Eskom to address its overall debt as well as the debt owed by municipalities and individuals.  3. On expanding productive sectors Ramaphosa said government would give priority to economic sectors that have the greatest potential for growth. These include clothing and textiles, gas, chemicals and plastics, renewables, and steel and metals fabrication sectors. Additionally, the focus will also be on agriculture and the agro-processing sector by developing new markets and reducing SA's reliance on agricultural imports. 4. Bringing economic development to communities Government plans to create special more economic zones and "revive local industrial parks, business centres, digital hubs and township and village enterprises". 5. Renewal of SA's brand Ramaphosa said tourism would continue to be a key focus area for his administration. This means a renewal of the SA brand, as well as introducing a "world-class visa regime" with a special focus on the Chinese and Indian markets.  6. On ensuring that data must fall Ramaphosa announced the communications minister will issue the policy direction to The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) to commence the spectrum licensing process.               10. On jobs Government hopes to create two million new jobs for young people within the next decade, said Ramaphosa. "This plan will work across government departments and all three tiers of government, in partnership with the private sector," he said. https://www.fin24.com/Economy/everything-you-need-to-know-about-how-ramaphosa-plans-to-fix-the-economy-20190620
