Animal print has made a big comeback on runways across the world. Stephen Manzini, founder of the Soweto Fashion Week, said they were excited to show lovers of fashion the latest trends from established and new brands this week. The three-day show will start on Thursday with an exclusive preview for the media and VIPs and end on Saturday. It takes place at the Zone 6 Venue in Diepkloof, Soweto. “Our passion is for unearthing top talent in the fashion industry. “Soweto is alive with creativity, with many designers longing to establish themselves on big stages, and that’s what we are all about.” Stephen said designers are expected to show their autumn/winter collections incorporating the theme, which is cowhide. Khanyi Magubane, spokeswoman for the event, said they were excited about this year’s event. She said not only was it at a different venue, but it would also be more vibrant as many young designers would be featured. “We are taking things to another level, even bringing designers from New York to be part of this growing fashion show. “The growth has attracted the attention of designers from all over the world,” she said. Khanyi said designers showing their work on the night are creative and authentic. “We have young designers who are able to capture the spirit of Soweto in their garments. “Their work is original and they are are hungry to show it on such a big fashion stage. “We will have a special preview with celebrities on the runway on one night. “The event will have 75 models representing women of all shapes and sizes,” said Khanyi.
