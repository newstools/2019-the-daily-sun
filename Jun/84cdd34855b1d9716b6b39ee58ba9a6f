Dear Mizzb MY partner is no longer the person she used to be. She is no longer talking to me and seems to come up with excuses every time I want to have sex with her. I am starved of sex in this relationship and feel like finding someone to sleep with. Dear Frustrated Communication is always an important part of a relationship. A relationship is a partnership between two people. People are scared of talking and asking their partners if they still want to be with them or not. It is important to let your partner know how you feel and the thoughts that you have and allow her to clarify. Coupleâ€™s counselling will help you both decide on a way forward.
