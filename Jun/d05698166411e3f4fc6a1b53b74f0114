MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has reiterated that he is the one who trains his squad, picks his playing 11 and makes the substitutions, meaning he has the final say in the team. Mosimane was speaking to the media about the season that has just ended when the issue of Rhulani Mokwena popped up. When Rhulani left and joined Orlando Pirates, there were insinuations that Mosimane owed his success to Mokwena’s tactical acumen. The debate was re-ignited by the Bongani Zungu Tweet where he highly praised Rhulani. The Tweet, which was later  deleted, caused an uproar in the PSL circles. “I am cool with Rhulani. Why not? He’s a good boy. I like Rhulani,” said Mosimane. “I know you’re asking because of those things of the past. That thing was disturbing. I can show you guys my text exchanges with Bongani Zungu. "He’s also a good boy. He thanked me for all the support we gave him and said that I made him a number six and now he is playing in Europe. “The other things are smaller-nyana issues and they don’t last. If you go back and follow, you’ll see that I trained the team and picked the team. "And you know how life is, the results will show, you do not answer back, results will say everything. THESE ARE YOUNG GUYS AND THEY MUST RESPECT ME,” said Mosimane. Mosimane added: “I have never said anything against him (Rhulani). In a relationship, you can’t be always right. I say sorry to my players when I’ve made a mistake. Ask Sundowns players…and I get back love, no one is perfect. "They say the weakness of a person is not your potential or what you do, it is the ego that can stop you from being the greatest. I don’t bear grudges because football is too short and we need each other. "I speak to Rhulani, I am good with Rhulani, I am also good with Bongani Zungu, I need to move and show I am a bigger person.”
