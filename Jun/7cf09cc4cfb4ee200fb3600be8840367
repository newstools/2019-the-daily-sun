THE KTC Neighbourhood Watch in Nyanga needs more support from the municipality. Manelisi Sisusa (41), chairman of the patrollers in the Cape Town squatter camp, said they got very little help to do their jobs properly. “We last got help in 2017 in the form of 20 jackets with reflectors. “In the past year we received nothing. “We have no torches or radios despite this neighbourhood watch being 15 years old,” said Sisusa. He said they also needed a cellphone or small camera to capture evidence when they bust thugs. Sisusa said they believed if they had the right equipment the crime in their area would decline. “We have an office in Fezeka. We just need a computer to enable us to run social media campaigns and communicate via emails.” His comment came after the city’s safety and security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith recently announced that nearly R3 million was spent on new equipment for neighbourhood watch groups during this financial year. Smith said the equipment which was donated included dash cams, body cams, reflective jackets and vests as well as rechargeable flashlights, headlamps, spotlights, floodlights, first aid kits, fire extinguishers, backpacks, hand radios and accessories. “It’s been more than a 10 years since efforts got underway to strengthen community policing structures and we have seen good results. “The city and province continue to plough resources into the Neighbourhood Watch support programme because we recognise the value in it,” said Smith.
