HOMELESS residents were expecting to move into new flats but instead rubber bullets started flying. “I was fixing a car when I heard gunshots. I lifted my head and was hit by a rubber bullet. Police came into the kasi and shot at us,” said Danisile Tika of Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Mfuleni residents had blocked the Old Faure Road last Thursday, demanding to be housed in the new flats. Leader Nkokheli Ncambela said families were expecting to move into the new Forest Village housing development in Eerste River. This was after some people had tried to occupy the flats two days earlier but were stopped. Ward councillor Jerome Fitz said he was not part of the protest. “We receive names of beneficiaries from the Western Cape government. I’ve explained this many times,” Fitz told Daily Sun. Marcellino Martin, a spokesman for Human Settlements MEC Tertius Simmers, said the attempt to illegally occupy flats was regrettable. Police could not confirm the shooting but said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. Police said a truck was set on fire but no one was arrested.
