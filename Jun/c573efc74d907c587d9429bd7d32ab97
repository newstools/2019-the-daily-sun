Avenue in Arboretum Richards Bay. Netcare 911 Media Liaison Officer, Shawn Herbst said reports from the
scene indicate that an adult female had also sustained a gunshot wound to her
leg. â€œHer two children both minors escaped injury," said Herbst. Herbst said another adult male who was a neighbour who responded to the
calls for help was also fatally wounded when the armed men were escaping. "The people that were fatally wounded were declared deceased on the
scene by a private ambulance," he said. "The adult female was transported by a private ambulance service to
hospital for further treatment," he added. Herbst said circumstances leading up to the shooting will be
investigated by the SAPS who were on scene.
