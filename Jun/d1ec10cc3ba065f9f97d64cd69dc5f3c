LONG serving Inkatha Freedom Party (IFPP MP) Sibongike Nkomo
has died. The news of her passing was confirmed by the party earlier
today in a statement. Nkomo (63)died last night after a long illness at a Durban
hospital.  “In 2013 the IFP deployed Ms Nkomo to the National Assembly
until the 8 May 2019 National and Provincial Elections. In Parliament she
amongst other committees served in Finance, Home Affairs and Tourism. Ms Nkomo was a competent, analytical and dedicated Member of
Parliament”. “Owing to her ill health Ms Nkomo stepped down as the IFP
Secretary General in January 2019 in an effort to tend to her health and also
give the Party an opportunity to focus on the 2019 Elections. We had hoped that
she would return to good health and continue her servant leadership to the IFP
and South Africa.” Nkomo was a nurse by profession before politics called her
close. In 1999 she was the IFP’s Premier Candidate for Gauteng. She
also served previously as the IFP Women’s Brigade Gauteng Provincial Secretary
and later the IFPWB Publicity Secretary before being elected IFP Secretary
General. “In all her elected positions in the IFP and those of public
office Ms Nkomo always gave of her best. She was a trusted leader in the IFP
and a committed servant of the people”, reads the statement. She is survived by her daughter Zama, her mother and four
brothers. The IFP shares this deep loss with the Nkomo family, and we
mourn with them and offer them our most sincere and heartfelt condolences.
