THE family of the two women who were shot and killed on Tuesday said they don’t feel safe. Sandile Nkomo (37) and her sister, Zama Kubheka (31) died instantly when unknown gunmen stormed into their home in Greytown, KwaZulu-Natal. Two kids, Kwanele (5) and Akhona (8) were wounded during the attack and are still in hospital. Nkomo’s daughter, Noxolo (19) said they are planning to move somewhere else. “We don’t know what the attackers wanted. We think they might come back for more killing,” said Noxolo. She said it’s obvious the attackers wanted them dead. The attackers didn’t take anything during the attack. She said she was sleeping at the other family house not far from the first home where the incident happened. KZN police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbele said at about 02.30am on Tuesday a family was allegedly attacked in their home in Lilani Reserve by unknown gunmen. “Two women sustained multiple gunshot wounds and were pronounced dead at the scene. Two children were taken to hospital for medical attention, with multiple gunshot wounds. Ematimatolo police are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder,” said Mbele.
