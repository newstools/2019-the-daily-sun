Local entertainer Zodwa Wabantu shared how she keeps her skin looking youthful! Zodwa is the latest celebrity to try the bloody 'vampire facial' made famous by American reality star and businesswoman Kim Kardashian. According to Beyond beauty by Health24 The PRP facial focuses on the face because it’s the most popular treatment for its skin rejuvenation effect, but Platelet-Rich Plasma treatment is being used ever more effectively from head to toe to treat all sorts of aesthetic and health-related issues.Why do I need a vampire facial?Unless you have a specific blood disorder or skin disorder, an infection or are pregnant or breastfeeding, PRP is suitable for just about everyone.The injection of the growth factor-rich PRP cocktail boosts collagen production and cellular tissue regeneration, so PRP treatments can improve the appearance of skin tone (dark circles and dullness), reducing pore size, acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles (on the forehead and around the eyes and mouth) and well as boosting firmness, elasticity and general skin condition.As growth is so drastically stimulated, the PRP treatment has not only proven to be a very effective anti-ageing treatment, but has further shown great results in hair, muscle and joint regeneration.How do I know I am a candidate for a vampire facial?If you have the following conditions, you should not have PRP treatments:Anyone who has a blood or skin disorder or is on blood-thinning medicationIf you have a medical condition or infection that could worsen or spread with injectionsIf you are on isotretinoin treatment (e.g., Roaccutane)If you are pregnant or breast-feedingIf you have cancerIf you have had any facial waxing done close to the treatmentIs PRP safe?Risks and complications are low because you are using your own blood. But for this reason, you need to have this treatment done by a reputable, qualified medical practitioner or under their supervision by a qualified therapist who uses strict hygiene and application protocols.How do I prepare for the PRP treatment?PRP is a medical treatment, so you would need to have a personal consultation with one of The Renewal Institute’s doctors to give a full medical history and assess whether you are a candidate for PRP.Once you’re given the go-ahead, you will need to stop using vitamin-A skin care like Retin A and retinols, AHA and BHA treatment and other topic medications for 3-5 days before your treatment.Use a sunscreen daily and avoid sunburn before the treatment.After the treatment, you will be given a home-care routine and instructions.What may I expect during the PRP treatment?The practitioner will decide on which application method to use, depending on your specific needs.
