FOOTBALL’S governing body Fifa says it is "currently looking into" Cameroon's behaviour during their Fifa Women's World Cup last-16 defeat by England. England's 3-0 victory on Sunday was spoiled by Cameroon's reaction to two video assistant referee (VAR) decisions and poor challenges on England players. There was an on-pitch protest by Cameroon players after England's second goal, scored by Ellen White, which was awarded through VAR aid. Cameroon were also visibly upset when  Ajara Nchout's goal was ruled offside by VAR.According to BBC Sport, a Fifa spokesperson said: "further updates will be provided in due course". Earlier on Monday, Isha Johansen, chair of the Confederation of African Football's women's the football committee said she wanted an investigation to be opened. Johansen, who is also the president of the Sierra Leone Football Association, said it was an "embarrassing situation". In a statement, she said: "Whilst remaining proud of our African teams that participated in the Fifa Women's World Cup, yesterday's match between England and Cameroon reflected badly, not only on African women's football but African football on the whole. "It is an issue which will be addressed and dealt with at the appropriate levels of governance. "Cameroon were fortunate to finish the game with 11 players on the pitch after Yvonne Leuko was booked for an apparent elbow on England winger Nikita Parris, Augustine Ejangue spat on Toni Duggan and Alexandra Takounda was shown a yellow card for a late challenge on the captain Steph Houghton in stoppage time. Speaking after the match, England boss Phil Neville said he was "ashamed" by Cameroon's behaviour, adding it "didn't feel like football".But Cameroon coach Alain Djeumfa blamed the referee in his post-match conference, saying the match was a miscarriage of justice.
