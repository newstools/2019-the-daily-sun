Banyana Banyana have put their humiliating 7-2 defeat to Norway on Sunday behind them, according to forward Ode Fulutudile. In fact, the 29-year-old believes they can use the defeat as motivation at the fast approaching FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. “Every player knows that the last loss was not a true reflection of who we are,” said Fulutudile. “Honestly there is a way that it could end playing in our advantage because it could give Spain a false sense of who we are and what we are capable of, allowing them to drop their guard a little bit. “If at the end of the day we make it to the knockout stages, then we will take this loss any time. "The only thing the loss tainted was our image, it didn’t really affect us in any other way. “We can use it to our advantage instead of allowing it to break us down.” Fulutudile, who is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), is looking forward to turning up for Banyana in their maiden World Cup. She earned her first call up in October 2018 for the international friendly against Chile after catching the eye of Desiree Ellis whilst in Finland. The striker will be hoping to crack the starting line-up when Banyana open their World Cup campaign against Spain at Oceane Stadium in Le Havre on Saturday (6pm). “Each player is looking forward to it, “added Fulutudile. “The nerves are there but I think every player will be up for the fight. Hopefully I will score the winning goal for the team.”
