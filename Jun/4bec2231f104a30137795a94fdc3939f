Relationships can be so beautiful but they also can be quite
complicated. So what are some of the deal breakers that shouldn’t be
ignored. We asked Sun Readers to share with us what are some of the
red flags to look for in a relationship. Here’s what some had to say: Lykos: When she talks on her cell phone during sex as if
nothing is happening. Mluleki: The moment she starts saying NO when I'm trying to
make love on her, her sudden lack of interest in sex. Shouting at me and start
comparing me to some else. Sandile: 1. Calling five times a day. 2. Demanding access to
your phone.3. Rocking up nje ngepatrek in my crib without informing. 4. Missing
her call infuriates her. 5. Wants you to dump your friends. 6. Gives you
ultimatums njalo nje Joy: When he borrows money from you to entertain the girl
