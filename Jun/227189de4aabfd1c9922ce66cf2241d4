NEWLY-PROMOTED Stellenbosch FC are looking to strengthen their side by signing striker Waseem Isaacs from National First Division (NFD) side Ubuntu FC. Isaacs is well-known to Stellies, having played against them several times in the NFD. The 28-year-old finished second in the scoring charts behind Stellenbosch’s Iqraam Rayners, and head coach Steve Barker believes the pair will strike up a lethal partnership in the PSL. “He is a good player and someone who gives us another option with his aerial ability. He is a different type of player to what we have. He can combine well with the likes of Iqraam,” said Barker. According to reports, this isn’t the first time Barker has tried to sign Isaacs. Apparently, he tried to bring him to the University of Pretoria when he was in charge there. So is clearly a big fan of the forward.
