Barberton Prison wants to prepare inmates for the outside world. On Wednesday, the prison launched a R2,5 million milking project. It aims to equip inmates with skills they can use after serving their sentences. People have been practising traditional agricultural methods for years. But the outdated methods made it difficult for inmates to find jobs since many dairy farms now use modern technology. Given Hlatshwayo (27), who’s serving a six-year prison term for attempted murder, said he’s happy to learn. “This will help improve our farming skills as technology is the future. “We’ll no longer work long hours as machines will do most of the work for us,” said Given. He said he’ll use the experience to improve his life after he’s released. “When I was sentenced my passion for agriculture grew,” he said. “I knew I had to use the opportunity to empower myself.” Correctional services acting area commissioner MidJohn Mhlongo said the project will shorten the time spent milking cows. “This is a great project and we promise to take care of the machines.” More than 4 000 offenders will benefit from the project. The machines are expected to improve production by at least 5%. Prison spokesman Messiah Hlungwani said the outside community and agricultural students will also be offered practical training.
