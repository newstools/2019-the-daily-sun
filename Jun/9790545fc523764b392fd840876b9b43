THERE have been several cases of rape and gender-based violence in Diepsloot. The body of 14-year-old Happy Khanyile was found in a shallow grave last year after she was apparently kidnapped, raped and mutilated. Residents of the kasi in the north of Joburg have been calling for police visibility. On Friday, Lawyers against Abuse held an anti-rape march in the kasi. The organisation, set up last year to provide support for gender violence victims, marched from Extension 1 taxi rank and ended up at Mashamplan squatter camp. They were joined by NPA and clinical forensic medicine staff, family child and sexual offences unit cops and other organisations. They chanted that they’ve had enough of gender-based violence. Walking around the kasi, they educated residents over a loudspeaker about their rights and of ways to report crime. They also handed out HIV testing pamphlets. The organisation’s Rethabile Mosese said: “We held an anti-rape march to raise awareness of gender-based violence and services in the community. “Several challenges contribute to a high violence rate. “We co-ordinated a Diepsloot stakeholders’ forum to reduce violence levels and to improve welfare, health and justice services,” she said, adding that gender violence was a serious crisis. “We no longer feel safe in our homes or on the streets. It is time we take a stand against this evil.”
