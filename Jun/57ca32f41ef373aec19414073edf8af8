RESIDENTS of Mbilini Road in KwaZakhele, Port Elizabeth, are angry. Their stormwater drain has been blocked for several months, and the smell of kak is the order of the day. Mary Fela (33) said: “Our drain hasn’t been working for a long time. It leaks kak.” She said the situation affected five houses on Mbilini Road. “We have been crying in vain. Since February, we’ve been calling the municipality. Every time municipal workers fix the drain, it leaks again within a week,” she said. “In April we raised R600 and hired a man in the kasi to help us. But the problem was only resolved for a month.” She said the drain blocked again on 20 May, and they called the municipality. “They sent a team on 24 May. They told us they couldn’t find the main drain. The following day a private company arrived and cleared the drain,” said Mary. “But on Monday the kak was back again.” She said they went to the councillor’s office. “The councillor called the municipality, but nothing happened.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mtubanzi Mniki said: “We aren’t failing the people. We are affected by vandalism. Thugs are stealing our drains and selling them to scrap metal firms. They then put rubbish inside pipes.”
