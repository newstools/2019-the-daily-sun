ANOTHER Africa Cup of Nations, another worst start by South Africa. The 1-0 defeat suffered at the hands of Ivory Coast certainly wasn’t part of the plan for Stuart Baxter. Yes, victory against the Elephants is always going to be a herculean task and needed much better effort than what Bafana put up at a sparsely-filled Al Salaam Stadium in Cairo. But a draw could have been a favourable result for South Africa, though the Ivorians would rightly claim they worked for their win. They created far better decent chances… and plenty of them. Nicolas Pepe twice hit the crossbar, the France-based midfielder unlucky to walk away without a goal. The Ivorians were more adventurous as they forced a fine save out of Ronwen Williams. Bafana? Well, nothing of consequence, except for Thulani Hlatshwayo, who sent a header inches wide in the opening half. With the early nerves out of the way, Bafana appeared to have settled well into the game… or so they thought. On the other hand, the Elephants intensified pressure, and could have scored more than the solitary goal from Jonathan Kotjia in the 65th minute. The centre forward got himself at the end of a fine cross and slipped the ball past Williams for the opener. Ivory Coast now sit jointly with Morocco at the top of group D with three points. Where to from here for Baxter’s team? Well, they remain in Cairo for their next match against Namibia on Friday. But the next four days will be crucial as they could determine whether they remain in the tournament or prepare to check out of their hotel. Anything other than victory against the neighbours will seal their fate.
