THE people of Ekuphumleni in Browns Farm, Cape Town, have been living without electricity for the past two months. They claimed no one told them why the power was cut off. Patrick Fana (46) said crime is high in the area because there are no lights. “We don’t know what to do anymore because we’ve been reporting the matter to the municipality, but nothing happened,” he said. “At first we thought the problem would soon be resolved, but we are still waiting.” Patrick said they were forced to throw away food because their appliances were not working. “The power cuts started on 29 April. Even if we get electricity back, we won’t have street lights because thugs stole the cables.” Phindile Maxiti, a member of the mayoral committee for energy, said the municipality was making every effort to supply power to the area. But illegal connections made in the nearby Ramaphosa squatter camp made it difficult. “Residents of the informal settlement have been tapping illegally into the existing power network, be it from overheard lines, underground cables, public light poles or distribution kiosks. This is putting pressure on the power system.”
