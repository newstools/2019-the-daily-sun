IN A CASE OF human trafficking in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga, a 30-year-old woman was lucky to escape on 31 May. The 33-year-old man suspected of being behind the incident appeared in the Witbank Magistrates Court on 6 June. Captain Dineo Sekgotodi said the victim was recruited by a woman from her home country of Lesotho. “She allegedly arrived in eMalahleni on 29 May after being recruited with the promise of a job.” She was apparently picked up at the taxi rank by the suspect and taken to a house. “She was allegedly kept against her will, forced to take drugs, raped multiple times and trained by other girls before she was released to pose as a prostitute.” She apparently escaped while the suspect went shopping and told her story to residents, who went with her to the police station. There a case was opened. The suspect was bust. He appeared in court and is due back next week.
