It seems like travelers have to change their packing habits as O.R Tambo has banned Irregular and duffel bags since 25 March 2019. New rules for checking in bags of irregular shape and size have came into effect at Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport. According to Traveller24, the new rules are aimed at preventing blockages and breakdowns in the baggage handling system caused by bags that do not have any flat surfaces or that have long straps or grips as per the International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines. Passengers with "irregular" bags, will be offered the option of having their baggage wrapped to give it a flat side at approved wrapping stations. The new rules have been agreed to after extensive consultations with the Airline Operators Committee (AOC) and other bodies representing airlines. 1.    Only regular-shaped bags will be allowed at check-in counters;2.    This means that the bags must have at least one flat surface to be accepted on the check-in system;3.    Round or irregular-shaped bags will not be allowed at check-in counters; and4.    Bags with longs straps will not be allowed at check-in counters.
