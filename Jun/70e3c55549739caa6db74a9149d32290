Riaan Badenhorst, general manager of Kaspersky Lab Africa, said while it is fascinating to be on these sites and not easy to live without,, young people should be aware of the dangers of the internet. “The allure of engaging and chatting with people that you’d potentially never meet in person can also lead you to have a false sense of security, or to feel there are no risks involved.” Here are some tips to become cyber alert: , Communicate with people you know or whose identity you can verify. Cyberbullies and cybercriminals are always trolling on the Internet, looking for someone to exploit. , Be careful and very selective about what personal information you share online., Look out for online ‘sales’ gimmicks and scams. A popular ploy used by cybercriminals is to promote an online sale and within a specific online community forum, game or in app advertisement.

These scams can also be used as a way in infect your device with malware which could provide cybercriminals with access to your device – and therefore access to your pictures, messages and information. Badenhorst said while we all want friends we can talk to, laugh with or share interesting stories, you still have to be proactive about managing your profile and guard what information you share online to protect yourself. – and that you can be content that your online friendships are genuine and free from cyberbullying or criminal influences.
