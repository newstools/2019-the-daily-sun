THERE was drama at KZN provincial legislature when Economic
Freedom Fighters and Democratic  Alliance members walked out of the
chamber in protest of former president  Jacob Zuma's presence. Premier Sihle Zikalala was to rise and start delivering his
first state of the province address when DA chief whip Francois Rogers rose up
with a point of order to question the presence of non members of the house
sitting in the house. Non members who were in the house included Zuma, his
wife, former, king Goodwill Zwelithini,premier Willies Mchunu and former deputy
speaker Meshack Hadebe and couple of bodyguards. When Speaker Nontembeko Boyce dismisses Rogers'point EFF
leader Vusi Khoza rose up to support him. Khoza said it was against the house
rule to allow the non members to enter if they will contribute anything. After
speaker ruled that the guests won't leave EFF and DA members left the chamber. DA leader Zwakele Mncwango blamed ANC factionalism for the
chaos. He said in terms of the rule the speaker must inform members of the
house if there will be guests in the house otherwise all guests must sit in the
galery not in the house. EFF's Khoza said other rule said the chief whip of the
ruling party must consult  with other  parties' whips about any
guests that will enter the chamber but never happened.
