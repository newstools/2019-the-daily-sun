Former SARS commissioner Tom Moyane has denied tweeting
about clearing his name against ''systematic lies told by dedicated media
houses & journalists". A tweet posted with the handle @MoyaneTom, which claimed to
"share and clear most of the lies", had been gaining traction on
Twitter on Thursday morning, ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the
Nation Address. By 14:25 on Thursday afternoon, the account had over 700
followers, with the tweet liked nearly 300 times, and retweeted over 100 times. The account, meanwhile, is so far following just one
person. Moyane, for his part, has denied that the account belongs to
him. He told Fin24 by phone that he has "never had a Twitter
account". Many Twitter users were
looking to have Moyane confirm that it indeed was him that was behind the
account, with some requesting him to record a live video to confirm that it was
indeed him - much like former president Jacob Zuma did when he joined Twitter
in December 2018.
