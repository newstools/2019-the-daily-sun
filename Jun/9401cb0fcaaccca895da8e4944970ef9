KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu denied his department prioritised graduates who studied through the Funza Lushaka bursary programme. Mshengu was responding to a public outcry that when it came to the employment of teachers, the department prioritised bursary beneficiaries. He said as much as the programme assisted students who could not afford to pay for their studies, they could not overlook graduates whose parents had used their hard-earned money to fund their studies. “In a way it defeats logic that a widow who sold her last cow to pay for her child’s education is disadvantaged on the basis of her child not being the recipient of a bursary. “Getting a bursary is an advantage on its own. It therefore does not help that those who did not have the good fortune to receive a bursary are further disadvantaged.” Mshengu said the department believed in equal employment opportunity and did not discriminate based on age, race, sex, religion or disability. “Recruitment of teachers will not depend on whether they have obtained their academic qualifications through the Fundza Lushaka bursary or not,” said Mshengu.
