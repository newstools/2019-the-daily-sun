President Cyril Ramaphosa said government is recruiting more cops to ensure Mzansi people feel safe in their country. He said this
during his SONA speech in Parliament on Thursday night. This will be done by
increasing the number of cops per each intake. “The South Africa we want is a
country where all people are safe and feel safe.Let us therefore work together
to ensure that violent crime is at least halved over the next decade,” said the President. He said visibility of
cops on the streets and the corporation of police and the communities and
policing forums will ensure active role by citizens to create safe environment. “Currently, there are over 5,000 students registered for basic training in our
police training colleges and we envisage that this number will be increased to
7,000 per cycle over the next two intakes,” 
said Ramaphosa. He said the government is currently working on improving
the success rate of investigations and proffesionalisation throughout the
justice system. The President said the issue of crime will not only be
addressed by cops but needs a holistic approach by every citizen. “Violent
crime is a societal problem that requires a society-wide response. We are working with civil society organisations on
strategies to end gender-based violence and femicide,” said Ramaphosa. The
government is working on the establishment of the Gender Based Violence and
Femicide Council and a National Strategic Plan that will guide efforts to
“eradicate this national scourge” of violence and crime. “We are capacitating
and equipping the police and court system to support survivors of gender-based
violence. We are stepping up the fight against drug syndicates through the
implementation of the National Anti-Gang Strategy and the revised National Drug
Master Plan,”  added Ramaphosa.
