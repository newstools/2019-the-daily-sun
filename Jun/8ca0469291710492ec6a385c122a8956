WHEN a concerned neighbour peeped through his gate after hearing noises outside, little did he know it would lead to his death. Jaquim Ussaca (48), from Amaoti, north of Durban, was shot dead by two men who were robbing his neighbour yesterday morning. The thugs had just robbed a woman of her cellphones. They shot Jaquim when they saw him peeping through his gate. His brother-in-law, Emmanuel Makukule (23), said Jaquim was woken by the noise of his neighbour screaming for help. He said they didn’t steal anything from Jaquim’s house so they probably killed him because he had witnessed the robbery. “He wasn’t alone in the house when this happened. My sister was sleeping and she was woken by the gunshot. He was shot in the head once and died on the scene,” said Emmanuel. He said the woman who was robbed didn’t recognise any of the men. “She told me they broke her door and asked for cellphones and money,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said cops were investigating murder and robbery charges. “Two unknown suspects accosted a woman at home and robbed her of cellphones. A 48-year-old neighbour who went to check after hearing screams was shot in the head,” said Mbele.
