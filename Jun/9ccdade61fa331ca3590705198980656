Luis Enrique has been forced to quit as Spain coach because of a serious family problem. The head of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) Luis Rubiales announced the permanent change on Wednesday. Enrique missed the game against Malta in March and matches against San Marino and Sweden this month. His number two Robert Moreno stepped in and he will keep the job on a permanent basis. Enrique said: 'Because the reasons that prevented me from developing normally my duties as a coach since last March continue to this day, I have decided to leave that position. 'All my thanks to those responsible for the RFEF for the trust and understanding shown. Special thanks to all the people who are part of the staff and the players for their professionalism. 'Without forgetting the media for your discretion and respect for the situation.' Spain's sports media have respected his request for privacy since he announced he would be temporarily stepping down in March although there has been some speculation that the health of one of the former Barcelona's coach's family members is behind his decision.
