THE State of the Nation address on Thursday, 20 June should go off without a hitch. This is according to the presiding officers when they briefed the media about the readiness at parliament yesterday afternoon. The briefing was attended by Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise, deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli, chairman of the National Council of Provinces Amos Masondo and his deputy Sylvia Lucas. “The preparations are at an advanced stage,” said Tsenoli. Modise said: “We have not been given any indication of any disruption. We will stick to what we usually do. If anything unusual happens we go back to our rules.” When asked how many white shirt bouncers parliament had organised, Modise said she didn’t know the number. “I hope we are not going to use any because as I said, we want to rely on the rules and procedures.” Parliament has budgeted R2 million for the address but the presiding officers are hopeful that the amount will be less. “We have that budget but that doesn’t mean we must use it. I’m hoping it goes below the R2 million mark,” she said. Tsenoli said 1 200 guests of various categories will attend. “This includes former presidents, deputy presidents, presiding officers and chief justices. “Other invited guests are veterans of the liberation struggle, surviving Rivonia triallists Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg and giants of the 1956 Women’s March, Gertrude Shope and Sophie de Bruyn.”
