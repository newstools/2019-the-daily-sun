Music runs in Rethabile Khumalo’s blood. Growing up in the shadow of her famous mum Winnie Khumalo did not stop her. Instead, the 24-year-old Retha, as she’s known by her supporters and loved ones, has paved the way for herself in the entertainment industry. The Soweto-born entertainer is an experienced dancer, multi-instrumentalist and singer. Her debut single Nomathemba was released through DJ Tira’s Afrotainment stable. She said: “The message behind this song was inspired by my actual life experience. “People thought I would be like Nomathemba and just sit round and let other people do things for me but I work hard for my dreams and goals.” Retha said she knows the industry is tough but she is positive one day she will find her niche. “I work hard for everything I want and I am not where I want to be but am hopeful I will get there. “My music career was inspired by the likes of Brenda Fassie and Lebo Mathosa. “Those women were original and did not want to be dictated to on how they presented themselves to the world. “They also did not allow American pop culture to influence them,” she said. The Idols SA 2012 contestant said her next project, an EP with seven songs, is already in the works. “I have been in studio recording new music and as soon as I am happy with all the songs, I will release it. “I am going to represent all the genres that are close to my heart like jazz, amapiano, Afro soul and gqom.” She said most people didn’t know she could play piano very well, as well as accoustic and double bass guitar. “I studied music at the National School of the Arts. When people see my videos online, they think I’m just a girl who likes to play a guitar. “But I am passionate about playing instruments. “I also get booked to play for other artists,” Retha said.
