SRC president Sesiyanda Godlimpi said his suspension has affected his studies. He was served with a suspension letter last week by the Durban University of Technology after he allegedly verbally attacked a staff member. The letter reads: “You are prohibited from participating in any student academic and non-academic activities pending the investigation of a serious misconduct of verbal and physical threats to a staff member and for instilling fear and intimidation within the working environment.” Godlimpi told Daily Sun after he received the letter, he wrote to the university and asked to be allowed to write his exams. “I was then allowed to go on campus to write my exam but I was told to leave immediately afterwards. “It’s not easy because I’m not allowed to use facilities such as the library so it’s hard to prepare for my exams.” Godlimpi said he was still waiting for the university to tell him when a hearing will be held to discuss the allegations. Jimmy Nkambule, Economic Freedom Fighters student command chairman, said Godlimpi was being punished for fighting for students who were still not registered. University spokesman Alan Khan said Godlimpi was placed on precautionary suspension. “He’s expected to make representation on why the suspension should not be substantive. This suspension was due to his recent conduct, which was in breach of the university’s disciplinary code,” said Khan. He said the university had no choice but to take action against him as he was accused of violating the disciplinary code. “This matter is still sub judice and the university won’t comment further until all the due processes have been concluded.”
