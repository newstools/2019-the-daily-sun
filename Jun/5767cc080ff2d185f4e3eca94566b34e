MZANSI has been experiencing harsh weather conditions such as floods and drought, symptoms of the destruction of the environment and climate change. As the world celebrated International Day for Biological Diversity on 22 May, Maphumulo Municipality joined in to raise awareness. The municipality celebrated the day with the theme: ‘Our biodiversity, our food, our health.” This was the idea of the municipality’s environmental officer Thandeka Thusi. She said they visited three local schools, Nyamazane, Balcombs and Otimati primary schools to teach pupils about the importance of saving the planet. She said she hoped to instil awareness in pupils and make them aware of the consequences of their actions. “Maphumulo is situated in a rural area and many residents use wood to make fires and herbs from the forest. “They do so without re-growing the forest and this influences change in the climate,which causes disasters such as floods and droughts later on,” she said. A grade three pupil from Nyamazane Primary School, Ayanda Mthethwa, said: “I am going to tell my mother everything that I learnt today because she also cuts fire wood from the forest to cook our food.”
