WITH the juniors finals done and dusted, the popular Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) Games moves to the Seniors and Masters category. The draw for both categories will be conducted in Alexandra today, with as many as 32 teams pitted against each other to determine who goes through to the keenly-awaited round of 16. Among the names in the pot are Zulu Aces, Bubi Stars, Polokwane City Rovers, Nongoma United, Nobuhle United and Lebash Academy. “The pre-rounds were exciting. Already we have a hat-trick scorer. But as you’d know, no winner has ever defended their title,” said organising committee member Percy Ndaba. It’ll be interesting to see whether the Soweto Super United can become the first team to defend their cup. “We’ve also seen as many as 24 goals scored over the weekend. But we are hoping for a goal-fest with more matches being played in this round.” As it has been over the last 18 years, the turnout for the 19th edition has been great, with residents and football enthusiasts from as far as Limpopo flooding the Rotary ground to have a taste of the “kasi flavour” football. Scouts have also been keeping a watchful eye on untapped talent, eager to recruit players for the professional clubs. The huge numbers have been making for a great spectacle, also adding to the booming business on the sidelines.But the organisers derive much joy from the growing popularity of the annual winter games. “Despite the challenges, the Games are growing. We are grateful to the sponsors who have continued to back us in these tough economic times,” added Ndaba. “We are hoping to maintain the standards and achieve the goals we have set ourselves this year.” The draw for the Masters will feature 16 teams.Even though they are not as big as the Seniors in terms of prestige, the Masters games are a great source of excitement for those willing to turn back the clock to the good old days.
