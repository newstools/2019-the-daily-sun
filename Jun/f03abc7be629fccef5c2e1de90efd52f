FAMILY and friends of the two men shot and killed in Samora Machel kasi gathered to celebrate their lives at a memorial service. The school hall at Nal’uxulo Primary School in Philippi, Cape Town, was packed with residents singing and dancing. Active community members, Sivuyile Gqobhoza and Siphiwo Khabiqheya, were ambushed by four men while sitting at the Tsoga Community Centre last Monday. Sivuyile was a CPF member while Siphiwo was known for collecting school uniforms for poor kids in the area. Siphosethu Peter, who is pregnant with Sivuyile’s child, said: “I’m sad. I wanted us to raise our child together but a heartless person decided to take his life,” she said. Community leader Xolani Swaartbooi said: “Siphiwo would knock on every door to ensure kids in the community would get what they needed for school,” he said. Xolani said the two were always together and were true friends.
