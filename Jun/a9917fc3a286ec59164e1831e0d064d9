GERMANY has made it two wins out of two at the Women's World Cup as they claimed a narrow win over Spain in Group B on Wednesday night. Bayern Munich midfielder Sara Daebritz's scrappy first-half goal was enough for Germany to secure maximum points and edge closer on qualifying for knockout stages of the tournament. It was a same scenario as the weekend when Spain defeated Banyana Banyana 3-1, they dominated possession but the Germans scored against the run of play when Daebritz pounced on some hesitant defending to put the ball at the far post. The result now puts Banyana under immense pressure ahead of their clash against China PR at the Parc des Princes on Thursday night. Banyana need a victory at all costs to keep their hopes of making it to the next round alive as a defeat will mean Germany are through to the next round and SA is good as out of the competition. Germany are at the top of Group B with 6 points followed by Spain with three, both have payed two mathes. China are third without a point same as Banyana who are at the bottom of the Group. Two-time winners Germany - who opened with a 1-0 win over China have reached at least the quarterfinals in all of the previous seven World Cups. Germans remain unbeaten in 14 games since March 2018, while they are yet to lose to Spain after five meetings.
