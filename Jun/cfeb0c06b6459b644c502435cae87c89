PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa says the young people must focus on their future and not loose hope as the challenges will soon be addressed. He said although there are many challenges young people are faced with, some delay their future by focusing on things like substance abuse which contributes more in violence. Ramaphosa was addressing the citizens of South Africa during the Youth day commemoration held in Polokwane, Limpopo on Sunday. "We are saying don't lose hope, don't let the sun set on your plans and dreams. Taking advantage the opportunities you are keeping the legacy of activism alive. These are for the benefits of future generation. This country is yours to inherit, and your are the greatest asserts of this country," he said. He promised that if the young people focus on the opportunities they will never be better than their parents who passed through struggles fighting the former regime. He stated that the current government is willing to listen to young people's views while they continue to be aware of the challenges they have. "We are going to continue to put the interests of young people ahead. We do both celebration while very much aware that there are challenges we have to address. We will make sure that what you want becomes a reality," says Ramaphosa.
