PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his second State of the Nation Address in parliament today. Daily Sun asked readers what they would like the president to talk about.  “We need the president to tell us how he is going to help us get jobs because we are suffering.” She said she had been unemployed for more than three years after the company she had worked for closed down. “Many companies are closing down almost every day, which leads to job losses.”  “I’ve been sending CVs almost everywhere, but there are no jobs. We need government to help us with that,” she said.  “I looked for work but couldn’t find it. Instead of sitting at home, I started a small business selling fruit, but I’m still harassed by Metro cops,” he said. “They often take my stock, claiming I’m selling it illegally. If they take my things, what am I supposed to do? Steal and be a criminal?”  “We need skills for young people because we are nothing without skills,” he said.
