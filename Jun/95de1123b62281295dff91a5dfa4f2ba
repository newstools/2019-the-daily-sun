WITH no jobs available many young people turn to entrepreneurship. But do you know how to run a business? Do you know how to sell your business idea and get funding for it? The Engen Pitch & Polish is the platform you need to launch yourself on to the path of success. Celebrating its tenth anniversary of turning ideas into successful business, this competition is a nationwide entrepreneurial workshop and competition programme that – so far – has helped over 10 000 entrepreneurs improve the way they pitch their businesses to potential investors. As all entrepreneurs know, a perfectly polished pitch is one of the keys to growing and succeeding in business. The 10 year edition of the programme is hosted in partnership with Engen Petroleum, Nedbank and Raizcorp. This year the programme kicks off in Joburg on 6 July. You can register as a delegate to attend the workshop or – if you feel you have what it takes – you can complete an online entry form to become a contestant. During one fun, exciting and free day, all participants undergo tight and interactive entrepreneurial training on how to pitch like a pro! The session is facilitated by Justin Cohen, best-selling author, international speaker and TV talk-show host. After the training session, contestants then pitch their ideas or businesses to the whole audience. This get really interesting here as both Justin and the audience give feedback on how pitches can be improved. The regional winners of each leg will have the opportunity to be crowned the ultimate pitch champion at the final glittering round of the competition held in Johannesburg later this year.
