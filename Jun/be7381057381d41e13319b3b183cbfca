MZANSI has once again been ranked as a violent country in which to live. According to the Global Peace Index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace last month, the country had worsened since 2017. The index ranked 163 countries according to their level of peacefulness. It covered 99,7% of the world’s population. It found 92 countries worsened and 71 improved, meaning the global level of peace went down by 0,27%. The index measured the state of peace based on safety and security, local and international conflict and the degree of militarisation. Internal conflicts were stated as the biggest causes of improvement or decline as they were linked to the strength of a country’s economy. The institution said low levels of corruption, acceptance of the rights of others and a well-functioning government were the key pillars of peaceful states. South Africa has been dealing with a range of violent crimes, including violence against women, as well as high levels of corruption. “The economic impact of violence increased by 2% during 2017 due to a rise in conflict and increases in internal security spending, with the largest increases being in China, Russia and South Africa.”
