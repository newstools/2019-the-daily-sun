THE sangoma does not only throw bones. It seems his mission is to also throw people out of their homes! Victims confirmed that a syndicate of four people including the sangoma are hijacking houses in Buhle Park, Ekurhuleni. Three people have already fallen victim to the syndicate. One of the victims, Thandi Sangweni (48), said the sangoma came to her house and made a prediction. “He told me my house had demons. He then told me to sell it for R270 000.” Thandi said the sangoma also gave her muthi to drink. “The buyer and her lawyer came and they made me sign papers.” She said the money was deposited into her bank account and the sangoma told her to withdraw it. “I withdrew R210 000 and R60 000 at two specific banks in two days. “The sangoma then demanded the money be brought to him so he could ‘wash it’. “I went to collect the washed cash as per instruction , but he was gone. He disappeared with the money.” She opened a case of fraud at Elsburg Police Station. Thandi is now squatting in her house with the new buyer, who wants her out. She said she’s heartbroken and even tried to commit suicide . “Everything happened so fast. I was not myself after the sangoma gave me muthi. Khethukuhle Hlongwane (45) said her sister Lindiwe Sizani was robbed in the same manner. Her sister’s house was bought for R245 000. Local Sanco leader David Mashiyane said there’s a third case, but the victim had since left the area. “We are busy with the cases because the victims were not of sound mind.” Reuben Mashoeshoe of Mashoeshoe Attorneys said the contract can be set aside. Ekurhuleni West cop spokesman Captain Lesetja Mathobela said a case of fraud was opened and cops were looking for the suspects.
