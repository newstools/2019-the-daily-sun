 A 32-year-old man accused of theft was doused with petrol
and set alight by residents in Parkgate, In KwaZulu Natal. RUSA spokesperson, Prem Balram said members of Reaction Unit
South Africa were called out to a property at Tottenham Road after the
critically injured man collapsed on the driveway. "The caller confirmed that the individual had suffered
extensive burns to more than 90% of his body," said Balram. Balram said upon arrival, the man confirmed that he had a
stolen a grass cutting machine from contractors who were working on the
roadside in Parkgate. "They, with assistance from the community pursued and
apprehended the thief at the Ottawa intersection," he said. "They then led him to a bush in the area where they
assaulted him with hammers and stabbed him before he was doused with petrol and
set alight," he added. Balram said the men then drove off in a white Toyota Hilux
bakkie and left him for dead in the bush. The injured man managed to walk to a nearby home and
collapsed on the driveway. "The Parkgate resident also confirmed that he was arrested
previously after he stole a laptop in Central Durban," said Balram. He is currently being transported by ambulance to a provincial
hospital in a critical condition.
