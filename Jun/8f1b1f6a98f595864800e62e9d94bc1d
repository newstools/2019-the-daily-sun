THIS
coming Sunday it’s Father’s Day – a day to celebrate those fathers, who haven’t
abdicated their responsibilities to care and look after the children they help
bring into this world. Showbiz
has some yummy dads, who enjoy fatherhood as much as they enjoy entertaining
us. So, in the of Father’s Day we bring some yummy famous dads that make
fatherhood look like a walk in the park. Actor
Joe Kazadi recently welcomed a baby girl and since then he has been a hands-on
dad. Of course, his well-toned body that he always flaunts helps him in his
fatherhood duties.  The actor enjoys
spending time with his little princess, which makes him a tad bit sexier. Still
on yummy daddies, who can forget veteran actor Hlomla Dandala, who is aging
like fine wine. From the days of Isidingo when he had dreadlocks and now on
1Magic’s hit telenovela The River, there’s one thing for sure Hlomla is still a
gorgeous doting dad. Instead of growing old like other men, his yumminess just
gets better. There is one other thing we love about Hloms is that he absolutely
adores his children. There
is absolutely no ways we can talk about yummy daddies and omit actor Thapelo
Mokoena’s name.  He is comfortably in his
early 40s and Thapelo looks edible.  He
was once a skinny TV presenter and suddenly he is a dad – and a cute one at
that. He loves his two children, which is important. SO THIS CHILD AS NO RESPECT FOR ME HAS HER FATHER  SHE JUST FART AND I SEAT THERE WAITING FOR AN APOLOGY AND NOTHING!!! ????????????????????????????????????????????
