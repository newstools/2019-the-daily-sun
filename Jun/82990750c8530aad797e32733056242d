AFTER gogo Miriam Makgoro’s house burned down last month, it was the worst pain she’d ever felt. The 79-year-old lost everything including her ID, her granddaughter’s ID and three of her younger grandchildren’s birth certificates. Daily Sun published gogo’s story on 22 May with the headline “Flames swallow gogo’s house”. Gogo Miriam has now complained that Home Affairs officials have failed to help her. She said they expected her to pay money which she didn’t have. Gogo Miriam from Senotlelo, near Vaalbank in Mpumalanga, said she urgently needed to fix her house but couldn’t apply for a loan without an ID. “My hands are tied because I cannot fix my burnt house. My neighbours will soon get tired of giving us shelter.” Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane said the family should contact provincial manager Doris Chiloane. He said Chiloane can be contacted on 060 970 9854.
