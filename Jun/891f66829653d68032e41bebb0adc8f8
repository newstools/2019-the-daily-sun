MRS SA semi-finalist Dilwana Magoro said people who read cannot fail to build a better nation. The 34-year-old model from Ga-Matlala outside Polokwane in Limpopo would like to see Mzansi’s standard of education improving. On Saturday, Dilwana held a book drive in Polokwane called Reading with Dilwana to collect books for schools. She told Daily Sun a lazy society will never progress but will only produce criminals. “Education is a tool we need to use to sharpen our minds for a better future.” She said the donation of books will not only help pupils but the whole community. The books will be distributed to school libraries to help pupils in her village. “This drive will also see many schools across the province benefiting. I’m also trying to create a culture of reading for people who don’t have libraries around them.” “We have to improve our standard of education for better results.” Dilwana said it was important that education becomes popular with children. “Doing so, we will produce stars and great leaders.” She said children should be encouraged to read from a young age. “Reading gives you knowledge to easily become a leader. A reading mind remains young and fresh.” She said it worried her that Mzansi’s youth has shifted their focus onto drugs and booze. “Ignoring this will be nursing a lost nation.” Dilwana said the street lifestyle is killing Mzansi’s future. “We need to be a nation which believes in reading and education.”
