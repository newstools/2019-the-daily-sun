WHEN residents got construction jobs in December, they were happy with the payment agreement. But according to employees of Cranbrook Building Construction in Mokopane Extension, Limpopo, they were not getting the R130 a day they were promised. Yesterday, more than 20 workers marched to the Cranbrook site offices, demanding sub-contractor Donald Phele be removed from the building project. March leader Doctor Mashimbye (41) said Phele was underpaying workers and didn’t show them respect. The workers’ memorandum was received and signed by the company’s Michael Mildenhall, who promised to respond within seven days. Phele said employees were demanding a wage increase. He said they came with a union representative on Monday and returned the next day after negotiations. He said most employees were not on strike. “The people who marched worked here before but were dismissed because of poor behaviour,” he said. “They’re using a few of my employees to attack me because some of them wanted to be hired as sub-contractors. “I got this job because the main contractor knows I will deliver.”
