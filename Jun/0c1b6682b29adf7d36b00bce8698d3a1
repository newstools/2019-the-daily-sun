WHEN Sho Madjozi was announced as the winner of Newcomer of the Year and Female Artist of the Year awards at the Samas on Saturday night, her aunt Linah Maluleke (62) and cousin went crazy! Linah from Shirley Village Elim in Limpopo, said the family sat together in her house so they could celebrate if she won. “I was sitting on the couch. I jumped off and started shouting with joy,” Linah told Daily Sun. “It was a big day for us. She was representing the family, the village and Limpopo.” She said Sho Madjozi always loved music. “She would sing and play with drums on tins. She went to Polokwane with her dad when she was 10, and that’s when her love of music really came to life.” Sho Madjozi has released a music video for the hit single, Idhomo.  It was recently filmed in her village. “I decided to shoot the video here because I always wanted to do something for the villagers. The support and love that they gave me is amazing,” she said. Sho Madjozi said she was honoured to win both awards. Her cousin, Thami Maluleke (27), who plays for NFD team TS Sporting, said: “Her victory at the Samas has inspired me to push hard to achieve my dreams.”
