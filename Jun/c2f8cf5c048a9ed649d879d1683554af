Zodwa Wabantu is at it again and she nearly caused a stampede at Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha over the weekend! The newly engaged entertainer and reality tv star  had students drooling over her and they could not help but fight to get on stage during the Fresher’s bash. Security guards had their hands full but had the situation handled and luckily no one was reported harmed during the event . Zodwa handled the situation like a pro, after all, she is used to having men trying to get on stage while she performs. She was apparently late on stage, which got the students impatient! However the show carrried on and Zodwa shook what her Mama gave her. Sengikhona?????????? Makunyiwa Makunyiwe???? They were Angry?? Shouting Where is Zodwa Wabantu, I had to Tell them,I'm here....??
