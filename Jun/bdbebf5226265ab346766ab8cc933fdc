THE days of rubbish and dead animals in Nelson Mandela Bay’s streets are over. Mayor Mongameli Bobani launched the waste management community project yesterday. Speaking at Nangoza Jebe Hall in New Brighton, Bobani said: “Over 40 co-operatives have been appointed to help clean the city. This will add to the work done by municipal waste management. “The co-operatives will help the municipality in areas that are difficult to access with waste collection vehicles. They will also assist with awareness programmes.” He said over R40 million was budgeted for the project this year. Mandla Shabangu of environmental affairs said they visited the metro to teach residents about a clean environment. “We taught them waste and water management, landscaping and tree planting. We will also visit schools and teach kids how to keep the environment clean.” Ward 19 councillor Gamelihle Maqula told Daily Sun: “This is going to help our wards become clean and healthy.” Ncumisa Faku from Motherwell is part of one co-operative. She said: “I’m excited the project finally worked after mayors came and went. “This will create jobs for us.”
