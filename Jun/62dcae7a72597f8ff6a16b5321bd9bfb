ORPHANS were happy when soldiers donated food parcels to their home on Wednesday. Sergeant Steve Ngcobo told Daily Sun they wanted to help kids at Zanokhanyo Orphanage in Khayelitsha, Cape Town and to bring the military close to the community. “People must not be afraid of soldiers. We do these projects because we want to be close to the residents,” he said. The soldiers started visiting the orphanage for Mandela Day back in 2014. Ngcobo said they paid for the donations from their own pockets. “We asked our members to bring anything they could afford,” he said. Ngcobo said the soldiers planned to do more for the kids in the future. “We know they need every bit of help they can get,” he said. Orphanage founder Nolubabalo Ndita couldn’t believe her eyes when the soldiers arrived. “I was surprised to see them because they usually visit us on Mandela Day,” she said. Nolubabalo said they had been struggling ever since parts of the home were burned by thugs in November. “We hope one day someone will build a new structure for us because we really need it.” She thanked the soldiers for putting the kids first. “We are grateful to the soldiers because they could have chosen any other orphanage, but they chose us. We hope God will protect them for us and keep them safe all the time,” said Nolubalo. The orphanage cares for 22 people, ranging from babies to young people aged 22. Sizwe Ncube, who had been living at the home for seven years, said he was very happy with the donation.
