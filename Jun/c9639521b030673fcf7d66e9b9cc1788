THERE was a BIG reason why Dareen Keet was benched in Bafana Bafana’s Afcon opener against Ivory Coast. Amid all the shock and moaning by South Africans back home, the Scot had answers why Ronwen Williams found himself in the starting line-up on Monday. Keet has been inactive for a while with his PSL club Bidvest Wits having benched him after contractual disagreements. And Williams is a good shot-stopper and has match sharpness, according to the coach. "When we played in Tunisia against Libya, we played with three centre backs and their strength was playing in lots of crosses,” Baxter told reporters after their 1-0 loss to The Elephants of Ivory Coast on Monday "Ronwen was more suited for this game, his shot stopping, and his quick distribution are important. I thought Ronwen did very well." Going to face Namibia in their second Group D Afcon fixture on Friday at 10pm, Bafana are rooted to the bottom of the log without any point, like the Brave Warriors. Victory against Namibia could turn their fortunes around and hope for a draw in their last group match against Morocco on Monday.
