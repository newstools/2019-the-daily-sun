Schools are community’s important assets that must be protected and guarded at all times against any unnecessary destructions or theft. Some criminals see schools as soft targets to break in, especially during holidays. A 26 year old suspect was caught and assaulted by the community this morning at a local primary school in central Kagiso. The Kagiso SAPS spokesman, Solomon Sibiya said the complainant allegedly went to the school to type some documents. “He then received a complaint from a member of the community about the burglary at the school,” said Sibiya. “He rushed to the scene where upon arrival noticed that the store room was broken into and four (4) table legs were missing, a book shelf, sports facilities and lamps. The suspect gained entry by breaking the burglar and door open with unknown object,” he added. Sibiya said the suspect was caught and severely assaulted by the community. He has been handed over to Police who took him to hospital under guard. A case docket of business burglary was registered at Kagiso SAPS and police investigations are continuing.
