THOKO Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said serving as CRL Rights Commission chairwoman was dangerous. Daily Sun has exclusively learnt that Xaluva will no longer lead the commission and has been replaced by her deputy, Luka Mosoma. Xaluva said she did not regret the work she did during her term in office, as religious abuse should be stopped. After being chairwoman since 2013, she was not asked to serve another term. In March, she was among 42 candidates selected for interviews. Former co-operative governance minister Zweli Mkhize called for nominations in September. Mosoma was apparently appointed early this month. Xaluva said: “I don’t know how this was decided, but I’m really grateful to the organisers who took the time and energy to nominate me”. During her five years in office, Xaluva fought with religious leaders while defending the rights of people who were being exploited and abused. “My family will now have a normal life. It was the toughest five years of my life and dangerous. But I didn’t go into it blindly. I knew there would be consequences if you stood up against abuse of power. “I was doing the right thing because it needs to be stopped. I was intimidated but as a leader, you take responsibility and decisions without fear or favour.” She said she would remain committed to ensuring the rights of religious followers were not violated. “I will continue to be involved in the religious and cultural sector. It is my passion. I will commit to those cases already in court,” she said.
