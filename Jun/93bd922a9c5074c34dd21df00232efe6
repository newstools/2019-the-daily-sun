THIS Sunday will be exactly 43 years since the uprising of Soweto students, and 25 of them have been under a democratically elected government. But is there any joy today for those students who laid down their lives for a better education? Some of them are now parents and grandparents witnessing a society where you have to be rich to get a good education. They are seeing the education system deteriorating in front of their eyes. Some of those who were fighting against an evil education system are running the government today but, seemingly, they have forgotten about the townships and poor rural Africans. Education in the townships is so bad that parents prefer to send their children away, even if they have to travel long distances for the better education reserved for the rich. While schools in Soweto and other townships are falling apart, MEC for Education in Gauteng, Panyaza Lesufi, is obsessed with forcing Afrikaans medium schools in the so-called white suburbs to cater for everybody. There is this misconception that the uprising was about doing away with Afrikaans. No. The kids were not fighting against being taught Afrikaans as a school subject, but were against the language being used as the medium of instruction. This is just a distraction for the MEC who is such a favourite with the people that an outcry forced Gauteng Premier David Makhura to retain him in the education portfolio. Under his leadership a few state of the art schools have been established. But more than 25 years into democracy, Soweto schools are as much segregated along language or ethnic lines as they were during apartheid. There has been much integration and demographics have changed dramatically, but it seems the education department has not caught up.
