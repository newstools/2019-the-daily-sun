BONGANI Sibambo aims to make the world accessible for people. The 31-year-old blind man from Mangweni in Nkomazi has left for Kenya to represent the Mpumalanga mini-library for the blind. Bongani left the country on Wednesday to attend the annual Africa Public Service Day continental celebration. It will be held in Nairobi from today until Sunday. The celebration is an African Union event which aims to recognise the value of service to the community. The mini-library provides computer hardware and software specifically designed for blind users. It also has audio playback equipment as well as audio and braille books. Bongani said he’s grateful for the opportunity and believes it will help him learn new things which blind people can use to improve their knowledge. “I feel great and I look forward to learning new things. “This is not about winning an award, but learning and sharing information. “It’s also about inspiring and encouraging people living with a disability to change their mindsets,” said Bongani. Mpumalanga Arts and Culture MEC Lindiwe Ntshalintshali said this is a great platform for Mzansi to show other countries how to improve the lives of people living with disabilities.
