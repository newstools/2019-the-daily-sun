“THE fact that you can smell meat next door and cannot afford it shouldn’t make you envious. You must devise your own means to get your kids fed.” Many would have been reminded of this colourful Steve Komphela quote when the PSL announced the expansion of the MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC). In this instance, the National First Division (NFD) teams resemble the poor father next door envious of the moneyed MDC neighbours. The multi-million sponsorship deal will guarantee increased TV coverage as well as revenue for the MDC. But some feel that the PSL have neglected the starving NFD, who survive on a R500 000 monthly grant. PSL boss Irvin Khoza, however, says that is an unfair assumption. “Nothing in the rules says we must spend money on the NFD. Nothing says we must give grants to the NFD,” said Khoza. “But it’s not an obligation of the PSL.” But he went further to explain the PSL continue to spend millions on the lower league. “It’s a gesture in the spirit of Ubuntu because we also want to improve the product. The NFD know we go the extra mile to assist. Even in the Invitation to Tender (ITT) we include the NFD package, hence the play-offs are shown on TV. “But we can’t force sponsors to sponsor. The NFD have to make sure their league is attractive to broadcasters to televise their games.”
