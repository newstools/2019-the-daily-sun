  THE ruling party is making big promises to the people of
Mzansi over the next five years. Earlier today, ANC secretary general Ace Magashule delivered
the statement on the outcomes of their NEC Lekgotla which was held over the weekend. Magashule said the party claimed to improve the difficult
lives of Africans. “Black people don’t have the privileges that white people
have. We are not treated the same. Things have not changed and we cannot
pretend it is ok and be afraid to say these things because we are the governing
party”, Magashule told journalists yesterday. This ambitious plan included halving the unemployment rate
from 27% to 14% in the next five years. Magashule said: “A new sense of urgency will be injected
into the Thuma Mina programme in the form of Khawuleza (speed up).” He said ministers will no longer be held accountable just
before elections or after five years, but rather annually. “People will be given tasks and if you fail, you can’t blame
us. As head office, we’ll be calling people and say “you are failing”. People
must tell us why they couldn’t do their tasks,” Magashule said. Among the goals set for the next five years is changes to
the current tender system. The secretary general said there will be a gradual phasing
out of the tendering process as they want to do away with it.  He said the centre of power will be the ANC as people vote
for the party and not individuals to parliament. Magashule said their five year plan to reduce poverty and
empower citizens, which included transformation of the economy to serve all,
investing in the capabilities of all the people, strengthening of the social
wage, advance nation-building and social cohesion and a safe South Africa for
all. He said in the spirit of discipline, they were going to call
all members who were tweeting to behave themselves. He also said as the governing party, they support the Public
Protector and all other Chapter Nine institutions.
