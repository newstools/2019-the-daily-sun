THREE years have passed since the CRL Rights Commission banned some illegal schools in Gauteng. But a week after the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs lifted the ban, illegal initiation schools opened in the Vaal, south of Joburg. Traditional Affairs MEC Lebogang Maile said boys had gone missing from their homes and were later rescued from fake initiation schools. This week alone, five boys were rescued from fake initiation schools in Zakariyya Park. Speaking to Daily Sun, Solomon Mofokeng, chairman of the Sedibeng Initiation Traditional Surgeons Committee, said: “If a municipality is ready, initiation chiefs should register with the committee for preparation of their intakes. As of now, we have not received any registrations,” he said. “Instead we got thugs who are ruining this age old tradition by running illegal initiation schools in our areas.” He urged cops to arrest the thugs. According to the office of the MEC, various municipalities were requested to advise on the state of their readiness. Tshwane and the West Rand Municipality confirmed they had systems in place to host customary initiations. Emfuleni is one of those that is not ready and in the past, has experienced a huge number of deaths and kidnappings. “We need land to run these schools. “There are recommendations made by the commission, which includes us having safe land with water. So far, the Vaal has only three pieces of land, which will never be enough for all of us,” said Mofokeng.
