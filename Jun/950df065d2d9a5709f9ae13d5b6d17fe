MEN can now also feel sexy in lace! In May, US company ACED Design released brightly coloured lace outfits for men. Pictures trended on social media of men wearing see-through lace shorts with short sleeved tops. The look was first designed by US rapper Cazwell and seen in his latest music video. The garments are available in pastel pink, blue and green. The underwear is available online. Most SunReaders said on Facebook they weren’t impressed.

I will never wear this nonsense.” Luyanda said: “The slay men, watching SAMA25 while the real men were watching UEFA Champs League, will probably buy those shorts.” Nceba said: “Give me one.” Matshidiso said: “Real men will wear that to show off what they’ve got.”
