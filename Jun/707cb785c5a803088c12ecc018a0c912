THRONGS of residents, including high school pupils, marched to the local magistrates court to express their displeasure over the possible granting of bail to a man accused of rape. The 27-year-old man, who cannot be named as he has not yet pleaded, is accused of attempting to rape a grade 12 pupil at Khanyisa High School in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, over a week ago. He appeared in the Mthatha Magistrates Court yesterday on charges of attempted murder, attempted rape and assault. It is alleged he tried to rape the pupil after asking her to accompany him to a taxi stop. He stabbed her and left her bleeding. He was arrested on Sunday. The case was postponed to 1 July for a formal bail application. The state opposed his release on bail to verify his profile. Outside court, the girl’s mum said she was disappointed as she had trusted the accused. “We supported him and his girlfriend. But he threw everything back in my face,” said the mum. Principal Sebastian Vettakunel said the pupil should have been attending winter classes. “We will continue to support her. Justice groups and the police need to ensure the rights of children are protected,” he said.
