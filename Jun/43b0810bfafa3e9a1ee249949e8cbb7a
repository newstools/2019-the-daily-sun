THERE are pupils out there who live many kilometres away from their schools. They walk long distances and often get to school late and tired. But this will be a thing of the past after one company came to their rescue. Twenty five pupils from five schools in Limpopo each received a bicycle. Lulama Dlamini, general manager at Heha Trading, told the People’s Paper: “We’re trying to shorten the distance needy pupils travel to school by giving them bicycles.” The company has been running a transport business support programme on behalf of the Transport Education Training Authority. Beneficiary and matric Ntwanano Khubayi (17) said: “We start school early and knock off late, so the bicycle will help me get to school and home on time. The Giyani Secondary School pupil said she was very grateful to Heha because she walks long distances every day. Principal Nyikiwa Rikhotso said: “We’re pleased that our pupils are also part of those who received the bicycles. “A burden has been lifted from their shoulders. “We hope the schools will ensure the pupils are given tips on how they can be safe on the road when riding.” Each bicycle comes with a safety helmet, pump and repair kit.
