IT SEEMS he didn’t learn from his mistake as he’s back behind bars! This was after he was released from jail on parole after he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for killing his then girlfriend. But he allegedly committed the same crime just two months after he was released. He tried to escape but cops bust him. He was charged with murder again and is expected to appear in court today. The 38-year-old man allegedly assaulted his lover, who was rushed to hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. A case of murder was then opened at the KwaMakhutha Police Station. After hearing his girlfriend had died, the suspect fled the area. Cops searched and finally arrested him. He was hiding in Jeppestown in Joburg. According to police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala, the suspect fled the area after the incident and went into hiding. She said an intensive investigation was conducted, which led to his arrest. “He was brought back to KwaMakhutha Police Station. He was charged with murder and will appear in the Nsimbini Magistrates Court today,” said Gwala. She confirmed he was released on parole two months ago. “In April 2013 he was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for the murder of his then girlfriend, Nomfundo Mthembu, who he fatally assaulted in June 2012.”
