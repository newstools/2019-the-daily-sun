HE usually read dockets and decided people’s fates. But the district public prosecutor from the Joburg Family Court stood in the dock waiting his turn. This was after the 44-year-old was bust on Tuesday for alleged corruption and extortion. He was bust by the Gauteng police anti-corruption unit after allegedly requesting R10 000 to make someone’s case disappear. The victim said he received a call from a man who identified himself as the prosecutor dealing with his case. He said the caller told him he’d cancel his case if he was given R10 000. The victim reported the matter and cops pounced on the prosecutor at the Joburg Family Court after he accepted R5 000 from the man. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed to Daily Sun that police nabbed the prosecutor after he allegedly accepted the money. The suspect appeared in the Joburg Magistrates Court yesterday. NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwana said the prosecutor was denied bail. “He remains in custody and will appear in court again in July for a formal bail application,”
