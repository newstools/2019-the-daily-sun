Hey MizzB I am a 17-year-old girl dating a 35-year-old guy who really makes me happy. We are keeping our relationship a secret from family and friends. The problem is that this guy and I are related. We are wary of how our families would react if they were to find out.What complicates things is that he is engaged to another woman. Hey, Princess You seem to be torn between the man you have feelings for and your family. As a young woman, it is important not to allow yourself to settle for relationships that do not allow you to be yourself. Being in such relationships robs you of better opportunities. Love yourself.
