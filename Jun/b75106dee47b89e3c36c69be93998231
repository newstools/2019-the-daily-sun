 The African National Congress finally got around laying
charges crimen injuria and incitement of violence charges against Steve Hofmeyr
on Monday. The ANC had originally planned to lay the charges against
Hofmeyr on Thursday 20 June in Cape Town. The ANC says that it is laid the charges against Hofmeyr for
"his racist and inhumane rants on Social Media which smacks of barbarism,
white supremacy and toxic masculinity." Last week Tuesday, Hofmeyr caused a stir with a now-deleted
tweet which read: "Dear @zilevandamme and @zindziMandela I'm a South
African tax-paying citizen. Effectively, I AM your BOSS. You WILL jump when I
say so and you WILL ask how high. And when you come to take our lives&land,
you WILL die. Our contract is that simple. And don't you forget it" Briefing the media outside the Central Johannesburg Police
Station Mabe said that they postponed opening the case on Thursday in Cape Town
because they wanted to open it at the Joburg Station which is close to their
headquarters where they can get regular updates from the police. Mabe said no matter how people got angry about Zindzi
Mandela's tweet it doesn't warrant them making statements that incite violence. On Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane's deployment. Mabe said that
that's an issue that would have to be sorted out by the Department of
International Relations and Cooperation. "We've got a capable Minister in
Doctor Naledi Pandor," Mabe said.
