MZANSI’s first ever dagga pizza is available to order! According to Business Insider, pizza restaurant Col’Cacchio is introducing a special ingredient as of this week. The pizza franchise has teamed up with Cannabidiol (CBD) oil maker africanpure. CBD is the non-hallucinogenic chemical version of dagga used for medical treatment. So you can munch on your pizza without worrying about the dagga side effects. For an additional R25, you can get three sprays of the CBD on your pizza at a dosage of under 20mg. Business Insider adds that two new pizzas ,Green Goddess and Not-So-Plan Mary Jane ,featuring the special ingredient have been added to the menu. The site reports that the demand for CBD has shot up in Mzansi since the department of Health gave the green light for it to be sold legally in Mzansi. This also is good news for lovers of the holy herb since the private use of dagga was legalised last year.
