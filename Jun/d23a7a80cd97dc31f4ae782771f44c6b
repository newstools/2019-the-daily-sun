HIS riding name is Vindizel, the road captain. Vindizel’s real name is Toto Nompetsheni (41), who agreed to chat to Sunwheels. Toto is from Carletonville in the far West Rand region and he rides a metallic maroon and grey Honda CBR 1000. He said bikers must avoid revving their bikes too much because it damages the engine.
