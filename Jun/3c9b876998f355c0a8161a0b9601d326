RAPPER Ifani, whose real name is Mzayifani Boltina, took a break from music two years ago. The Ewe hitmaker told Daily Sun he was returning to his first love, which is education. Last month, the 33-year-old from Mthatha opened Musk Academy in Lebowakgomo, outside Polokwane with fellow rapper Pabalelo “Papzito” Selema (27). They tutor pupils and adults who want to upgrade their matric results. Ifani said for now, they were completing the academy’s registration. The pair, who met in 2016, said they came up with the idea in October. They told Daily Sun they have been offering tutorials since high school. Ifani has an honours degree in computer science, while Papzito has a BSc in engineering. Papzito said they used mobile classrooms. “We need funds to build a proper academy. We are also looking for land for a laboratory.” He said their dream was to offer their services for free but they couldn’t do it without funding. He said they had about 30 pupils.. Constance Letakgomo (28) said: “I love how they teach us with passion”.
