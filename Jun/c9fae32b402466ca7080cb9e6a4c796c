Sbuda M had always loved singing but he never thought he would be a musician. The singer from Nhlazatshe in Mpumalanga said his musical journey started last year as an experiment with a friend. He told SunBuzz: “I’d always post videos of myself singing gospel on social media, but I did it as a hobby. “My friend Spha De Voice noticed I loved singing and asked me to feature on his song Thembalami. “After hearing the song, I was convinced I was meant to be a musician. “I’ve been working on myself and teaching myself about music since then.” Sbuda M said he thought of doing gospel music because that’s what he loved, but his fans convinced him otherwise. “After people heard the song I had done with my friend, they convinced me to continue with house music. “I am now comfortable in this space. “I hope more people will appreciate my music the way the people from my community do,” said Sbuda. He released his debut single Uthando Lwam three months ago. He’s now working on his debut EP which will be released later this year. He said: “My EP aims to put Mpumalanga on the map. “We have a lot of talent but no one supports or recognises us. “It’s time people saw us and started to learn about our talent.”
