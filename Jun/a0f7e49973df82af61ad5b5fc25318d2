AN RDP housing project has come to a standstill in Gunguluza kasi in Uitenhage. This after workers demanded better wages and working conditions. The angry workers put down tools since Saturday. They claimed Power Construction Company from Cape Town did not keep the promises they made to them. Workers gathered in front of the construction site yesterday and defied a warning letter, refusing to go back to work. Worker Siyabonga Keye (29) said: “When this project started in July, the first 20 workers were given 12- month contracts. Then all other workers were promised three-month contracts. “We spent four months without payment while we were given 12-month contracts.” The company’s site manager Hugo Pretorius refused to speak to Daily Sun. But a warning letter he sent to the 36 workers relating to the unprotected protest read: “The company cannot continue to try to operate in an environment which prevents production from taking place.”
