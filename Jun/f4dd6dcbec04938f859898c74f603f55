Top actor Kabelo Moalusi sees life through the eyes of his characters. “My characters have taught me what life is. Today I understand kindness and compassion,” he told Daily Sun. He regards lessons he has learnt from his current role of Prince Tumelo Kwena in The Throne as the most important. “Tumelo’s difficulties when he lost the child he had with Dipuo have made me put myself into other people’s shoes. “Tumelo grew up lacking basic human interaction. “But he has the best interests of his family and community of Kweneng,” said 35-year-old Kabelo. He said as much as he enjoyed playing his character of Prince, he was not a prince and had no tribal roots. “If I was Prince I’d invest my responsibilities in research into our history, language and herbs that contribute to natural health.” Off the TV screens, Kabelo is an active community member who’s passionate about the development of poor areas. He has, for example, helped to introduce a programme that engages pupils in their mother tongue at Atlholang Primary School in Kagiso west of Joburg, where he grew up. “I adopted the programme from Asian countries, where pupils are taught in their mother tongue.” Kabelo can relate to the importance of mother tongue from his own childhood experience. When he was moved to Laerskool Bekker in Magaliesberg, he found himself in a new world. “I had to learn in a new language and my confidence dropped,” he said. Kabelo was studying marketing and business management when he got into acting. “I wanted to make extra money and I did modelling and acting,” he said. Many people will remember him as Siya Radebe on Generations, Ofentse Moloi on Isidingo, and Mokau Malefo in Bones of my Bones.
