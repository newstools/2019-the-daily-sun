NYANGA CPF secretary Dumisani Qwebe has called on parents to play their part in fighting crime. Speaking to Daily Sun, Qwebe said: “Poor parenting is a major problem. “People don’t take care for their children and shift their responsibility to others. “Some kids leave home at 9pm and roam the streets all night.” Qwebe said Nyanga CPF patrollers were shocked recently when they bumped into a 12-year-old boy in the streets at about 3am. “When I asked what he was doing out that late, he said he had told his parents he was going to enjoy himself with friends! “What kind of parent allows a child that age to be out at that hour? “Parents should play their role in raising kids well. Your kid is your responsibility.” Qwebe said some of the reasons many kids are in danger was because they come from broken families. “Many dads that don’t live with their kids and don’t take part in moulding them. “Please, guys. Don’t be away from your kids. They need you. “In many of our encounters with problem children, we’ve noticed that absent fathers was the underlying factor. “Even if the dad is no longer part of the family, they should nurture their children.”
