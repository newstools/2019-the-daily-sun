IZINYOKA cables hang low and loose from poles and tree branches. Some lie dangerously on the ground and across the road. Many people have died because of them. But residents love the izinyoka, the people behind the laying of the loose cables and illegal electricity connections. They said they would rather die than to have someone removing the cables. “Yes, they kill us. But we love them all the same,” said a resident of Vlakfontein near Leratong, Mogale City. Residents said they would chase away anyone from Eskom or the municipality who came to disconnect the cables. “We can’t go without our televisions,” said a resident. Residents said they resorted to using illegal connections because the government had failed to keep its promises. “Before we voted, the government was good to us, promising us a better life. But we know they are not going to keep their promises,” said another resident. Eskom deputy spokeswoman Dikatso Mothae said illegal connections were a danger to communities. She discouraged people from connecting to the power grid illegally and urged residents to call 0800 112 722 to have illegal cables removed.
