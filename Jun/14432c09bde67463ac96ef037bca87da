Two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya is hoping her impressive victory at the European Outdoor Classic meeting in Montreuil, France on Tuesday will inspire Banyana Banyana. Semenya spent some time with Banyana, who are also in France for the FIFA Women’s World Cup ahead of their second match of the tournament. They play China at the Parc des Princes on Thursday (9pm SA Time).Desiree Ellis’ charges need to get something from the game in order to enhance their chances of progressing to the Knockout stages in their maiden World Cup appearance. Banyana will look to draw inspiration from Semenya, who despite currently being locked in a legal battle with the IAAF over its testosterone rules, continues to win against all odds. Semenya coasted home in 5:38.19 to win the women's 2 000m contest in Montreuil yesterday, narrowly missing out on the South African record set by Zola Budd in Cape Town in April 1991. “I thought I should come here show them that we are behind them all the way. If I can win so can they, they must go out there fight as a team. Being here is a token of appreciation from me to them,” said Semenya.
