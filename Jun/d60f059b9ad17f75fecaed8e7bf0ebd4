THE community of Winterveld lost another leader on Tuesday. Former councillor Amos Mampheko (47) was shot dead after a meeting with the local ANC Youth League. His murder comes just a year after Councillor Esther Matumane was shot dead in the Tshwane kasi. Local youth league secretary Matlhatsi Moningi (33) said everyone was going home when Mampheko was shot. “Amos was in his car with other comrades he was giving a lift to when a man appeared out of nowhere. He stopped the car and fired three shots at Mampheko,” he said. Moningi said they rushed him to the clinic, where he died. “We struggled to take him out of the car and the service was poor. It was too late for him to be helped,” he said. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of murder was opened and the suspect was still at large. “We are appealing to those who saw the incident to come forward with information.” Anyone with information should visit Loate cop shop or call 08600 10111.
