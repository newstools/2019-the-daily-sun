MPUMALANGA Community Safety MEC Gabisile Shabalala has called for an end to attacks on tourists. She said they impacted negatively on the province’s tourism industry. Over the past few weeks, several visitors to Hazyview, Sabie and Graskop have been hijacked and robbed. Most of the crimes take place in remote areas, where motorists stop to look at the view. The occupants are then robbed of valuables such as cash, bank cards and cellphones. It appears that in some cases tourists are observed at certain spots and followed. Shabalala said attacking tourists portrayed the province and the country in a bad light and scared off potential investors. “We are calling on communities to partner with the government and the police to bring an end to attacks directed at tourists. We must work hand in hand with communities to bring these criminals to book. They must be harshly punished,” she said. Shabalala said tourism played an important role in growing the economy and creating jobs. “Tourism provides for the effective domestic and international marketing of the province and the country.” Police confirmed that theft and robbery cases had been opened, but no arrests made.
