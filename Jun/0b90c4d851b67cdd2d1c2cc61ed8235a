Zinhle Mabaso’s dream of being an actor has finally come true. The 23-year-old actress from Soweto recently landed a role in SABC2’s Xitsonga drama series, Giyani: Land Of Blood. “I always told my mum I wanted to be an actor. I loved acting from the age of five and have been trying to get roles ever since,” Zinhle said. “I’ve been getting small roles but now I’ve finally got my big break. I’ll use this opportunity to show off my talent.” She almost did not get the chance to act in the first Xitsonga TV drama series. In 2017 she was involved in a car accident while on her way to the audition, and arrived at the venue long after they had wrapped up. “By the time I got there, everybody was gone. I was shattered. I went home thinking the chance had passed me forever,” said Zihle. When another opportunity opened up, she went for it and landed the role of Matimba, the personal secretary of young lawyer Vukosi Baloyi (Fumani Shilubana). She will appear on the show from next month. Zinhle, who studied acting at the New York Film Academy, in 2016, has big dreams. “I was inspired by Charlize Theron. While studying abroad I developed an interest in acting overseas, like her. “That’s the aim for me right now. I’m not doing this for fame, though. I’m doing it because I love it. I believe in myself and my talent.” Zinhle is also a model and beauty queen. She was the first princess in the 2015 Miss Junior South Africa. She was also brand ambassador for Miss Vilakazi Street in 2016.
