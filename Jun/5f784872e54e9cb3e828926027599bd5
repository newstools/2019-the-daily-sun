Nakhane has been touring the world and has relocated to the UK. But speaking to Huffington Post US recently, Nakhane denied that he had fled the country, saying it simply made sense for him to move for the sake of his career. "I didn’t flee - that’s not really the way it happened. While all of this is happening, the album was getting mixed and mastered. I knew I was going to do a lot of press in Europe. So it made sense, practically, to move," he explained.
