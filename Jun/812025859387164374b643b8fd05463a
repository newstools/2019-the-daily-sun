THREE cars were involved in a crash after a tyre burst on Saturday, leaving six people dead. The following night, a bike and a Polo sedan crashed on the same road, killing the biker. Daily Sun spoke to Netcare911 spokesman Shawn Herbst regarding the Saturday afternoon crash. He said they responded to the scene on the N8 between Bloemfontein and Botshabelo. “Reports indicated that bakkies were involved in a head-on collision,” Herbst said. Paramedics found five people were fatally injured and were declared dead on the scene. “Another person sustained critical injuries but sadly passed away a short while later in hospital. “Four other patients sustained moderate injuries and were transported to hospital.” Police spokesman Sergeant Martin Xuma said a culpable homicide case was opened. Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela said: “I’d like to send our deepest condolences to the bereaved families. May the souls of those who lost their lives rest in peace.” On Sunday night, a biker was killed after being hit by a white VW Polo. It’s alleged the Polo driver failed to give the biker right of way when he turned at a crossway. A cop said: “The Polo was turning to the right and did not stop for the bike to pass. “The biker (37) was declared dead at the scene and the Polo driver (49) was taken to hospital as he was suspected to be under the influence of alcohol. We have opened a case of culpable homicide.”
