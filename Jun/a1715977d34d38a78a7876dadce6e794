MOST artists write songs before going into the studio, but Viwe “Sdumo Viwe” Ndengendenge is different. The house vocalist and sangoma just starts singing and, according to him, he channels his ancestors. Viwe from Langa in Cape Town said before he became a sangoma, he used to get sick a lot and had scary visions. “Nothing I did went right until I accepted my gift, and now I’m doing fine.” He said he’s happy his ancestors allowed him to follow his dreams. “When you’re a sangoma, it’s not only about you. It’s also about the person inside of you. “There are things you can’t do, even though you still have to live your life. “I believe the person inside of me, one of my ancestors, loved music. That’s why it’s easy for me to do this. “People need to understand that being a sangoma is not child’s play. You need to consult before you do anything.” Viwe said people who listen to his album Intelezi will feel healed. “Intelezi is a medicine that makes you feel light and free. That’s exactly what will happen to everyone who listens to my music.” His album features well-known artists such as Distruction Boyz and Bizza Wethu, as well as DJs Ruben and ’Ngamla.
