Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has named his final 23-man Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) squad. CAF rules allow for only 23 players to be registered for the tournament, as a result, Baxter had to trim down his initial 28-man squad. After the withdrawal of France-based midfielder Keagan Dolly through injury and Mamelodi Sundowns defender Rivaldo Coetzee for personal reasons, Baxter only had to drop three more players. The unlucky trio to miss out on a spot in the final squad are Cape Town City’s Kermit Erasmus, Orlando Pirates’ Ben Motshwari and Maritzburg United’s Fortune Makaringe. On Monday, Bafana will leave the country for a mini-camp in Dubai, where they will face Ghana before heading to Cairo for the Afcon finals. They will open their Afcon campaign against Ivory Coast on June 24.
