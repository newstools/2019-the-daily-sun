PASTOR Ntombekhaya Nyma-Plati runs a holiday programme for kids in Marikana squatter camp, Cape Town. “We keep them busy so they go back to school safe,” she said. The project shared by the Genesis Faith Mission and the Thwalisanani Bafazi organisation takes place on Mondays, when they cook for the kids and invite speakers. “Cops spoke to them about crime and social development about growing up and how to help others,” Plati said. Ncedisa Qabazi from the Movement For Change and Social Justice also spoke to the kids about sex and condom use. Likhaya Mlandwana (14) said: “We’re grateful for people like Plati who look out for us.” Parent Nwabisa Nyakombi (48) said the pastor is fighting crime in a smart way. Plati said: “We need sponsors. On our first day we had over 250 kids who came.”
