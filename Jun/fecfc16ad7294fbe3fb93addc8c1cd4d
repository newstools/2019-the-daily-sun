THE mayor of Umzinyathi Municipality in Dundee, northern KZN, is in hot water. The ANC is calling for an investigation into IFP mayor Petros Ngubane’s purchase of eight trucks for his own personal benefit. It has called on KZN Co-operative Governance MEC Sipho Hlomuka to ask the Special Investigating Unit to probe how Ngubane could afford to buy eight trucks for R8 million cash. ANC regional chairman Lucky Moloi said the party wanted the mayor to be subjected to a lifestyle audit. “We want allegations of extortion to be investigated to determine where the mayor got the money from,” said Moloi. IFP spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa confirmed the party was investigating the allegations. Cogta spokesman Senzo Mzila said the matter would be looked into. Ngubane denied the trucks cost R8 million. He said he had been a teacher for 36 years and bought the trucks from his investments.
