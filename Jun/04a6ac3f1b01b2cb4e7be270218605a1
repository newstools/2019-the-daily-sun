BLACK Leopards are set to lose yet another player. Midfielder Eden Nene, whose contract with the Venda-based side is set to expire at the end of this month, has been linked with a move to Polokwane City. “He is excited about joining City,” said a source close to the player. The 31-year-old from Kwandengezi has been with Leopards for the past two seasons, having joined them from Stellenbosch. Other players rumoured to be on their way out at Leopards are Marks Munyai and Phathutshedzo Nange. Munyai has joined Highlands Park, while Nange is heading to Bidvest Wits. Ivan Mahangwahaya, Jean Munganga and Robert Ngambi are also leaving after they were told their contracts won’t be renewed.
