NUNUZI Zuma (41) is struggling to cope with her baby’s death. Nunuzi from Imbali in Pietermaritzburg said she took her six-month-old daughter Lwandiswa Zuma to the Mediclinic Hospital last week after she got flu. She said the nurse injected the baby early on Friday morning. Nunuzi thought Lwandiswa was sleeping but when she woke up and touched her, she was cold. She claims the baby died after being given the injection. “I want the nurse to be charged and go to jail. I won’t accept an apology. This is a disaster. She killed my baby.” Nunuzi said what also angered her was that hospital management wanted the death to be registered as a natural death but didn’t say what the cause was. She said the postmortem was done after she demanded it be done, but Daily Sun could not find out what the results were. “I opened a case but police said it would be changed if it is found that someone has to face charges,” she said. Captain Nqobile Gwala said Pietermaritzburg police opened an inquest docket and were investigating the circumstances surrounding the child’s death. Hospital spokeswoman Reshnee Beekrum said they were aware of the matter, but their investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the nurse.
