METROPOLITAN Trading Company is worried about the rising theft and vandalism of the City of Joburg’s telecoms infrastructure. Thieves have damaged manhole covers that seal the city’s fibre optic cables. Quality assurance officer Latief Fisher said heavy trucks also damage manholes when they drive over them. Covers are mainly sold on the black market. Joburg Metro Police’s Martindale office as well as the areas of Westbury and Industria West are the latest to be hit. Fisher said: “A CCTV camera was recently damaged at the Main Reef and Nursery roads intersection. The suspect was caught on camera. The damage is concerning.” He said when residents report that digital services are down, technicians often find it is due to copper theft, which damages the fibre optic cables. “While the city tries to move towards a digital city, crime sets it back,” he said. Fisher said the company would send technicians to the affected sites for repairs. Field technician Sipho Phakathi said fixing the infrastructure took many hours and cost a lot. He said digitally savvy city residents needed technologically advanced services but theft and vandalism affect its delivery. The company appealed to people to report vandalism. He said: “Scrapyard dealers shouldn’t promote or buy stolen municipal property.”
