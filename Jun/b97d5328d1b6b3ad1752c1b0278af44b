"In sporting terms Luka Jovic will be a real loss for us, but we obviously knew in this case that every player has their price," said Eintracht board member Fredi Bobic. "It is an important piece of transfer business for Eintracht Frankfurt, and a good one as well. We wish Luka all the very best for the future. He has got everything he needs to have a wonderful career, and we’re proud to have been able to help and support him on his way." Los Blancos are looking to rebuild after a season of struggles which saw them finish third in La Liga and get knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Uefa Champions League by Ajax Amsterdam.
