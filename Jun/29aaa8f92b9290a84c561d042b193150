THEY call their kasi Soweto-on-Sea. But all the residents know is that their area has been turned into a sea of kak. It’s a kak kasi! This is all because criminals have made the Port Elizabeth kasi a no go area. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal officials have been refusing to go to the area to provide services since October for fear of being robbed. “A pigsty is better than this place,” gogo Siziwe Nomahomba (65) told Daily Sun. “There is overflowing raw sewage in front of my kitchen door. When residents in Hlanganani Street flush a toilet, kak comes out and flows into the street.” Amanda Makepula (33) said her daughter (3) was always sick because of the foul smell. “She always has a running stomach and skin rash. We asked creches not to close during the school holidays because our kids have no other place to play,” she said. Ward 27 Councillor Zoliswa Dlula confirmed the area was violent. She said she had to escort municipal workers to do their job. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “Municipal officials have been robbed while doing their work. This affects service delivery as we have to ask for escorts. “Another challenge is the vandalism of the sewage infrastructure. This leads to blockages. We call upon residents to work with us on this.”
