BUSISIWE ‘Cici’ Twala had temporary paralysis after being allegedly dragged with a car for 300 metres by the then boyfriend Arthur Mafokate. This was according to the state’s witness, Dr Thomas Ramakgopa told the court that when she saw the songstress, she was in pain and could not move. Ramakgopa took the stand at the Midrand Magistrate court where self-proclaimed King of Kwaito, Arthur was appearing for assault charges. In his findings, Ramokgopa said she was young, in pain and she couldn't move. “She had bruises in the left side on the pelvic area.  The skin over the bone was affected, she was swollen because of internal bleeding. “The rest of the body she was fine” He also revealed that Cici had a broken pelvic bone and that if it bleeds, a person can lose up to three litres of blood. But in this case, the bleeding was contained. When asked if the injuries Cici sustained are consistent with the story that she was dragged by a moving car, Ramokgopa said, “Yes, I would say so.” “She had aberrations, if you fall and I drag you, you will have abrasions.” He said the injuries are consistent with the story. Days after the incident, Cici took to social media and stated that she may never had children due to the injuries she sustained during the incident. But Ramokgopa said, when she asked her about bearing of children, he said she can be able to have as many children as she wants. On September 11, Ramokgopa said Cici he was walking well, fully weight-bearing. He said, “At that time, we wouldn’t be able to determine the permanent injury or damage,” that was when he asked if there is a possibility of permanent injuries. Arthur, who was in company of his legal team, was content in the stand. He was simply dressed in a grey suit with white T-shirt. When approached for a comment, Mafokate refused to speak citing that he was told not to speak to the media.
