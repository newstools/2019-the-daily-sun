BENEDICT “Tso” Vilakazi was one of Orlando Pirates’ best players in the early 2000s. He was a fan favourite with his disciplined displays in the middle of the park. Born in Diepkloof, Soweto, he grew up in the Buccaneers’ development ranks and was promoted to the first team around 1999. For whatever he lacked in height, he made up with a strong physical presence. He had a heart of a Lion and whether he was playing for Bafana Bafana or Pirates, midfield opposition players felt the wrath and the dedication of the stocky fighter. Former Kaizer Chiefs coach Paul Dolezar feared and respect Vilakazi and gave him the nickname “The Little Napoleon”. He left Pirates to try his luck overseas but he had an unsuccessful spell in Denmark. He returned to the PSL and joined big-spenders Mamelodi Sundowns. Towards the end of his career, he played for clubs such as Mpumalanga Black Aces and Black Leopards, before heading off to Swaziland and Botswana. He also played for the SA Under-23 side, Amajita and won 31 caps for Bafana Bafana. What is your fondest memory of “Tso” in his playing days?
