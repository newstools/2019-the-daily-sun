ALL madala wants is a house. Madala Macaleni Gumede (75) from KwaDlangezwa in Empangeni, northern KZN, said he has been living in a decaying house for the past three years. “Water floods into the house when it rains and I get wet while sleeping,” said Gumede. He said he goes through the same suffering in winter as the cold keeps him awake. He said he built the house with his pension money more than 10 years ago. The madala said he did not have children and the women he met in the past kept leaving him, so he lives by himself. “If I had kids, maybe they would have built me a house,” he said. Councillor Gugu Qulo said: “I am not in the right position to speak about this matter. Allow me to give you Ncalane’s number so you can call him because I don’t want to comment.” Mdu Ncalane, the uMhlathuze municipal spokesman, said they were aware of madala’s case. “We came to a conclusion that Gumede doesn’t require a house but needs to be moved to a safe place. We engaged with the KZN Department of Social Development on this issue,” said Ncalane. He said Gumede’s situation didn’t allow him to have a house. “He’s literally living alone with no one to support him. His eyesight’s also affected and many other challenges. We note the assistance from the business sector and hope Gumede’s challenges will be considered,” he said.
