EDWARD Thobejane regrets giving away his money so it could be invested, rather than putting it in the bank. The 62-year-old madala from Seshego zone 8 outside Polokwane worked for Enterprise for 35 years until 2010. He said he had to get help to claim his pension.“I found a lawyer called Lesiba Modikwa to help me and finally received R666 000. I paid him R157 000 for his services.” The madala told Daily Sun he started looking at where he could invest his money. “I went to banks but found out the interest was not enough. “Modikwa tricked me into investing R100 000 in a certain company. I gave him the money to invest on my behalf.” Edward said they had an agreement that he would receive interest of 4%, which meant R4 000 for 12 months. “I only received R3 900 once and when I asked him about the rest, he always gave me excuses. He later told me the company I invested in had collapsed.” Edward did not believe it ever existed. “He said he would make a plan to give me back my money, but nine years down the line he has not given me a cent. I have a house to complete and kids to feed. I’m relying on my grant for survival. That money would make a big difference.” He said he’s learnt not to trust people with money. Modikwa said the madala invested the money in a company. “I told him the company was no longer operating but I’ll try my best to help get his money back. He must be patient because my things are not going well right now.” Edward said he didn’t open a case.
