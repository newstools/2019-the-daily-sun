THE tent pitched at Block U Extension in Tshwane on Sunday morning was packed with mourners who came to Gontse Ramarimela’s funeral. Gontse (9) died last week after she was allegedly mauled by a neighbour’s dog at her home. Last Thursday Daily Sun carried the story with the headline: “Dog killed my kid!” The family is still struggling to cope with her loss. Emotions at her funeral service were running high as speakers described how Gontse loved people and how she was everyone’s friend. Her Sunday school teacher, George Ntshudisane, said her death had affected all of them. “We have been losing children at our church. Almost every week we bury a child. This is affecting us,” he said. Her school teacher, Matshidiso Tshikane, said they were going to miss her presence in her class. “She was a bright girl who was very talkative. She used to compliment me whenever I had a new hairstyle or new clothes,” Matshidiso said. Gontse was buried at Klipgat Cemetery in Tshwane.
