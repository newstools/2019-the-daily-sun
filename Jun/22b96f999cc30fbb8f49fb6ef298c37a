CASUAL and contract municipal workers are up in arms and are demanding permanent jobs. Yesterday, the workers staged a protest outside the OR Tambo district municipality’s offices in Mthatha, Eastern Cape. They said they were promised full-time jobs and danger allowances several years ago but this never happened. Ayanda Fani (62) said he started working for the municipality in 2010 as a contract worker. “I have four children and an extended family that I support with the R3 500 I’m paid here. Sometimes I take out loans to get by,” said Ayanda. He said he was once stabbed on the job but couldn’t claim workmen’s compensation. Bongiswa Ndwangu (45), who started working for the municipality in 2003, said workers fought fires in jeans. “We buy our own boots and use our own money,” she said. Samwu has given the municipality until mid-July to resolve the issue. Municipal manager Bongani Matomela said the municipality always discussed issues raised by workers at local labour forums. He denied workers didn’t have protective clothing. The municipality was also looking at a danger pay policy, he said.
