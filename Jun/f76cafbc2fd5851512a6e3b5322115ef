 Former ministers Jeff Radebe and Siyabonga Cwele have also
resigned as MPs after failing to crack the nod in President Cyril Ramaphosa's new
Cabinet. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo confirmed on Monday that
Radebe and Cwele had tendered their resignations. Radebe - a veteran of seven ministries going back to 1994 - said
two weeks ago that he was ready to enjoy the routines of "normal
life" and immerse himself into new possibilities. The pair join a growing number of former ministers who have in
recent weeks resigned as ordinary members of the National Assembly after being
left out of Ramaphosa's recently announced Cabinet. Last week, former minister of sport and recreation Tokozile Xasa
joined former ministers Susan Shabangu, Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba and Nomaindia
Mfeketo in submitting letters of resignation as MPs. Their replacements will be sworn in on Monday, although it is not
immediately apparent who will be replacing Cwele and Radebe. ANC Chief Whip, Pemmy Majodina, previously confirmed that: Fikile Masiko will replace Shabangu; Former deputy minister of finance Sfiso Buthelezi will replace
Letsatsi-Duba; Tshoganetso Tongwane will replace Mfeketo; Nombulelo Lillian Hermans will replace Silvia Lucas, who withdrew
from the list due to her deployment as deputy chairperson of the National
Council of Provinces; Emily Manketsi Thlape will replace Ramaphosa, who ceased being a
MP after his elections as president; Judy Hermans will replace Xasa; and Lindiwe Mjobo will replace Makhosini Nkosi, who did not take up
his seat. SOURCE: NEWS24
