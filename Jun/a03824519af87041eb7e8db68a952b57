MAMELODI Sundowns boss Patrice Motsepe is confident that Bafana Bafana will do the nation proud at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon). Bafana will get their campaign underway today with a clash against the Ivory Coast at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo (16h30). They will be hoping to get off to a flying start against the Ivorians before locking horns with Namibia and then Morocco in their other two Group D matches. Bafana were visited by SAFA president Danny Jordaan, Sports and Recreation minister Nathi Mthethwa and Motsepe, who all shared some words of encouragement ahead of the match later today. “The minister brings lots and lots of luck and that’s why his presence here, in terms of good energy and historical blessings, is very important. And of course thanks to Danny and everybody who is here from the leadership of football,” said Motsepe. “There’s nothing that I can say that has not been said, but the two things is that you arrived here because of hard work and huge sacrifices and you proved it to yourselves, the country, as well as to people all over the world. “Nobody did you a favour. You’ve made us so proud and everybody in South Africa is 100 percent behind each and every one of you, those who will play and those who might not play. “But I just want to say that everyone here is part of history, part of South African history. We are so confident. Implement what the coach told you and we will win.”
