THEY might be known for their deserts and cheetah population, but the Nambians have a dream – to BEAT BAFANA BAFANA! And this would augur well for their coach Ricardo Mannetti, who would have the mental freedom should his charges beat Stuart Baxter’s Bafana in Friday’s Group D match (10pm). Mannetti told the Namibian Football Association website that he has come full cycle in his Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) history, having taken part as a player 1998 and now as a coach. The good news is that Namibia have the 48-year-old Ronnie Kananelo as assistant coach to Mannetti. Kananelo has played for PSL side Mamelodi Sundowns between 1997 to 2005, and would give pointers to his coach as they plot Bafana’s downfall. He said the Brave Warriors were “inexperienced and rookies” in 1998 when his country took part in Afcon. “Now I’m here coaching and that feeling is priceless and difficult to explain,” said Mannetti. Mannetti’s second assistant coach Collin Benjamin has also played at the Afcon finals in 2008. “We now want people to take note of Namibia football,” quipped Mannetti.
