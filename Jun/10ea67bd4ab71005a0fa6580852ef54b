THE BODY of a woman with seven gunshot wounds has been found dumped in Delft. Gang wars continue to ravage the area. The Delft Community Policing Forum claimed 22 people have been killed in multiple shooting incidents in the area in the past week alone. Cape Town police could not confirm the number. Chairman of the CPF, Charles George, said most of the shootings were gang related. “In the past week we had 22 murders in Delft. Most of them were gang related. “From the CPF’s side we are working with the police and want to say to the community that we are holding the police accountable as well. “We believe that collectively we can bring about a solution to the problems we are currently facing,” said George. Six people where shot and killed at Q block 84 in Blikkiesdorp on Thursday night, with other shootings taking place in the streets over the weekend. The dead woman with seven gun shots was found in the bushes near Symphony Way on Friday afternoon. When the SunTeam visited the scene, many people from the area said they were living in fear. “The rate at which people are dying in our area is worrying. “I saw the body of a cab driver lying on the street on Wednesday. “It’s the second time in three days that I’ve come across a dead body. It’s scary. I think I have to go and stay somewhere else,” said Phelisa Sompali, who lives in Leiden, Delft. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the death of the woman. “The circumstances surrounding the death of an unknown female in her late twenties whose body was found in the bush next to Symphony Way, Delft is under investigation. “A murder case was registered for investigation,” said Traut.
