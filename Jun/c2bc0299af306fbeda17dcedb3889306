“So vele at that Meek show yesterday there was not even one rapper that raps in a South African Language at the Sway cyphers” He wrote. Rappers such as A-Reece, Rouge and Moozlie impressed US hip-hop head and radio presenter Sway Calloway when they dropped bar after bar during an improvised freestyle cyclical rapping session aka cypher. But Sjava clearly touched a couple of nerves when he expressed his disappointment at the lack of vernac representation on that stage. The singer explained that he was not criticising English rappers, that he just wanted to highlight that at least one rapper could have been authentic enough to impress in their vernacular. When one tweep said “It’s not that deep” Sjava responded with “it is deep what do you mean its not that deep??? Its very deep its deeper than you think actually” While some seemed to agree with the rapper and said there should have been at least one rapper who represented Mzansi languages, others thought he should give people freedom of choice.
