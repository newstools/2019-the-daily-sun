The V&A Waterfront in Cape Town is investigating an
incident after DA MP Phumzile van Damme posted about an alleged racist ordeal
at the popular tourist destination on Tuesday. In a video on Twitter, van Damme explained what happened in her
view, saying she was standing in a queue when she had a quarrel with the mother
of a family at one of the supermarkets. The mother allegedly told her she would
"push [her] aside". "Then when I went out, she was standing there with her
family in a threatening manner. And I went to her and said, 'why are you
looking at me in a threatening manner?' Then she said, 'it's because you're
black'." At this point, her voice becomes emotional. Van Damme said the incident resulted in her punching a young
man "in self-defence", after he came into her space and allegedly
said "voetsek you black" and threw her phone on the ground. She shared her frustration with the way a manager from the
Waterfront dealt with her complaint.    She shared that the correct thing would have been for the
manager to take her details and apologise for what happened. She asked that the
centre ban the family from the premises. In response, Waterfront spokesperson Donald Kau said they
had noted her tweets and "are engaging with her directly on this issue, as
well as with the security manager involved to get a full account of the
incident". Kau said they were also reviewing video footage of the
alleged incident. "We do not tolerate any act of racism at the V&A
Waterfront, an environment which daily sees thousands of visitors from all
walks of life, from all over the country, and all over the world, enjoying its
facilities," said Kau. "We would ban anyone who displays racist behaviour on
the property, with immediate effect."  https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/da-mp-phumzile-van-damme-throws-punch-in-self-defence-waterfront-probing-race-row-20190618
