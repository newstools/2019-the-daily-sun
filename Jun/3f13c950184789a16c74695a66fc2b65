SUNSPORT insiders have revealed that Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp has made his intentions known to be reunited with Supersport United striker Evans Rusike. Chiefs, who had a tough 2018/19 seasonfinishing ninth on the log table and alsolosing the Nedbank Cup final, are said to have made an offer for the Zimbabwe striker. They are looking to bolster their squadfollowing the departure of Gustavo Paez, Ryan Moon, Bongo Jayiya, Hendrick Ekstein, Kgotso Malope. “Chiefs submitted an offer for Evans Rusike and the player is likely to be reunited with coach Middendorp next season,’’ said the mole. This comes as no surprise. Rusike, who joined Matsantsantsa A Pitori in the second half of 2017/18 season from MaritzburgUnited, was previously linked with Chiefs. But Maritzburg chairman Farook Kadodia was unwilling to sell. When the 28-year-old worked withMiddendorp at The Team of Choice in 2015/16 season, he was excellent in what was his first season in the PSL. Rusike scored nine league goals in 27 league appearances, including two in the last game of that season against Jomo Cosmos as Maritzburg retained their PSLstatus. He was named club’s Player of the Season and also walked away with the club’s Golden Shoe award.
