This cute toddler isn’t afraid to speak his mind. Kingston Pryor (18 months) from Tennessee in the US, has become an online sensation after his mother shared a video of him expressing his thoughts and feelings to his dad, Deztin (26), Unilad reports. The video, which was posted to Facebook on Tuesday, shows the toddler engaged in what appears to be a serious conversation with his dad while the two sit back and watch TV, Daily Mail reports. “Only this child! Having a full-fledged conversation with Daddy and Daddy’s just as bad,” mom Shanieke captioned the video that’s been viewed more than 11 million times. Deztin, who’s a stand-up comedian, asks little Kingston, “Did you understand it though?” to which the little one responds with what sounds like a “no”. The father and son duo continue going back and forth for the duration of the video while the little boy becomes increasingly animated with his baby talk. The clip ends with the two continuing with their discussion, which is enough to make anyone broody. Users were quick to comment on the toddler’s impressive communication development with one person writing, “If you pay attention, this baby is holding a conversation! He’s not mimicking.” “Just lovely, a dad and boy speaking their own language,” another added.  https://www.parent24.com/Lifestyle/watch-toddler-and-dad-have-adorable-conversation-while-watching-tv-20190606
