THE community of Msholozi, outside White River in Mpumalanga, is reeling from shock after a nine-year-old girl was raped. To add more to their shock, the girl’s mum was burnt to death on Sunday morning, allegedly by an unknown man who ran away. Shocked community members told Daily Sun they were still traumatised by the incident. They said they were now living in fear. Lucy Makhubele (38) told the People’s Paper they found the girl outside the house, bleeding. “She was terrified, shocked, bleeding and in pain,” she said. Lucy said the community would also do their own investigations to help cops arrest the culprit. Pienaar police spokeswoman Captain Jabu Ndubane said firefighters were called to the scene. “After the fire was put out, a person’s remains were found in the house. It is suspected to be the mother of the victim,” she said. Ndubane said police have opened cases of rape, arson and murder. “No one has been arrested yet. We urge anyone with information to come forward. They can contact Captain Pat Banda on 082 449 0334.”
