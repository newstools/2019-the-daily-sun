ON WEDNESDAY, things finally started looking up for gogo Khokhi Nxumalo. KZN Human Settlements MEC Peggy Nkonyeni and Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza visited gogo Khokhi at her home in Bhukhanana in Empangeni, northern KZN. They promised her that her days of living in a one-roomed mud hut would soon be over. Nkonyeni said her department would make sure the gogo, her five grandkids, and two great-grandchildren would be given a better place to live in less than a month. “We’re bringing along a contractor who’s going to begin the work of building gogo a stronger house.” Nkonyeni said she learned of the gogo’s situation in the media. Khoza said they brought gogo groceries because they wanted to make sure she and the kids didn’t go to bed on empty stomachs. “We’ll also be checking if the social grants of all the kids are up to date.” Gogo Khokhi said she was happy her life would finally change. She said her one-roomed mud house was in a terrible state. She said when it rained she and her family were forced to gather in one corner as the water flooded the rest of the room.
