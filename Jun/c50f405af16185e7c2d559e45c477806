A FORMER top cop
during the Marikana massacre appeared in court earlier today. According to The Citizen,former
North West deputy police commissioner William Mpembe  appeared in the North West High Court
on charges of contravening the Commission Act, contravening the Independent
Police Investigative Directorate Act and defeating the ends of justice.  He is charged along
with Gideon van Zyl, Dingaan Madoda and Oupa Pule. They allegedly failed to disclose that mineworker
Modisaotsile van Wyk Sagalala died in police custody on the premises of the
Lonmin mine on August 16, 2012. Mpembe’s defence accused the State of withholding documents. Advocate Jan Ellis, for Mpembe, launched an application in
the court asking that the State disclose the contents of two dockets related to
the case. He told the court that he did not buy the State’s contention
that the two dockets were under investigation. “I do not understand how these cases are still under
investigation since 2012,” he said. He wanted the contents of the dockets relating to two crime
scenes emanating from the Marikana massacre in which 34 mineworkers were killed
by police during violent protest action on August 16, 2012. Scene one was at a koppie near Nkaneng informal settlement
where striking mineworkers were shot, while scene two is a small koppie about
150m away from the infamous Marikana koppie where other mineworkers were
killed.
