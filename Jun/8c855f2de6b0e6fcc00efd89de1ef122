HARD-WORKING hair salon owners in Ga-Rankuwa kasi, north of Tshwane, are at the mercy of thugs. Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi urged the hair salon owners as well as residents to be vigilant. He told Daily Sun: “Cases of armed robbery at hair salons in and around this policing precinct have been on the rise in the past few weeks.” Nkoadi said the evil thugs especially targeted businesses that operate until late at night. Nkoadi said some salon owners had recently been robbed of cash and cellphones, while some had been hijacked. “Police are appealing to business owners to reconsider their operating times,” he said. Nkoadi said business owners in the kasi should avoid closing late. Salon owner Lerato Marang (37) said she normally closes late at night. “My salon is one of the busiest and I have many clients,” she said. “Now I’ll have to start closing early to avoid getting robbed.” Another salon owner, Kutlwano Modikwe (42), told the SunTeam: “This has to stop. We’re now going to lose clients because they’ll be afraid to get robbed or hijacked.” Kutlwano said no one wants to go to an unsafe place. Nkoadi advised salon owners who notice any suspicious activity to report to the CrimeStop number 08600 10111 or to SMS crime line 32211.
