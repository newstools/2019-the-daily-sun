A TOP COP is among four people who will be arrested in relation to the death of Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa. This according to a report in the Sunday World reported by the Citizen. They reveal that three well-known individuals, along with a “top cop” will soon be arrested for defeating the ends of justice, while a fifth will be arrested for the murder itself. This person is reportedly “well known”. The remaining three suspects are said to be the “mother of one of the suspects” and “two other people. The police are reportedly investigating witnesses for concealing evidence to protect the murder suspect. Almost five years after the death of the soccer star,the arrests should they happen would bring some peace to Meyiwa’s family especially his father Sam who suffered a stroke last year. The family has been calling for justice for years. The suspects have reportedly all been subjected to lie detector tests already. Meyiwa was shot to death at his girlfriend singer Kelly Khumalo’s house  in Joburg in October 2014. Earlier this year, Zamokuhle Mbatha filed a lawsuit against Police Minister Bheki Cele and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for wrongful arrest and defamation of character after he was arrested and detained for the murder back in 2014. The papers were filed in the High Court in Johannesburg on May 13 and he is seeking almost R18-million.
