THE police, roads and transport department hosted a rural safety dialogue on Monday. The event at Ladybrand City Hall, Free State, tried to find ways to fight crime in rural and farming communities. It was attended by emerging and commercial farmers, Sars, the Lesotho mounted police service and the police. Mpane Nthunya, the district administrator in Maseru, Lesotho, said: “We have come here today to discuss the burning issue of stock theft which needs special attention. “We have found that lots of cattle are moved between Lesotho and South Africa to be sold by gangs from both countries. You will see cattle with two marks are from Lesotho and when you see them in South Africa, it shows they have been stolen.” He said they have sent soldiers across the border to ensure cattle thieves were not moving stolen animals. “We realised these gangs communicate before they cross the border to make sure no soldiers are around,” he said. Mantsopa municipal mayor Mamsie Tsoene said they would work closely with the police in South Africa and Lesotho to deal with stock theft. Assistant director for cross border crime prevention in the police department, Ditaba Mahapi, said stock theft had reached an alarming rate. “As the department and stakeholders, we are going to stop this organised crime and ensure those responsible are brought to book.”
