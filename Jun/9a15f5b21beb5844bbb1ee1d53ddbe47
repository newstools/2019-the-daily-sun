NOMBEKO Maxwele’s relatives are worried her murder won’t be the last in their family. The 55-year-old and her boyfriend (25) were gunned down at her home in Bhongweni Village, Mthatha, last weekend. The family described Nombeko as a staunch Christian who fought for their chieftaincy to be restored. Her younger brother Baxolele (48) claimed that before her brutal murder, Nombeko and their 77-year-old mum Nokhaya received SMSes threatening to kill them if they continued fighting for the chieftaincy. “I found my sister in a pool of blood,”he said. “Her boyfriend was also dead. We’ll not stop fighting for what’s rightfully ours.” Baxolele said his family lost their chieftaincy years ago when another family claimed it. “We live in fear that I’ll be killed, too. But we want government to recognise us and end this fight,” he said. “My father was mysteriously burned to death, but we’ll die fighting for the truth.” Nokhaya said the death of Nombeko left the family shattered. “I last spoke to her a week ago when she came to check up on me,” Nokhaya said. “The family depended on her, especially me.” The family said Nombeko will be buried tomorrow. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said both victims had gunshot wounds to their upper bodies. “Several 9mm pistol cartridges were found at the scene,” Koena said. “The motive for the killing is not known, and no arrest has been made.” She urged anyone with information to call 0860 10111.
