CAPE Town City have brought on board former Ajax Cape Town striker Tashreeq Morris on a three-year deal. The Citizens have one of the few teams that have been active in this window period, recently they snapped up former Ajax midfielder Abbubaker Mobara who returned to Cape Town from Soweto giants, Orlando Pirates after three seasons with the Sea Robbers. In addition, City has already snatched former Urban Warriors player Travis Graham in their ranks. The 25-year-old Morris has a decent goal-scoring record having hit 25 goals in all competitions during his career with Ajax since 2013/14 both in the Premiership and the National First Division (NFD). The forward also has international experience having featured prominently in South Africa's Under-23 outfit which did the business at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. With the likes of Siphelele Mthembu, Kermit ErasmusÂ  in the Citizens striking force, Morris is already facing a tough competition and will need to work extra hard to break it into the starting line-up.
