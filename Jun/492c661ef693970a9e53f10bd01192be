RICHARD Sekgobo is starting to suspect that Home Affairs wants him to die without having ID. The 71-year-old from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he lost his ID in 1988. When he went to Home Affairs in Edenvale, they told him they couldn’t read his fingerprints. He said he even brought an affidavit, but they still couldn’t help him. He said it hurt to see other madalas getting pension grants while he survives on recycling. “Even madalas younger than I am are pensioners,” he said. “I’m really old and this is making my life really hard.” Richard said he lives with his girlfriend and it hurt him that he couldn’t support her. “At least she has a pension, but the problem is that I’m a man and should be there for her. How do I do this when I’m broke?” he said. Richard said he has no kids, but if he were to die he’d feel like a failure. His girlfriend Elizabeth Lekgahlela (70) said she hates Home Affairs for failing her man. She said she had been up and down trying to get him help, but with no success. “All they tell us is that the system doesn’t recognise his fingerprints and will investigate and get back to us. We’re still waiting,” said Elizabeth. Home Affairs’ Thabo Mokgola said the matter was referred to a provincial manager.  “We’ll contact him to get more information.”
