 BMW has finally unveiled the all-new 8-Series Gran Coupé, it
is the car that sits atop of the BMW range, the big daddy. What it is, is BMW’s 8-Series Coupé with two extra doors and
enough space in the back to sit two adults and not just little people. The Gran Coupé is, for the most part, the same under the
skin as the normal coupé. In Mzansi it will be offered with three engine options.
There's the M850i xDrive which is a 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 with 390kW
and a healthy 750Nm of torque, the 840i is a 3.0-litre in-line six with 250kW
and then there's the 840d xDrive with 236kW. All models use an 8-Speed automatic transmission. The M850i
xDrive will do 0-100 km/h in 3.9 seconds. Whilst the rear wheel drive 840i will
do it in a respectable 5.2 seconds and the 3.0-litre oil burner will do it in
5.1 seconds thanks to xDrive. The Gran Coupé is only 70kg heavier than the normal coupé.
It has a wheelbase that is 201mm longer than the two-door.  The car is 231mm longer than the coupe. All that extra
length goes to give rear occupants real leg room. The roofline is also 61mm
higher to give the rear occupants some headroom. The interior is basically the same as the normal coupé.
Upfront you find the 12.3-inch digital instrumentation cluster and a
touch-sensitive 10.25-inch infotainment screen.  The screen both run off iDrive 7.0, so there's "Hey
BMW" voice control, Gesture Control, the trusted rotary dial and
touchscreen to control the tech. There's the optional crystal gear selector with illuminated
8 on it, a must have. The centre console extends to the back. To present the
rear passengers with aircon controls. So, the car is a 4 +1 set up.  There are essentially two main seats than can sit adults
whereas the +1 seat is just place for a small person.  BMW insists that the 8-Series Gran Coupé is a sports car. So,
they have worked the standard fit adaptive dampers to ensure that the car
delivers the sporty drive. To further enhance cornering abilities there's an option of
active roll stabilisation. The M Sport diff is standard on the M850i xDrive and
optional for the other cars. The xDrive models also get four-wheel steering as
standard. The 8-Series Gran Coup arrives in Mzansi in the 4th quarter
of the year. It will be followed by the M8 Gran Coupe.
