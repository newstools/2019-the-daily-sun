THEY were praying on Tuesday night when something fell onto the roof with a heavy noise. When the family looked through the window, they saw a chicken rolling on the ground. But the chicken attacked Sizzy Mnisi-Seoke (27) and her three children! Sizzy from Kumani in Mpumalanga said the chicken scratched them with its feet as it flew over their heads. “But it fell on the ground as I was praying,” said Sizzy. Her daughter Mahlogonolo (11) said the chicken whistled and struggled to fly towards them. “But mum urged us to pray and it staggered around and died. It was horrible,” she said. Shocked neighbour Master Mathebula (41) said they were woken up by noise as Sizzy fought the chicken. “I ran out with neighbours and we could not believe our eyes. “At the time the chicken was struggling to fly. Sizzy was praying and shouting at it. “It later died and it was clear someone evil had sent it to test her. “We quickly sprinkled petrol over the dead chicken and set it alight so the sender would follow it.” Traditional healer Annuary Ndlovu advised the family to pray. “Evil people are likely to use things like chickens or cats to fight people they’re jealous of. So they should continue to pray,” he said.
