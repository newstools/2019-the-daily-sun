THE National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) members
say over 200 miners are struggling to get food underground. NUMSA members have been staging a sit-in since last week Wednesday
protesting against sexual harassment at Lanxess Mine in Bleskop, outside
Rustenburg, North West. Today, it was confirmed by one of the workers from
underground that they are dehydrated and had nothing to eat. The miner also said two miners were taken to the surface for
treatment as a result. "Some of the miners have had to be treated either
on-site or at a hospital. Part of the problem is that management of Lanxess
Mine refuses to allow NUMSA to bring food to the premises, to allow for food to
be taken down to the minors," said the miner. "The condition inside is really bad and unbearable. We
are suffocating, dehydrated and weak. We only have water to drink with no food
provided," the miner added. The miners reportedly last had food on Monday night. Itâ€™s alleged that on Tuesday, food was prevented from going
in bought by NUMSA. Miners said they will remain underground until their demand to
reinstate about 50 employees is met. In an effort to deal with the issue Lanxess Mine said they
have supplied the underground workers with electrolytes and medical nutrition. In a statement released by the mine, it stated that it is
calling on NUMSA leaders to stop the strike as stated by the Labour Court
interdict. "Despite repeated offers by Lanxess mine to provide
food and medical aid at the surface, the strikers have not left the mine." "Moreover, it was reported that the food supplied to
strikers by NUMSA was only shared with selected workers," the mine said.
