ITUMELENG Letsepe (41) told the court she was sorry for the actions that led to her arrest on 22 February 2019. She pleaded guilty to a charge of assault with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Letsepe was arrested after beating up a teacher at Leema Primary School gates in Tlhatlhaganyane outside Rustenburg with a weapon resembling a stick. It was after the accused's son came home crying and said the teacher, Mpuseng Sepotokele (53), had slapped her for hitting a window with a ball. In an affidavit read out in the Mankwe Magistrates Court in Mogwase on Thursday, her legal representative Letsepe said she realises her actions had caused harm to the teacher. Letsepe said she acted out because of her son who had refused to go to school on that day (22 February 2019) saying the teacher (Mpuseng Sepotokele) is going to beat him. According to Letsepe her son said he faces physical abuse from Sepotokele on a daily basis. Sepotokele said she could never abuse a child. She has since moved from Leema Primary School to Montsamaisa Primary School in another village. She said she felt unsafe in her previous employment area. Present in court National Provincial Teachers Organisation of South Africa (NAPTOSA) Provincial Chairman Ephraim Ditlopo expressed great concern regarding the safety of learners and teachers at school. "SGBs and teachers should have control of the schools like it used to be. We are not calling for corporal punishment, we are calling for safety. Today we demonstrate that we are not happy about the situations at schools especially the violence," Ditlopo said. The case has been postponed to 25 July 2019 for state to prepare submissions. Letsepe was released on bail of R 2000 in March.
