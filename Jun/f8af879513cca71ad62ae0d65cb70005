He sings: “Yes, we are dating and even you, Jub Jub, you are dating as well. Why are you making it seem like you do not do what we do? “When we should be asking girls out, we are now scared of you because you follow us with cameras. You need to stop what you are doing because it’s going against our plans. You are following a snake inside a hole. You see, Jub Jub.” Jub Jub has a verse in the song too. He asks whether men are afraid of getting caught. He sings: “Why are you complaining? You cheat, I get you and expose you because uyajola 99.” Music fans first found out about the song through a clip on Facebook showing Malinga being held back while confronting someone.
