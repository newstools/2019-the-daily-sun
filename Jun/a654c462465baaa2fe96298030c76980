THE business chamber and ratepayers’ association in Mthatha wants the OR Tambo Municipality to get its house in order. This is after the water supply was cut off in some areas of Mthatha. The supply was allegedly cut off by municipal workers to make their grievances felt. Areas such as Norwood township and Mthatha CBD have been without water since last week. OR Tambo Chamber of Business secretary Andile Nontso said: “Our businesses are under siege. We cannot operate fully. “The whole Mthatha economy is under extreme strain. Toilets are blocked and visitors are not coming due to the water issues.” Sandise Nyembezi, chairman of the South African Municipal Workers Union, said they will meet workers to discuss whether to end the strike or to continue. Acting municipal manager Bongani Matomela said: “Management came up with a plan to pump water. Our operations are in order.”
