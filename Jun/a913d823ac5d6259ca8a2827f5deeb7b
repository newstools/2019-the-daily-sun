In a clip from the brand-new season of his reality show, Somizi is heard talking about his relationship with TV personality Bonang Matheba. The two, who were extremely close a few years back, had a falling out which resulted in their friendship ending. But, it seems all of that is in the past now as Somizi, who attended theÂ launch of Bonang's bubbly House of BNG, says they are "back together". In the short video shared on Twitter, the choreographer is seen at the House of BNG launch, saying: "I'm in the VIP area. Everyone who used to laugh at us is standing outside the VIP area. We are back together now."
