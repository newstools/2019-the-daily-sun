It was not supposed to have been a song in the first place. DJ Njelic was just humming and his friends  loved it. One thing led to another and, before they knew it, a hit song was in the making. Shesha has not only become an instant hit, it has cemented the popularity of amapiano. The chart-topping song, co-produced by DJs Njelic and De Mthuda, has changed the name of the game. Shesha first caught the attention of social media users when the two posted a video while recording it. Njelic, whose real name is Tshwarelo Motlhako (29), told SunBuzz they made the song so catchy they knew it would get people singing along. “I was chilling with the guys when the lyrics came out. These are the same lyrics my sister and I used to casually sing while preparing to go out. To my surprise, the guys loved the song. “I think DJ De Mthuda and I make a great combination. That’s why the song is as good as it sounds,”he said. Njelic’s love of music began while he was a kid. “My gogo was a shebeen queen. Music has always been around me. In that same space I began my DJing career in 2001.” The duo plan to release an album soon. “People have to hear what we have to offer,” he said.
