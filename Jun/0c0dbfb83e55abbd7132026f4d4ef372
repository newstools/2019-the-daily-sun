Hey MizzB I AM 23 years old and have been dating my man for four years. When we met, he was still involved with his baby mama but he said they were not on good terms. The problem now is that she is pregnant with their second child. When I tell him how I feel about the situation, he begs me to be patient as he’s working on it. I’m confused. Should I stay or move on? Hey Gal Relationships can be complicated. It’s wrong to invest in a love affair with a man who doesn’t respect you. It seems this man is not committed to you and you have to decide whether you want to be with him or not. Start loving yourself and learn to walk away from situations and people who don’t build your self-esteem. You really deserve better.
