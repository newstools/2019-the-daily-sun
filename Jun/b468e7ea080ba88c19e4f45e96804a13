 Seven alleged zama zama’s have been arrested in Daveyton in Ekurhuleni. Their mining tools were also seized in the raid. Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) Media Liaison
Officer, Kobeli Mokheseng said seven men were found mining illegally at Chris
Hani extension 1 in Daveyton. Mokheseng said the success came after they responded to a
tip off received from a reliable source.  “The EMPD raided a shack where a 31-year old male was found
mining illegally, before he took officers to a place not far from his hut. Six illegal miners between the ages of 16 and 39 were
cornered with sophisticated mining, welding equipment’s, chemicals and few
portable wash-basins full of processed dust,” said Mokheseng. Mokheseng also said the half dozen were transported to the
Daveyton Police Station with their utensils and charged under illegal mining
Act. “The suspects will appear in the Daveyton Magistrate’s Court
soon,” he added.
