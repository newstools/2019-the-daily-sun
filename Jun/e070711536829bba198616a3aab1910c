MORE than 80 detectives put their lives at risk just by going to work. But they are not living in fear of thugs but of the rundown office building they work in! Employees at the police building in Seshego, Limpopo, told Daily Sun they couldn’t guarantee that dockets kept in the building were safe. Provincial EFF chairman Jossey Buthane called for a safe work environment so cops could do their jobs properly. “The building is a ticking time bomb because anything can happen, at any time,” he said. “It’s our brothers and sisters working in the building, and it concerns us that they’re being exposed to a deadly situation by a government that claims to care for its citizens.” Buthane said it was worrying that random people could just enter and leave the building as there were no guards. “This puts the lives of detectives in real danger. “The main door of the building is broken, and criminals can enter with ease to steal dockets and other sensitive information. “The roof is also leaking, and when it rains officers are forced to control the situation with buckets of water.” Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said management was aware of the situation. He said the building was not endangering lives. “The building is old but not on the verge of collapse,” he said. “Renovations have already been planned and the structure will receive a facelift. “All documents are secure, but there is a need for extra accommodation.” Mojapelo said alternative space for documents and other valuables had already been found.
