RESIDENTS are at each other’s throats over rubbish outside a cemetery. People who live next to Zwide Cemetery, near Port Elizabeth, said their houses buzzed with flies and their yards were full of rubbish. The road to the cemetery’s entrance is also strewn with litter. This is the cemetery where struggle icons such as Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba and the Pebco Three, Qaqawuli Godolozi, Sipho Hashe and Champion Galela, are buried. Anele Klaas (24) said their dignity was taken away. He told Daily Sun: “My brother and I have been fighting other residents who dump rubbish here. We sometimes take up arms and chase them. Those we caught were moered but it did not work,” she said. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “The new co-operatives will form part of a team to target illegal dumpsites, working with rangers who have the power to issue fines to anyone who breaks the law.”
