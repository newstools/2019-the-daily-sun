 Girls say yes to a date for free food with a guy who stands
no chance of being in their life. A new study has revealed that a lot of women go on
dates for free food, even if they’re not interested in the man. A study in the Society for Personality and Social Psychology
journal found that a quarter to a third of women have gone on a date with
a guy they weren’t interested in, just for a free meal. Daily Sun spoke to Sun Readers who agreed that they would
definitely go on a date for free food. Nokubonga Dlamini said she has done it before, and she plans
to continue. “Food is always nicer when someone else pays for it. I don’t
like spending my own money for food,” she said. Nkabetsi Senyolo said yes, she has done it a couple of times
and she’s not willing to stop. “Ordering the most expensive food and enjoying the best ribs,
while you’re not paying always makes my day,” she said. Nkanyi Slay said free food is always nice and she would do
it again and again. “Free things don’t come easy. We’re a hungry nation, I
wouldn’t mind,” said Nkanyi. “Sometimes that free food date could turn into a good
relationship. Go out there and eat,” he added.
