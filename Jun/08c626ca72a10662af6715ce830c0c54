After years of hard work and hustling, Afro pop singer Nela King has finally made a breakthrough. After dropping out of varsity in 2014, the singer, whose real name is Nelani Mahlangu, rose from singing at nightclubs to becoming an instant award winner. Last year she was named the African Social Entertainment Awards’ best female artist category winner for her debut single, Work For You. The single, featuring C-Tea, received rave reviews. It seems the industry cannot get enough of the song because Nela has been nominated in the same category at this year’s awards. She told SunBuzz she couldn’t believe it when she received the award. “It made me realise I was doing the right thing and that I was in the right field,” she said. “I had been trying to record and release music since I was in high school, but with no luck. “Now, when I finally release my debut single, I get an award. This just goes to show God has great plans for us.” Nela from Bronkhorstspruit started her career by nagging club promoters to allow her to perform. The singer released her second single, Show Me The Money, last month. She wants to collaborate with other artists before releasing her debut EP.
