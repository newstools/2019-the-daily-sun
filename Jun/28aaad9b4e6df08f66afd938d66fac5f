President Cyril Ramaphosa says Eskom is left with money that will only sustain it for only four months. He said this during the state of the
nation address in Parliament on Thursday night. “With the current committed
funding from government, outlined in the 2019 Budget, Eskom has sufficient cash
to meet its obligations until the end of October 2019,” Ramaphosa said. He
added that a new CEO of the Eskom is expected to be announced soon after
Phakamani Hadebe stepped down last month after only one year at the helm of Eskom.
Ramaphosa said Eskom has to be saved, failure to do so many have dire
consequences. “ For Eskom to default on its loans will cause a cross-default on
its remaining debt and would have a huge impact on the already constrained
fiscus.We will therefore table a Special Appropriation Bill on an urgent basis
to allocate a significant portion of the R230 billion fiscal support that Eskom
will require over the next 10 years in the early years. This we must do because
Eskom is to vital to our economy to be allowed to fail,”  added Ramaphosa. The package to rescue Eskom
will be announced by minister of Finance Tito Mboweni. To bring stability to
the organisation a Chief Restructuring Officer would be appointed to bring back
the energy providing company back to its feet. “We will soon also be appointing a Chief Restructuring
Officer, who will be expected to reposition Eskom financially with careful
attention to the mix between revenue, debt and cost structure of the
company,”  said Ramaphosa. He said the
government is going to ensure that people pay for the electricity they use. “
Eskom is working with government and other stakeholders to address its overall
debt as well the debt owed by municipalities and individual users. As a
country, we must assert the principle that those who use electricity must pay
for it,”  he said.
