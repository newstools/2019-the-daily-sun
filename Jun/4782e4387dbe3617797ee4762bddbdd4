THE Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) arrested a VW Golf 6 who
was travelling at 236km/h on the N2 near Mandeni. The KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and
Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda commended the cops for the arrest. Kaunda said the 34-year-old man is facing three charges of
speeding, drinking and driving as well as failing to stop. He is expected to appear in court tomorrow. “Early this year, we issued a clear directive to our law
enforcement officers to clamp down on speeding, as well as drinking and
driving. So far, I am pleased that our operations are yielding positive results,”
said Kaunda. He said the latest arrest will send a strong message to
other road users that KwaZulu-Natal is a zero-tolerance province. “Anyone who breaks the law in this province will spend time
in jail. Therefore, let us all abide by the rules of the road so that we can
save lives,” said Kaunda.
