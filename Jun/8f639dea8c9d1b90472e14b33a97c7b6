LUC Eymael, the Tala ea El Gaish SC coach in Egypt, has rejected a R100 000 monthly salary offer from Black Leopards. The club had apparently offered him the package to take charge of the Limpopo-based Absa Premiership club. Leopards are looking for a new coach before the 2019-20 season gets underway in August after the departure of Dylan Kerr, who left at the end of last season. In a interview with SunSport yesterday, the Belgium-born Eymael explained that he had turned down Lidoda Duvha as they couldn’t meet his financial demands. Explains the former Free State Stars coach: “I didn’t agree with Leopards because of what they were offering to me.” He said what Lidoda Duvha put on the table wasn’t what he was looking for. Leopards were said to have offered him a R100 000 salary, which he says was not sufficient. He added: “I wanted the same contract I had with Free State Stars (2017-18 season), but what they offered me was far less than that. In fact, it was very far from what I earned at Stars. That is why I didn’t agree to join Leopards.” Eymael, who is in demand, previously coached Polokwane City in the 2016-17 season. The following season he won the Nedbank Cup for the now relegated Ea LIa Koto in 2018. Other coaches that have been linked with Leopards include Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba.
