A CAR WASH owner allegedly promised to pay Themba Mashaba (20) R15, but ended up stabbing him instead. Now his shocked family wants his killer to get a long sentence. The incident happened at Thembisa in Pienaar, Mpumalanga on Saturday. Themba’s friend, who was with him at the time, told Daily Sun they washed cars on Saturday and waited for their payment when they were done. But the owner told them he would give them their money later. “We went back a little later to demand our payment but he became aggressive. He and Themba started to argue. He went to his house and came back carrying a knife. He then started stabbing Themba.” Themba was allegedly stabbed in the chest and back. He died instantly. His aunt Doris Mdluli (42) said: “My nephew died a painful death. I don’t sleep at night thinking about what happened. “Who knew he would be killed for R15? Even though I don’t work, I would have tried to give him the R15 he wanted.” Doris said the family was heartbroken, especially his mum. “We believed he would take care of us when he finished school. This is a great loss for everyone,” she said. Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said they were investigating a case of murder. He said a 28-year-old man was arrested and would appear in court soon.
