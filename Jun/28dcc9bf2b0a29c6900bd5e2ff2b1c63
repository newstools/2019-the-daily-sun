PHUMZA Ntamo wants justice after she opened a case against her cousin last year. The 33-year-old from Boomplaas, Eastern Cape, said she was visiting her uncle when her cousin came into the room and insulted them. “When no one paid attention to what he was saying, he pointed at me and said he was talking to me,” said Phumza. She was allegedly stabbed on her hands. “I would have died if I had not fought him. One of my fingers is still not healed.” She said she opened a case against her cousin after the incident. “The cops only took statements from the witnesses and never arrested him. I have been going to the police station to inquire about my case, but I am being sent from pillar to post by the investigating officer.” Phumza said the suspect ran away from his home. “I’m begging Police Minister Bheki Cele to do something about the case because something is not right at that police station. I want justice and cops are not helping me at all,” she said. Police spokesman Captain Khaya Tonjeni said the case was still under investigation. “The investigating officer has exhausted all avenues looking for clues, but with no success,” said Tonjeni. “The case was assigned to a new detective after the one who was handling it was promoted. Police appeal to members of the community who might have information to come forward. No arrest has been made at this stage.”
