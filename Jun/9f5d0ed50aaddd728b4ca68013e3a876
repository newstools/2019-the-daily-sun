CAPE Town train users can only wait and hope that the promises made by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula will be fulfilled after he took a train ride with them this morning. Mbaks took a packed train from Khayelitsha to Langa and interacted with passengers who told stories of endless delays and crime on the railways. Speaking after the bumpy ride, Mbaks said he was willing to speak to Police Minister Bheki Cele to fix the issue of railway police. “I know his issue is money for that. Siyawadinga ama polisa azo betha u tsotsi!” “Aba tsotsi abazuyeka  ugeza! Abazuyeka  uthath’inkunzi! Kufuneka sibatyumze!” (Tsotsis won’t stop mugging people! We need to destroy them!)   He further said, “It will need well trained men and women. I will bring new trains but they will need to be protected.” Mbalula tweeted about the worrying state of the train describing it as a “skeleton of its former self due to vandalism and theft. We will increase safety on trains and protection of trains. Crime must fall and must end.” He also acknowledged the cries of the people saying, “I am here now and we will come back. We will address this issue.”
