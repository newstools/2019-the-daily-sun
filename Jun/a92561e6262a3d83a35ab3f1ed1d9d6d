ON FRIDAY, a family had a close brush with death when a car flew off the road and crashed into a wall near a house. The driver of the VW Jetta was apparently driving at high speed on Malandela Road in KwaMashu K section, north of Durban, when he suddenly lost control of his car. A witness said: “I saw the car fly off the road and straight into the wall. It almost crashed into cars parked in the yard. “Luckily no one was injured and there were no cars on the road.” A family member said they were shocked when the car hit the wall. “I was doing something at the back of the house when I heard the sound and rushed to see what had happened. “I then saw the car had crashed into our wall,” he said. He said they spoke to the driver, who said he was from Newlands West. He said as he was still young, his parents would fix the wall. “We are waiting for the parents to come and fix the wall. Although they didn’t give us an exact date, they said it would happen soon,” he said.
