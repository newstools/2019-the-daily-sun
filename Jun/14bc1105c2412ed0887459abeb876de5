Artist Emtee has created the hashtag #FreeEmtee, and he is not in jail but to him it feels like it. Emtee is signed under Ambitiouz Entertainment record label which has an unfortunate history of making artists feel like they are in Prison. The #FreeEmtee hashtag is Emtee’s desperate cry for help, and he took it to social media to get support from his fans. “I know my supporters want me prosper #FreeEmtee” Mtee wrote. A few artists seem to have been aware of Emtee’s unhappiness at the record label. “you can not even be your ultimate self as an artist in the record label because you are marginalized” These are a few words that A-Reece shared while speaking to Pearl Thusi on the show, Behind the story. Emtee’s fans are 100% behind him, hoping that Emtee will be free!!
