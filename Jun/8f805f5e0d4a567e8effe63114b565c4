A truck belonging to Mogalakwena Municipality was burnt on Saturday night. The incident came after a fight which broke out on Tuesday in a council meeting which left mayor Andrina Matsemela injured. The brawl contiued on Wednesday, leading to 25 people being arrested. Municipal spokesman Malesela Selokela couldn’t confirm if the damaged truck and the fight were linked. He said the truck was discovered on Sunday morning. “A truck worth R2 million belonging to the department of community service was set alight on Saturday night at about 10pm. “The reason behind this terrorist behaviour has not yet been identified but a case was opened with the Mokopane police for investigations. No arrest has been made.” The truck had apparently been taken to town for maintenance when the security fence was cut and the truck set alight. “Police are aware the area is volatile. They have promised to continuously monitor it and work around the clock to make arrests,” he said. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed a case was opened and said cops were investigating. “At this point we are not sure if the truck was burnt on purpose or if it just caught fire. Our investigations will reveal everything. “We cannot link last week’s scuffle which took place in the municipal council to the burning of the truck,” Ngoepe said.
