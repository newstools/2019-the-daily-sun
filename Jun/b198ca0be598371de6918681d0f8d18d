TWO Pre-school learners have died allegedly from rat poison in Westdene,
Joburg. It is alleged that the two
learners were under the care and supervision of a privately-run pre-school
without the necessary permits to care for kids. The area is apparently infested
with pre-schools that are operated illegally. Speaking to Daily Sun, Police
Spokesman Captain Jerbes de Bruyn confirmed that that two children
have died from poison. “The postmortem shows that it was poison that killed the children.” But he said it is unclear what kind of poison killed them they are
waiting for a toxic report which will give a clear indication what kind of
poison is behind the death of these two young children. “An inquest case was register with Sophiatown SAPS, and it is being
investigated,” he said. Tomorrow, MMC of health in
Joburg Mpho Phalatse is expected to visit the families of the two children with
the cops to get to the bottom of this. Phalatse will be accompanied by
City officials in Social Development, including social workers, the City’s
Child Desk, Environmental Health, the Emergency Management Services and
Local Ward Councillors.
