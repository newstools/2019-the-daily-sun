THEY have been living in the dark for three weeks and they are tired of it! Tshepo Mokhele (40) from Protea South in Soweto told Daily Sun this has been going on since 2017. “The transformer is shared between shacks and houses. I told Eskom their transformer was too small but they just gave me a reference number,” said Tshepo. He said their internal electrical boxes no longer took vouchers so community members connected them illegally. “The guys took the law into their own hands because Eskom did not take us seriously. We are tired of living without lights.” Tshepo said they went to the local Eskom office on Tuesday but the police were called. “Eskom’s employees told us we were stupid in front of the police and left us standing there. We were also told there are no transformers and they can’t help us. People are angry and frustrated,” he said. A resident said the food she has bought for her children has rotted away. “Before the schools closed, children had to bath after school because the water is too cold in the morning,” she said. Daily Sun sent an email inquiry to Eskom’s media desk on Wednesday and the team promised to get back to the People’s Paper yesterday. However, they had not responded at the time of going to print.
