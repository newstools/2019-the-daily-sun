COPS have been hunting for a suspect with a piece of his nose missing! The suspect in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State, and a friend allegedly tried to break into a church on Saturday, but they were caught by a security guard. They demanded the church keys and a fight apparently broke out. The guard stood his ground and the thugs then fled the scene. But not before biting off a piece of one of the suspect’s nose! The guard was taken to hospital to be treated for injuries to his fingers. A concerned resident told the SunTeam that thugs had started targeting places of worship and even used kids when committing their crimes. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said: “On Saturday at about 3am, the security guard was on duty when two suspects attempted to break into the church. “After the fight broke out, he managed to bite the suspect’s nose and removed a piece, which he later found on the ground. The suspect bit the guard’s fingers but couldn’t stand the pain of his nose and fled. “A case of attempted robbery was opened and any person with information about the two suspects should contact the Phuthaditjhaba Police Station on 058 718 0895/6/7. Mophiring also warned residents not to buy stolen goods. “We have learned that children are being used to commit break-ins at residential and business premises daily to sell in exchange for money or drugs. “Let’s stop criminals and give information to the police,” Mophiring said.
