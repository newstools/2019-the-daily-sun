FNB was voted Mzansi’s coolest bank for the eighth year in a row. On Tuesday, the bank showed why it’s cool. This is because clients suddenly received money in their accounts! Some were happy when they saw their big balances. People took to social media to brag about their caring bank, which gave them money for free. However, their happiness was short-lived as the bank quickly realised the mistake and said the money would be reversed. The bank’s transitional banking spokesman, Daniel Kaan, yesterday said the issue had been resolved. “The incorrect balances were due to delayed debit card transactions for purchases by impacted customers. Due to client confidentiality, we will be communicating directly with those customers,” said Kaan. He apologised for the inconvenience. People soon took to social media to express their disappointment.
