On Sunday morning
Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the family of 28-year-old Constable Nhlamulo
Vukeya who was shot and killed in the line of duty, during an operation at
Nancefield Hostels in Soweto on Thursday, 20 June 2019. Addressing the
family Cele expressed his condolences to the family. He also expressed
disappointment at how the family found out about Nhlamulo's passing. Hlamulani
Vukeya (31), said that she was hurt finding out about her brother's passing on social
media and strangers. "I was the last person to know. People were calling
me, sending me questions on Whatsapp about the incident. Meanwhile, my other
brother who is also an officer, who even went to the scene to cordon it off was
not told about it. He heard on the police radio after he was at the
scene," Hlamulani said. "I am so
cross, why didn't they tell him while he was at the scene. He had to hear it on
the police radio while he was driving," Hlamulani said. Speaking to the
media, Cele said that they are investigating how the incident got out so fast
and hit social media. Cele said that they are looking at setting up a trust for
police orphans of officers who died while on duty. Cele said that three people
had been arrested for the incident. "I would wish that people who are
arrested for killing an officer be given a treason trial. It should be a crime
against the State," Cele said.
