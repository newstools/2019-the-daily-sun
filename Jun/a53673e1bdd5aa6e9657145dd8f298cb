THE streets of Cape Town roared with Red Bull's F1 car over the weekend. This after Formula 1 David Coulthard got behind the wheel and thrilled local fans with the car. The Formula 1 Experience is a Red Bull Cape Town Circuit which is a free event that gave thousands of Mazansi fans the chance to witness the thundering power of a Formula 1 car. However, Coulthard didn’t know that In Mzansi, a taxi can be as fast – if not faster than a Formula 1 car. In the video, the Formula 1 car can be seen racing with the taxi on a traffic circle in the City Centre in Cape Town.
