MARITZBURG United chairman Farook Kadodia has challenged Keagan Buchanan to step up his game next season. This is because Maritzburg will be short of attacking talent this coming season after they sold Siphesihle Ndlovu and Fortune Makaringe, their two key players to Orlando Pirates in the off-season. Maritzburg had a 2018-19 season to forget just managing to avoid relegation. Said Kadodia: “I only hope he can resurrect his (Buchanan) football career and the investment and sacrifices the club made and that he gives us back the kind of performances that we expect from him.” Buchanan, who joined the Team of Choice at beginning of last season after he was dumped by Kaizer Chiefs, played just three matches in all competitions. His season was sadly cut short after he injured his knee ligaments in September at training. He was forced to miss the rest of the season. Kadodia added: “Buchanan has been given a clean bill of health by the medical team and that he’ll be back for the pre-season training.” The 28-year-old, who was looking to rekindle his career with United, has been posting videos of himself working hard with the club’s physios , an indication that when the 2019-20 season gets underway, he’ll be fit. During his two seasons at Naturena, he was handed the number 10 jersey, the famous number in the world football, Buchanan was also hampered by injuries at Amakhosi. The Midlands club survived the relegation axe by retaining their PSL status via the play-offs after winning all four matches, becoming the first club to do so. In the 2017-18 season, the club had a fantastic campaign, where they broke many of their records. This included finishing fourth and reaching the final of the Nedbank Cup.
