 The City of Joburg distances itself from what seems to be a road sign that has been trending on twitter through out the weekend.This sign shows a person pulling a huge bag on a trolley of what seems to be recycling things and people were unhappy about this. “Banning recyclers in the middle of a global environmental crisis is very orderly. Especially when you don’t have any working alternative in place and will run out of landfill space in the next four years. Oh wait the cbd resembles a landfill!

Unless you have an alternative, stop this behaviour. Privilege makes people insensitive to the poor and what they need.” said Mlungisi. Lindani Mnguni said there are no jobs, the environment is filthy, these chaps are cleaning and making a buck in the process.
