TWO former
AMCU members were sentenced in the Gauteng North High Court, on charges of
attempted murder, murder, possession of illegal firearm and ammunition. SAMKELO
Mkhutshwa (38) was sentenced to 80 years in jail while Siphiwe Silwane (36) was
sentenced to 95 years. The two,
both from Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape, had pleaded not guilty to the
charges. Last week,
the deputy chairperson of one of the Amcu branches, Malibongwe Mdazo who was
shot 16 times but survived, took the stand to testify in the trial. The
prosecution withdrew charges against their co-accused, Xolile Madikane,
Mthethelethi Tshubuka, Zambelekhaya Mboxela, Zithobile Mangqo, Bongile Cingo
and Siyanda Sinqina due to lack of evidence against them. The accused
were believed to be some of the kingpins behind the spate of attacks in
Marikana in 2017. On July 22,
2017, Mkutshwa and Silwane allegedly went to the soccer stadium at Mooinooi
where they were informed Mdazo would be. He was
about to leave the stadium after the match when he was shot at while inside his
vehicle. The hail of
bullets continued even after he got out. However, he managed to run away. He told the
court that after the soccer game, he walked to his car, where he spoke to a
friend. “I got into
my car and adjusted the driver's seat when I heard noises which sounded like
crackers. I then realised I was being shot at and I jumped out of the car to see
what was happening,” he said. Mdazo
suffered several bullet wounds across his body and had to remain in hospital
for a long time.
