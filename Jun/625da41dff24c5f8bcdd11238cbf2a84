PEOPLE are rallying behind Ambassador Zindzi Mandela after a Twitter storm. Mandela lashed out at what she called apartheid apologists in a series of tweets. Critics said her comments were unsuitable for an ambassador, while others praised her. Mandela tweeted: “Dear apartheid apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs. “I’m not accountable to any white man or woman for my views. No missus or baas here. Get over yourselves #OurLand.” AfriForum has called for Mandela to be recalled as ambassador to Denmark, leading to people supporting her, including Black First Land First. The party said: “At a time where rightwing fascism thrives globally, as well as in the SA political space, Mandela is censored because her views do not fit with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s pro-white capital status quo.” The Nelson Mandela Foundation apparently said it would ask Mandela for a meeting to discuss the remarks. #HandsoffZindziMandela trended on Sunday, with Mandela’s supporters in full cry. Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina tweeted: “If she addressed us in the ‘80s on behalf of her father at the height of apartheid, what is difficult in 2019 about airing her views on the land issue which we resolved as ANC? The land belongs to us.” International Relations spokesman Lunga Ngqengelele said they were trying to contact Mandela to check if she really said what was reported. “Until we speak to her, we can’t comment.”
