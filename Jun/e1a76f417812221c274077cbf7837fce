NURSES at Motherwell Clinic in Port Elizabeth are living in fear. Many of them have apparently narrowly escaped attacks in recent months. A nurse told Daily Sun: “Last month a psychiatric patient tried to stab a nurse. “And on Saturday a patient assaulted a nurse and two security guards while he was being treated for a stab wound. “We’re very scared and worried about further attacks, especially over weekends. “Some patients come here drunk while others want to finish their fights in the clinic. We appeal to the department to assist.” Eastern Cape health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo condemned Saturday’s incident. “The department will offer counselling to affected staff,” he said. “The attack didn’t happen because of a security breach. “The nurse was attacked by the patient while his stab wound was being treated.” Kupelo said the department won’t tolerate violence from patients and would call the police. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “A 16-year-old was arrested on Saturday for assaulting a nurse. “He was transferred to Nerina House Juvenile Court because he’s a minor. Social workers will decide on his future.”
