RESIDENTS say the two kids who burnt to death in a shack were locked in and alone. Neighbours in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, tried to put out the fire but it was too late and the two died on Sunday. Jane Siriya (5) and Zandile Tshabangu (8) were burned beyond recognition. Community leader Shadrack Sunduza said the woman who left the two alone could have been drunk. Residents blamed their relatives. “How could they leave such small children alone? They should be bust.” Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said a case was opened and cops are investigating. He said kids shouldn’t be left alone in case of fire.
