AFTER 27 years, Makhosi Khoza has hung up his mic. The legendary radio DJ said he wanted to pursue other avenues in the radio industry. Makhosi, who recently joined Gagasi FM as a DJ trainer, has worked for East Coast Radio, Radio 2000, Durban Youth Radio and Radio 702 over the years. He was among the first DJs at Gagasi when it was started more than 10 years ago. Makhosi told Daily Sun that, when he started his career, he didn’t expect to be a DJ for this long. “Having been on air for 27 years, it’s an achievement for me. I feel like a real legend. “I became a radio DJ because I loved it. I loved hosting shows, but as time went by I realised there were many opportunities behind the decks. “That’s why I decided to hang up the mic and help other DJs develop their skills. I’m still looking at other things in radio.” He said it was time to develop himself. “I don’t only think about my present, but my future as well. “I want to do big things related to radio.”
