THE men of South Africa have spoken: they will NOT wear crop tops. This comes after crop tops for men made by an American clothing company went viral on the internet last month. Asked on Facebook whether they’d be following the new fashion, SunLanders gave a firm no.  “Have you ever see a man wearing a panty? This fashion is out of order.” However, it was not just men who were outraged by the trend. A number of women said they would dump their boyfriends if they saw them wearing crop tops. Fashion designer Paledi “Palse” Segapo told Daily Sun although he didn’t think the trend would be big in Mzansi, there would be a small market for it. “If there’s demand, there will be supply. “Trends are always segmented into groups. “You don’t expect someone with a mkhaba or someone in their 40s or 50s to wear a crop top.” Artist Sithemebele D’s photograph in a mesh tank top also when viral this week.
