By AARON DUBE  MINISTER of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, conducted an in-loco
inspection and released a Preliminary Report from the Railway Safety Regulator
following a collision of a new commuter blue train and Temping Machine.  The incident left 64 commuters on the train and 2 crew
members from the temping machine suffering minor to moderate injuries.  Minister Fikile Mbalula said: "The Railway Safety
Regulator has concluded a preliminary investigation to establish the root cause
of the incident."  Mbalula addressing the media at Wolmerton Train Depot in
Rosslyn, Tshwane on Wednesday said the report says the Transnet temping machine failed at the
Greenview Station and lost its brakes causing it to accelerate on the track
towards the Eerste Fabrieke Station in Mamelodi, Tshwane. "Poor communication between the crew of the temping
machine and the Centralised Train Control centre failed," he said.  "The report also noted that the signalling system
between Eerste Fabrieke and Pienaarspoort Stations has not been functional for
almost two years.”  The Minister said it was a serious matter of concern because
of the heightened risk of manual authorisation.  He said due to the preliminary investigation report it
showed that the train crew performed their duties with diligence, calm and
professionalism and avoided more injuries.  "I'm concerned at the findings that commuters
interfered with the safety operation of the train by activating the passenger
emergency alarm when the driver tried to move the train backwards to avoid
collision.”  "It is also shocking that the commuters ignored the
driver's instruction to move the train which resulted into injuries that could
have been avoided”,he added. He said working together and respecting safety protocols in
railways can save lives.  "The operators have a responsibility to ensure the
infrastructure and rolling stock are adequately maintained and repaired,"
he said.
