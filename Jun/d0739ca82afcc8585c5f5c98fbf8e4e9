ON FRIDAY, seven-year-old Banele left a drawing on his desk at school. It shows a fire truck outside his home with sparks next to it. On the drawing, inside the house, his family are sleeping, his mum sharing the bedroom with her three kids. The next day was Banele Mcira’s birthday, but that night, tragedy struck the family home in Zola, Soweto. Banele’s aunt Nombulelo Mkhosi (31), who was sleeping in the lounge, told Daily Sun she went to sleep at midnight with the plan of waking up and singing happy birthday for her nephew who would be turning seven. But instead she woke up to a burning house.  “I woke up with the house on fire. My sister and her three children were sleeping in the bedroom,” she said. “I rushed into the room to wake them.” She ran to the kitchen door and called for her brother to come and help. “I realised the people hadn’t followed me from the bedroom. We went back into the house but the fire had spread and we couldn’t go in.” “We went around the house. My sister broke the window and tried to take the kids out one by one.”  Nombulelo said when it was time for Banele to be rescued, he ran into the dining room. “He didn’t scream. He just disappeared into the fire. We tried to put it out but we knew what was left of the boy would cause us severe pain.”  Later they found Banele’s burnt body underneath a couch. When they went to his school to report his death, the teacher gave them the drawing. “She took out the drawing he made on Friday and said that Banele explained to her what would happen. “I couldn’t believe he drew the fire and his death before it happened.”
