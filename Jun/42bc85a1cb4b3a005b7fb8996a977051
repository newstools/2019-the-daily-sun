JURGEN Klopp’s Liverpool will lift the curtain on the new Premier League season against Norwich with Manchester United against Chelsea in what has been termed “Super Friday” on 9 August. Tottenham will also face a promoted side in the form of play-off winners Aston Villa on 10 August. Newcastle host Arsenal before Chelsea play Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first “Super Sunday” of the season on 11 August. Premier League champions Manchester City begin their title defence away at West Ham also on 10 August, with Pep Guardiola’s side to meet Liverpool at Anfield on 9 November – before the return at the Etihad on 4 April 2020. Liverpool, who missed out on the title by a single point on the final day of last season, face a tough end to the new campaign, away at Arsenal (2 May), at home to Chelsea (9 May) and then away at Newcastle on 17 May. Manchester City finish with Bournemouth at home (2 May), Watford away (9 May) and Norwich at home on the final day. Some of the top teams will take part in the Premier League Asia Trophy next month, as well as the FA Community Shield. For the first time this season the Premier League will have a mid-season break. Five matches will be played on 8 February and the other five on 15 February. That split will be confirmed in December when the official broadcaster, Sky Sports, picks are announced.
