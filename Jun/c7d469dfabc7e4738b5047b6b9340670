 PLUCKY Banyana Banyana have been knocked out in the last-32 of the Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. Banyana suffered a slight 1-0 defeat against China on Thursday night at Parc des Princes Stadium in France. This was their second defeat of the tournament following a 3-1 thrashing in hands of Spain in the opening match last Saturday in Le Havre. It was another brave performance from Banyana despite not creating enough chances for the attacking players. Banyana only managed a single shot on target in the game. China’s forward Li Ying caught Banyana’s defence napping with five minutes before the break and punished them from a cross. A lot was expected from coach Desiree Ellis charges after a great display in their World Cup match against Spain. However, against the Steel Roses the performance dropped a bit and there were not many chances that were created. Coach Ellis made four changes to her starting line-up, bringing in goalkeeper Kaylin Swart, defenders Bambanani Mbane and Sibulele Holweni, and midfielder Mamello Makhabane. Germany is leading group B after collecting six points from two 1-0 victories over China and Spain respectively. With a game remaining in the group stages Banyana are languishing at the bottom of the group without a point. Spain and China and second and third with three points each. Banyana could still progress to the next round with a victory over Germany in their final group match on Monday, but they would need  to rely on other results to go their way and it seems highly unlikely.
