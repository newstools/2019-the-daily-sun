PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa’s statue at Matsila Royal House had social media users in stitches at the weekend. Some said sculptor Avhatakali Mulaudzi was even worse than Rasta. Many joked that the statue in Makhado, Limpopo, looked more like Wallet from SABC1’s Skeem Saam than the president. Others said it looked like Ramaphosa had flu and was sneezing. But Avhatakali said he was not worried about the criticism, and knew what he was doing as he had been a sculptor for 21 years. “People on social media compare me to Rasta because we both have dreadlocks. But I follow my vision as a sculptor and I love my work,” he said. Limpopo Arts and Culture MEC Thandi Moraka urged people to support Avhatakali. She commented on the matter after social media users said she recently unveiled the statue, even though she knew it didn’t look like the president. “How could I unveil a statue of the president without his involvement? I went to Matsila to support a sport initiative organised by the chief and his royal kraal,” she said.
