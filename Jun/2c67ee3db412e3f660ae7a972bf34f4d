ARE you struggling to keep your man happy? Thanks to Durban prophet Mzwandile Mavula (45), Mzansi women can share their problems and get relationship tips from Ladies House, a social media group made up only of women. It was started three years ago and now has over 202 000 members. Mzwandile told Daily Sun he learned a lot about what women go through while working at a gender commission. “This is why I started Ladies House. “This is not my first group. “I have another that consists of men and women. There I give muthi advice and how partners can keep each other happy,” Mzwandile said. He said he started Ladies House as women weren’t always comfortable discussing their problems when they knew men were listening. “I wanted to create a safe place for women. I have received a lot of positive feedback so far,” he said. Mzwandile posts advice like what to do if your man gets irritated when you talk to him or what to do to make sure your punani is on fire during poking. “For example, if your man no longer enjoys sex, all you need is a cup full of Stoney cold drink and black Halls sweets. “Mix them together and put them in the microwave. Drink the mixture while it’s still hot,” he said. There’s also muthi to make your man call you daily. Mzwandile said he even had testimonies from South African women who live in the UK and Kenya. He said many of them wanted to have personal consultations but they lived too far away. “Some of them even send me money just to say thank you for the remedies. “My aim is to make women happy. It is my job as a healer, and it’s not to make money from it,” Mzwandile said.
