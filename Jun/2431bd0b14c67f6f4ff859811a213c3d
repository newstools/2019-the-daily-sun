PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has threatened to take SACP deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila to court. She said she wanted Mapaila to provide proof after he called her a hired gun in ANC faction fighting or withdraw his comments. SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo said Mapaila had not received any correspondence about this. On Wednesday, Mapaila told National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union members at their conference in Ekurhuleni: “We want to call on the public protector not to allow that important office to be used as a hired gun of the corporate capture agenda.” Yesterday, ANC chairman Gwede Mantashe said at the conference that Mkhwebane sometimes went into political areas with her investigations, mentioning her investigation into a Bosasa donation to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s campaign to become ANC president. Mkhwebane said: “It must be remembered it was Mapaila’s party, the SACP, which after the release of the Nkandla report in 2014, ran down Thuli Madonsela.” She said it was common knowledge that Madonsela was later seen to have been in the right, saying it was Mapaila himself who wrote a blog accusing Madonsela’s office of thinking it was above democratic institutions. Her office said: “Mapaila’s latest attacks on the office, seen against the party’s contempt for the office of the public protector, are based on the unproven report that Mkhwebane is involved in the governing party’s factional battles.”
