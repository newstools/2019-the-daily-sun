MEC for Health in KZN, Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu has given Ngwelezane Clinic, in the north of the province, a clean bill of health. This was after she paid the 24/7 clinic an unannounced visit on Sunday. The MEC praised management and staff, saying it was pleasing to find the clinic’s premises and wards spotlessly clean. She was also impressed by the positive comments by patients waiting in queues. “We had not received any complaints about this clinic, but we decided to come and see how people work when no one is watching,” Simelane-Zulu said. “Although you can see the structure is old, the service is of a proper and acceptable level,” she said. Simelane-Zulu said the only blot she could find was a faulty ablution facility. “We will fix this on Monday. All in all, we are pleased that the facility is running well. We’ve also been made aware that access in and out of the clinic is sometimes difficult because it’s in the middle of the CBD, which is something we need to raise with the municipality,” the MEC said. Councillor Madl’izinyoka Ntanzi welcomed the unannounced visit.
