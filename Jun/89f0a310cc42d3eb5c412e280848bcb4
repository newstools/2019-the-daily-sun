SINCE Monday, patients have been turned away from Motherwell Healthcare Centre due to a nurses’ strike. Nurses at the clinic in Port Elizabeth said they refused to go to work because they didn’t feel safe. This came after a patient attacked a nurse and two security guards on Saturday. A nurse told Daily Sun: “We took a resolution as staff that we are sick and tired of poor security. We cannot risk our lives and become a target for rude patients. “We demand that the health department beefs up security because we cannot go back to work.” Gogo Fundiswa Ngidana (62) said she was very disappointed to be turned away from the clinic because she needed medical help. “During the election, political parties promised to improve health services but now that we have voted them into power, they don’t bother to provide us with care.” Sibusiso Mdewu (25) said: “It is bad that the community attacks workers. Now we are suffering because of one selfish and badly behaved individual. “This clinic is our only hope in because it is open for 24 hours.” Eastern Cape Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the suspect had been arrested. “We regret the incident but there was no security breach. We appeal to nurses to serve the people. “We will do everything to ensure the safety of all people visiting our health facilities, including staff,” he said.
