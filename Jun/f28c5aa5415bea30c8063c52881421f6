ZANELE Mbele (23) said she suffered a double blow. First it was the horror of her home burning down and then it was stripped by nyaope addicts. She told Daily Sun she was asleep in her bedroom in Zola, Soweto, when she heard a window break. The incident happened in January last year. “I was with my son. We jumped out of bed and found that the house was on fire,” she said. “There was nothing I could do. The house was full of smoke, so we ran outside.” She said by the time the firefighters arrived, the whole house was on fire and nothing could be saved. “I was pregnant with my second child. I had just lost both my parents and now I had no roof over my head. A neighbour took me in and I asked on Facebook for donations of zinc so I could build a shack and people helped.” She said that while she was staying across the road nyaope addicts invaded her home and stripped everything they could get their hands on. “They took the kitchen sink, taps and even the water pipe. They took all the electrical wires and ripped out the burglar bars from the window frames,” said Zanele. Zanele is back in her house but she lives in fear of being attacked again. She said she never opened a case because she didn’t know the nyaope boys.
