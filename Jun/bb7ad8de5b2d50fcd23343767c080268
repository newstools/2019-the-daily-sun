THEIR sister was so badly beaten they thought she was dead. But when they called out her name she responded. Mbali Sibisi (29) from Inanda, north of Durban, was apparently assaulted by friends and locked up in a shack after they accused her of stealing a cellphone. Mbali’s sister Buhle (27) claimed she was moered on Saturday after they had gone out boozing. She said one of Mbali’s friends on Saturday morning asked her to return her cellphone. “Mbali said she didn’t have it and had no idea where it was. Tha’s when the three friends, including two men, started beating her up,” she said. She claimed when she kept telling them she didn’t take the cellphone, they beat her even more. “They even splashed boiling water on her legs and back. They beat her until she collapsed and locked her up in the shack. She was found by the shack owner on Sunday afternoon.” Buhle said when she and others went to the shack and saw her in that state, they thought she was dead. “There was blood everywhere. They had taken her clothes off and dressed her in pyjamas.” They took her to hospital. “She can’t see and she’s peeing blood. Police told us Mbali should open the case herself.” She claimed one of the friends came to apologise after finding the cellphone. “But we want her arrested, along with the two men who beat up my sister. They almost killed her over a cellphone she didn’t have.” Captain Nqobile Gwala said cops visited the victim in hospital and opened an attempted murder case.
