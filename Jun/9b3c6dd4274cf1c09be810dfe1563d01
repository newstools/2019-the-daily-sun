THE People’s Paper lived up to its name once again when it helped kasi residents get an illegal dump cleared. For months, the people of the Govan Mbeki and Missionvale areas of Nelson Mandela Bay complained that rubbish and dead dogs were being dumped near Old Uitenhage Road. Daily Sun published their story last month and according to residents, it helped them. Deon Miggels (57) from Missionvale said: “We were living in a dump. Our dignity was lost as trucks and bakkies from the suburbs were dumping rubbish in our kasi. This place used to be clean and our kids walked freely. “But after the dumping started, we had to accompany kids to school because we feared they would be robbed. “Now it’s over because Daily Sun forced these useless officials to clear away the rubbish.” A cattle owner from Govan Mbeki said two of his cows died last year after eating plastic at the dump. “We reported the problem to our councillors several times, but had no luck.” Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said they had launched a cleaning programme. “It will assist in the area and we will also strengthen awareness and policing. It’s appreciated that the People’s Paper is living up to its name by making us account and deliver better services.”
