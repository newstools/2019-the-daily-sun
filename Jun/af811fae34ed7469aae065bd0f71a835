SHOPPERS and street traders ran for cover as bullets flew at the busy Isipingo Taxi Rank on Monday. This came after three men arrived in a car and shot two men seated in another car. Mzwandile Meyiwa (21) from Folweni, south of Durban, died instantly. Khulekani Njapha (29) was rushed to hospital and is in a critical condition. The car they were sitting in was riddled with bullet holes and blood was splashed all over the seats. It was still not clear why the two were shot. A street trader said the two were in the car they work with at the taxi rank. “They used to help shoppers with groceries and furniture bought at Isipingo shopping centre. “They were hard-working and friendly people. They were not bad people.” The trader said he suspected Meyiwa and Njapha were shot by jealous competitors. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a shooting took place on Inwabi Road, Isipingo. “It is alleged that two men were shot by three suspects,” he told Daily Sun. “One was confirmed dead at the scene while the other was taken to hospital for medical attention. “It is unknown what caused the shooting.”
