ZINHLE Maditla’s lawyer, Jabulani Maphethe, said on Wednesday a psychiatric assessment showed she was extremely angry when she killed her four kids. The 24-year-old appeared in the Witbank Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga, charged with poisoning her kids with rat poison in December. She was taken into custody after turning herself in and confessing. During her previous appearance, the court heard she had an argument with the father of two of the kids after finding him with another woman. She allegedly bought rat poison and put it in the kids’ food. Maditla told the court she had tried to kill herself with the poison. After several appearances, she was sent for psychiatric evaluation at Sterkfontein Hospital and declared fit to stand trial. Maphethe questioned the way Maditla’s confession was obtained, saying her rights were possibly violated as she had no legal representation. He said she won’t interfere with witnesses. The investigating officer said this was unlikely as some of them were family. The case was postponed to next Friday to verify her addresses.
