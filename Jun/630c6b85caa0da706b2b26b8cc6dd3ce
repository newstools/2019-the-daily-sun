THE ANC Harry Gwala region in KZN has accused Ubuhlebezwe mayor Zamo Nxumalo of campaigning for the district mayor’s position. Nxumalo was elected chairman during a regional conference that is still being challenged in court. On Friday, a special regional council meeting was held in Ixopo. Sources in the region said the meeting was attended by the same delegates who elected Nxumalo as chairman in August last year, but other branches were prevented from participating. Another source said the meeting was to influence branches to campaign for Nxumalo although the matter is still in court. “Nxumalo is not the chairman of the region until the court makes a decision, so we don’t understand how he can be elected to the district mayoral position on the basis that he is chairman,” said the source. Leader of the branches Themba Mahlaba, who is challenging the conference in court, said he heard about the meeting, but didn’t receive an invitation. He said he heard Nxumalo’s side submitted three names for the mayor’s position. Nxumalo said his side won the case in the Pietermaritzburg High Court and doesn’t know of an appeal by Mahlaba’s camp. He denied campaigning to be mayor and said his committee hadn’t submitted three names as the Provincial Executive Committee is dealing with the matter of mayors elected to legislature and parliament.
