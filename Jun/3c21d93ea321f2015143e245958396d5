eTHEKWINI Mayor Zandile Gumede is coming under increasing pressure! Thousands of IFP supporters are today expected to bring the Durban city centre to a standstill. They are marching to support calls for the embattled ANC mayor to resign in the wake of corruption charges levelled against her. Gumede, who is also eThekwini ANC regional leader, and ANC Councillor Mondli Mthembu were arrested two weeks ago. They appeared in the Durban Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on charges of fraud and corruption related to a R208 million solid waste tender. The two were released on R50 000 bail each and are expected to appear in court again on 8 August. Today’s march, expected to be led by IFP Youth Brigade national leader Mkhululeko Hlengwa, will start at King Dinuzulu Park. The youth brigade’s eThekwini leader, Mxolisi Nxumalo, said the IFP decided to embark on the march after it became clear Gumede was “ignoring calls for her to step down voluntarily”. Nxumalo said the mayor was undermining residents by refusing to leave her position until her case was finalised. “As residents of eThekwini, we can’t allow a mayor who has been charged with stealing taxpayers’ money to continue leading our municipality. We demand she step down immediately,” said Nxumalo. He said the party believed Gumede violated her bail conditions by delivering her budget speech on Wednesday. He said he had expected the budget would be delivered by deputy mayor Fawzia Peer. The budget speech was slightly delayed after IFP Councillor Mdu Nkosi proposed that the deputy mayor deliver the speech. But his motion was defeated. Gumede said she was not bothered by mounting calls for her to step down and would continue with her duties unabated.
