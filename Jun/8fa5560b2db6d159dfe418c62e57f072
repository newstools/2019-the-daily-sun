FIXING broken couches is what Phehello Mokomela does best. The 35-year-old from Freedom Square works near Highway Supermarket in Bloemfontein. “I started fixing old sofas three years ago. Today my company is called Excellent Upholstery,” he told Daily Sun. Phehello said he dropped out of school when he was in grade 11 because of financial problems. He got a job at Karen van Lingen Upholstery where he learnt the skill. He was also taught by his dad Lebogang Seatlholo. “I also fix car seats and build new sofas from scratch. I use an industrial sewing-machine and wood,” he said. He charges about R4 000 to repair a sofa, depending on the cost of material and transport charges. A new sofa costs about R9 000. “People used to throw away their damaged furniture and buy new stuff. But they don’t have to do that any more. “If they have damaged sofas, they should bring them to me to fix for a reasonable price.” Phehello said he needs a compressor and a generator to make his business extra efficient and he hopes there is a Good Samaritan out there who will help him.
