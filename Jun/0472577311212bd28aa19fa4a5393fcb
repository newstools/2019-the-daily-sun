EUROPE has many languages. Twenty-three are officially recognised, while there are another 60 regional and minority languages too. A new smart earpiece is now making it easier for people of different nations to understand each other by translating words in real time. The Pilot can already be pre-ordered and will be launched this year. It is pre-loaded with English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, but developers have added more languages that will be available in spring. These include Arabic, Mandarin, Chinese, German and Russian. The Pilot consists of two wireless earpieces â€“ one for each speaker. As the person speaks, an app immediately translates the speech and sends the translation to the other earpiece and vice versa.
