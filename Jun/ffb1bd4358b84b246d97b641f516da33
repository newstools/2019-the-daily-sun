 A full council meeting in eThekwini Metro on Thursday left
councillors shocked after allegations of an apparent poisoning attempt on the
mayor emerged. Two councillors tweeted that Speaker William Lekgoa Mapena
had announced that there was paraffin in one of the water bottles handed out
during the meeting. Following the announcement, Acting Mayor Fawzia Peer
apparently "abruptly" left covering her mouth. DA councillor Nicole Graham questioned if someone had
attempted to poison the acting mayor.  The municipality released a statement on Thursday denying
allegations that Peer had been "poisoned". "At this stage, we can confirm that Peer complained
about the taste of the water she had consumed. For precautionary measures she
went to the doctor for a check-up.  "The water she consumed has been sent to the laboratory
for testing. We will wait for the results from the laboratory as well as her
doctor's findings before making any conclusion on the matter." Earlier in the day, council was delayed after ANC
councillors allegedly wanted the city manager, Sipho Nzuza, to exit the
meeting. An altercation ensued with Nzuza's security detail having to
step in to protect him. Speaking to News24, Nzuza said the incident was not directed
at him. "That involved the speaker of the council."  Mapena said the incident was just "robust debate"
between ANC councillors. The municipality has been chaotic since the announcement
that Zandile Gumede would step down as mayor. The ANC put her on special leave while she faces accusations
of corruption related to a R230m Durban Solid Waste tender. The Hawks have alleged that she used her political influence
to award contracts, often flouting supply chain management processes. Her bail conditions prevent her from dealing with key units
within the metro. SOURCE: NEWS24
