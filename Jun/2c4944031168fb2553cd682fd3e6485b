WHEN Mandilakhe Ndibongo (34) got to the scene, there were four bodies lying on the road. Mandilakhe found out later that one of the bodies was that of the driver of the car that had allegedly knocked down three people. Angry residents of Khayelitsha in Cape Town allegedly killed the driver on Sunday. “Everything happened so fast. I heard a bang and, as I ran out of my house, I heard people crying.” Another resident claimed the driver was speeding. “If he was not speeding, these people would still be alive,” he said. Resident Zukile Mancoko said one of the dead men was a scrap metal collector. He said the crash could’ve been avoided. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said cases of murder and culpable homicide have been opened for investigation by Harare police. “According to information, a Toyota Camry drove into a shack and the driver fled the scene. “People came to see what was happening and a VW Golf knocked down and killed two unidentified women and a man. “The driver was stabbed and died of his injuries. Nobody has been arrested.”
