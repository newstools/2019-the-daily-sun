BANYANA Banyana forward Thembi Kgatlana has accepted her likening to Nigeria’s Asisat Oshoala, who plays for Barcelona Ladies. But Kgatlana says she will not allow the comparison to one of the greatest footballers to go deeper into her head. Kgatlana’s meteoric rise has been sensational for Banyana, helping them qualify for their maiden Fifa Women’s World Cup, which will kick off in France tonight. The 23-year-old Randfontein-born will lead Banyana’s attack when they face Spain in their opening match at the Stade Océane, Le Havreon Saturday (6pm). Earlier this year, Kgatlana became the second SA player to win the prestigious Caf Women Player of the Year – after legendary Noko Matlou won it in 2008. Kgatlana, who plays for Beijing BG Phoenix in China, pipped Nigerian duo of Oshoala and Fransisca Ordega to scoop the award. “There is no pressure for me. And the award has not gone deeper into my head. “She (Oshoala) has won it a couple of times. I have won it once and people will want me to be consistent and that is all. I still have a lot of things that I want to achieve. She is great, one of my favourite players in the world,” Kgatlana said. She said she will not pressurise herself in France, but will apply herself normally with the aim of contributing to the team against Spain, China and Germany. “Right now, we need to win against Spain,” she said.
