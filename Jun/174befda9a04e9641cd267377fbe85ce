SUPPORTERS of eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede have demanded that ANC’s national leaders intervene in the provincial decision to force her to take leave. Yesterday, more than 100 supporters went to the ANC’s provincial headquarters in Durban to demand a response to a memorandum they gave to secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli last week. They also demanded national chairman Gwede Mantashe and secretary-general Ace Magashule intervene in the matter. They arrived at 12pm but after 2pm, they were still waiting for Ntuli. Protest leader Mzo Dube said Ntuli asked to meet them but then couldn’t do so as he was in a meeting. Dube said they planned to approach Mantashe and Magashule last week to resolve the matter. He said yesterday was the last chance provincial leaders would get to resolve the matter. He said they were demanding that Gumede be allowed to return to work. “All we are saying is the PEC was wrong to make a decision about her before she was found guilty.” Dube said they were not angry with last week’s statement by provincial party spokeswoman Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu, saying they couldn’t go back on the decision. Simelane-Zulu also said councillors taking part in marches would be dealt with, which Dube said they regarded as intimidation. Gumede and Councillor Mondli Mthembu were released on R50 000 bail after being charged with fraud and money laundering last month in connection with a R208 million solid waste tender.
