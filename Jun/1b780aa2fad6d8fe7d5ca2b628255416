By AARON DUBE  Another charge has been added on sheet in Gugu Ncube’s case! A charge of Demostration without permission has been added
on Gugu’s case. This follows after she was charged with Public Indecency . This follows after Gugu Ncube staged a nude protested at the
Union Buildings in Pretoria in March this year. She was arrested and later released free bail. In her third court appearance, Gugu, appeared today at Pretoria Magistrate Court in Tshwane. A sad looking Gugu said she wanted the case to get done as
soon as possible. She was accompanied by her lawyer, Mpho Nefori, and mum,
Progress Dube. Gugu staged a nude protest at Union Buildings due to alleged
sexual abuse she experienced at UNISA. Gugu said she was fired from her job at UNISA after she
refused to have sex with her manager. Gugu's mum Progress Dube (42) said the family was not happy
every time she attended the court. "I believe she is unfairly treated and the court has
delayed us as they keep on postponing the case," she said. Gugu's lawyer, Mpho Nefori, said she was not happy. "I prepared for trial and wanted to finalise this
matter. Nefori said the state brought in new charges. "I'm not happy, Gugu is not happy, no one is
happy," said her lawyer. Nefori said they were ambushed by new charges and couldn't
proceed since they prepared themselves on public Indecency. Gugu was arrested for Public Indecency and demonstration
without permission. The case has been postponed to 22 July this year.
