THE family of a woman who was stabbed to death last Wednesday are asking residents to help find her ex-boyfriend. Mbali Cele (24) from Amatikwe in Inanda, north of Durban was allegedly stabbed to death in her home by the man she dumped a few months ago. Her cousin Sthe Nyanda said: “This guy is hiding at someone’s house. Please do the right thing, whoever you are.” Sthe said the suspect allegedly entered the house and shoved their 70-year-old gogo on the floor, leaving her unconscious. She said he then stabbed their aunt before stabbing Mbali in her bedroom. “I wish it was a dream but she’s really gone,” she said. She said the ex-boyfriend abused her cousin, even after she got a protection order against him. Sthe said the death penalty should be brought back for these incidents, “She sent me a message the previous Friday, saying she feared her life was in danger and a few days later she was dead.” Sthe said the suspect drives taxis from Bester to KwaMashu, north of Durban. KZN police spokeswoma, Captain Nqobile Gwala said Inanda police are investigating a case of murder. “A 24-year-old woman was allegedly stabbed to death with a sharp object by a known suspect while at Amatikwe. “The suspect is still being hunted by police,” Gwala said.
