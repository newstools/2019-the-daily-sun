Proteas fast bowler Dale Steyn has been ruled out the ICC Cricket World Cup through injury. The speedster has been battling to recover from a shoulder injury that he picked up while on IPL duty with the Royal Challengers Bangalore last month. This is the second shoulder injury Steyn has suffered and it has not responded to treatment, ruling him out of bowling for the foreseeable future. His place in the squad will be taken by left-arm fast bowler Beuran Hendricks who plays for the Highveld Lions. The ICC confirmed on Tuesday that the Event Technical Committee of the ICC Menâ€™s Cricket World Cup 2019, approved Hendricks to replace the Phalaborwa Express for the remainder of the tournament. Hendricks could be thrown right into the thick of things when he arrives on Monday morning with the Proteas plagued by injuries after Lungi Ngidi tweaked his groin in the defeat to Bangladesh on Sunday. The Proteas face one of the tournament favourites India at the Rose Bowl in Southampton on Wednesday (11am SA Time) in a must-win-match as they look to get their campaign back on track.
