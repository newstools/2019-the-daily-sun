RESIDENTS of Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, are worried. They complained about 15 street lights that are never switched off. Resident Anathi Mupongoshe (41) said: “It’s not good to leave the street lights turned on day and night. “This is taxpayers’ money that is being wasted. “The municipality should switch the lights on at night.” Anymore Klaas (43), who lives in a shack at Shukushukuma, said: “I don’t have electricity in my shack. “The municipality should provide us with power instead of wasting it on street lights. The street lights are very powerful, and they use lots of electricity.” George Geleba, a spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani, said the lights will be fixed as a matter of urgency. He told Daily Sun: “We have alerted our technicians and they are going to fix the lights soon. “It’s a technical error which they will come and correct. “The municipality would like to appeal to residents to report such incidents.”
