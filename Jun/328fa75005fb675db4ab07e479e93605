THUGS are targeting vulnerable women in Tshwane. Two men aged 23 and 36, believed to be responsible for attacks on women pedestrians in Sunnyside, were arrested last Tuesday. Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the suspects have been linked to three separate street robbery attacks on women last month. “Handbags and cellphones worth about R32 000 were snatched from the victims,” he said. Mavimbela said the suspects appeared in the Pretoria Magistrates Court after their arrest. “Police made a successful request for the suspects to be kept in jail while other victims are being traced,” he said. Mavimbela said Sunnyside police management has appointed a young team of energetic detectives to look at other cases. “They will be reviewing cases that arose from criminal activities, including smash and grabs reported from or near Nelson Mandela Drive.” Mavimbela said the two suspects are due back in court today on charges of robbery.
