Music is a universal language, making you feel the message being delivered. One talented musician who shares his message without lyrics is saxophonist Bongani Radebe. His debut album, the saxophone rendition of Nathi Mankayi’s Buyelekhaya album, took Mzansi by storm in 2016. Bongane is releasing his second album, Sax Rendition Volume 2, on Friday. He said people should expect the best from it. He told SunBuzz the song Emakhaya stands out. “There was a time in primary school when I didn’t have shoes and my teacher and classmates bought and donated shoes. “It happened again in high school. I didn’t have shoes and someone bought me shoes again. This was because I lost my parents when I was nine and no one took care of me. “Emakhaya reminds me of situations I faced. I’m sure people will relate and love it.” The musician, who grew up in KwaThema in Ekurhuleni, said his tough upbringing always made him look on the bright side. “When I was young, I saw myself becoming a star and an influence on the world. I understood patience is a virtue and what I was going through was just temporary. “So I pushed hard and always thought about the future. Fast forward to today, where I am ready to release my second album.” Bongane said it features songs by Vusi Nova and trio 047 and people will enjoy it. “It will motivate people. It’s music you listen to when you’re tired or studying. Some songs will calm you down and some make you dance.”
