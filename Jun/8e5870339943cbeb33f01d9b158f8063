THE ANC finally got around to laying charges of crimen injuria and incitement to violence against Steve Hofmeyr. The party originally planned to lay the charges against the Afrikaans singer in Cape Town on Thursday, but only managed to do so at the Joburg Central Police Station yesterday. This was after Hofmeyr issued death threats against Mzansi’s ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela, and DA MP Phumzile van Damme. Last Tuesday, Hofmeyr caused a stir with a tweet he later deleted, which read: “Dear @zilevandamme and @zindziMandela, I’m a South African tax-paying citizen. Effectively, I am your boss. You will jump when I say so and you will ask how high. “And when you come to take our lives and land, you will die. Our contract is that simple. And don’t you forget it.” ANC spokesman Pule Mabe said no matter how angry Mandela’s tweet had made people, it was not an excuse to make statements inciting violence. When asked about Mandela’s tweets, Mabe said the international relations department was dealing with the issue.
