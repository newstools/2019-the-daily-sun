THE Mpumalanga Community Safety Department has expressed shock at the behaviour of taxi drivers. This after a video showing a 16-seater Quantum transporting 27 passengers this week went viral. The taxi was stopped on the N4 road near Mbombela on Wednesday, and was believed to be travelling towards Mozambique. In the video, traffic officials order all passengers, including seven kids, to get out so they can be counted. When asked why the taxi was so full, the driver said he picked people up on the way as they were stranded. He claimed they were travelling to Mbombela. “I was only trying to help the driver who was stuck and after seeing the children crying of hunger, I decided to do this,” said the driver. Community safety spokesman Moeti Mmusi said: “We are appealing to transport owners to ensure drivers follow the rules of the road as such incidents can lead to death.”
