THE donation of a brand new paediatric burns unit to Ngwelezane Hospital in Empangeni, northern KZN, came at the right time. This was according to the KZN Department of Health’s chief director of clinical support services, Dr Sandile Tshabalala. He was speaking at its official launch on Tuesday. “It’s critical to open this unit at this time of the year because when winter comes, people who live in rural areas tend to experience more burns. “Choosing to have a burns unit at this institution is one of the best decisions ever made.” He said the unit would cater for burn victims between the ages of one and 12 years old. It will not only be open for children from Empangeni but also those in the surrounding King Cetshwayo, Zululand and UMkhanyakude districts. The unit was completed in April and consists of 22 beds. Tshabalala thanked M-Net’s Carte Blanche Making a Difference Trust and other partners, such as the mining and metals company South 32, for making the project happen. “Our MEC sees you as partners. The view she holds is one that says health is not a health department issue, nor is it a government issue. The health of a society is a societal matter.”
