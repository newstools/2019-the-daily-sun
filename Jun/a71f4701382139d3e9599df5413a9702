FIVE months ago people from outside their area were allegedly hired as cleaners at the local clinic. Last Thursday residents shut down the facility in protest against being overlooked for vacancies. But now Imbalenhle Clinic in Imbali, Pietermaritzburg, is back in operation. Resident Thembani Khuzwayo (36) said they had been asked to bring their CVs to be considered for employment. “Fifteen of those interviewed were told they had jobs and were promised they would start work before Easter. But they were never called,” said Thembani. Ntokozo Mkhize (30) said they were tired of being sidelined. “We’re not saying all the cleaners must come from the area. We’re asking that they consider us, too,” he said. Ward councillor Xolani Ngongoma said he was aware of the matter. “I did have meetings with clinic management on behalf of residents. They ended up promising to hire 15 residents from the ward. But these residents have been waiting ever since. I sent the clinic emails but they never responded,” said Ngongoma. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cases of public violence were opened and eight protesters were arrested. KZN health spokeswoman Ncumisa Mafunda said the employment of cleaners was an issue that concerned the independent employment agency.
