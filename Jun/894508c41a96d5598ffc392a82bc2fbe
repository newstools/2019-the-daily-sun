Thabazimbi cops have arrested a pastor (51) for allegedly raping a 12-year-old
girl. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said it is alleged that the suspect
arrived at the victim's house for a prayer session and then told the victim's
mother that the girl was sick. He further claimed the girl should go with him to the nearest river so that she
can receive her healing. Ngoepe said the mother later started panicking when the two were not returning
and she informed the father who then followed them. “He was surprised to see his child half-naked, running and screaming for help,”
Ngoepe said. The
frightened girl then alleged that the pastor raped her. The police were immediately notified, the rape case was opened and the suspect
was followed until he was arrested. Ngoepe said the suspect will soon appear before the Thabazimbi magistrate
court. The Acting Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in
Limpopo Major General Jan Scheepers has condemned the continuous acts of sexual
violence perpetrated against children.
