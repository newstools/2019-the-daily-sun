 Calvin is a well-known Durban businessman and owner of Calvin and Family Group. Sma resigned from Ukhozi FM to run some of his businesses. Calvin was in the news in 2017 when he claimed on social media that some politicians in Durban were trying to drag his name through the mud by claiming he was corrupt. He said these politicians were responsible for killing councillors in Durban and he dared them to come after him, threatening to expose them. It is not clear whether his attack is linked to these claims. A source said security has been tightened at the Mathibela household. He said he was sitting with Sma on Saturday evening when he heard a gunshot outside. “I took my gun and told Sma to call the police and the security firm. Then I went outside because I wanted to protect my family. “When I was taking cover outside the house I saw a security guard lying on the ground. He was shot. He told me there was a man demanding to see me.” Calvin said at first he only saw one gunman. The man shot at him and he returned fire. “I realised there were other men and we exchanged gunfire. I was shot in the leg and then the men ran down the street, got into a car and drove off,” he said. Calvin said his security guard was still in hospital and had sustained minor injuries. Calvin believes the alleged hit was planned, as the neighbours told him they were trying to call the cops but there was no network. He said even Sma couldn’t call the cops because the network only came back after a few minutes. “I know who had been plotting to kill me but I am not going to discuss that with the media. I am not scared, I do not get intimidated that easily. I am a man.” KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of attempted murder was opened at the Durban North Police Station.
