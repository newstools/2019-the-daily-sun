FIVE houses swimming in a sea of kak have been rescued. Residents who have been troubled by kak at Mbilini Road at KwaZakhele kasi in Port Elizabeth for months were set free on Saturday morning when the truck from the municipality arrived to suck out the pipes and repair blocked drains. This happened after Daily Sun published the story on Thursday. Relieved and grateful resident Ayanda Nkosi (43) said: “I am happy we are free at last. There will be no more stink in our area. We have been trying to get attention from the municipality for months and we have been phoning in vain. We are grateful to the People’s Paper.” He said after the story appeared on Thursday the truck arrived on Friday. “They inspected the damage and promised to come back the following day. On Saturday at 9am they were here.” Ayanda said the workers warned that the drains would leak again. “They said their work wasn’t perfect as residents have built flats and shacks over our drains.” Nelson Mandela spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “We always listen to the cries of the residents and respond quickly. And we will investigate the issue of flats and shacks built over the sewerage system.”
