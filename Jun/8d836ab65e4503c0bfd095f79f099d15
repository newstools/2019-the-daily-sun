WHEN Siyanda Ngwenya noticed smoke coming out of the back of his BMW 320i, he kept driving until he got to a garage. But the smoke got worse, and just after he stopped at a taxi rank and he and his passenger got out, the car exploded in flames! The 44-year-old from North Beach in Durban was driving on Malandela Road in KwaMashu on Sunday evening when the incident happened. He told Daily Sun: “I panicked as the flames covered the whole car. “I asked taxi drivers for help and some came with water and fire extinguishers, but the fire only grew stronger.” Siyanda said he just stood back and watched helplessly as his BMW burned. “I don’t know what caused the fire, but smoke came from the back of the car. “This really shocked me as I didn’t think it could ever happen. I was taking someone to Ntuzuma when it happened.” A witness said Siyanda and the woman he was travelling with almost died. “Cops came and contacted firefighters. The firefighters arrived while the car was still burning and tried to put out the fire, but it was too late.” Siyanda said he bought the car in 2012 and it didn’t have any problems. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said KwaMashu cops attended to the scene. No case was opened.
