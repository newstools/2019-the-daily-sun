THE Ntabankulu Municipality in Ndakeni Village, Eastern Cape, demolished homes on Wednesday. Some 81 houses were destroyed. The municipality said the structures were illegally built. The land in question was allegedly claimed by Amanci Traditional Council and could not be used. Municipal manager Luleka Nonyongo said they had been asking the community to stop building in the area. “The municipality executed a court order that ordered the eviction of community members who illegally occupied land alongside Ndakeni Village. The community ignored countless attempts for engagement, which forced the municipality to demolish houses built over the past few weeks.”
