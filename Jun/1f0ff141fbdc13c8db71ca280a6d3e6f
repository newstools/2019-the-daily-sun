THE failure of a Transnet temping machine’s brakes caused it to run down the track and crash into a commuter train on Saturday, injuring 64 people. This is contained in a report compiled by the Railway Safety Regulator and released by Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula on Wednesday. The report also said there was poor communication between the temping machine crew and the train control centre before the accident. The crash took place at Eerste Fabriek Station in Mamelodi, Tshwane. Two crew members suffered minor to moderate injuries. Mbalula said: “The report also noted the signalling system between the Eerste Fabriek and Pienaarspoort stations hasn’t been functional for almost two years.” It also found the train crew had performed their duties professionally and calmly, avoiding more injuries. “I’m concerned at the findings that commuters interfered with the safety operation of the train by activating the passenger emergency alarm when the driver tried to move the train backwards to avoid a collision,” he said. Mbalula said his department would make sure action was taken to prevent an accident like Saturday’s occurring again.
