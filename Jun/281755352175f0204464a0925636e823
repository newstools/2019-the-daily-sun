ACCORDING to defence lawyer Mike Hellens, Duduzane Zuma did nothing wrong on the night of 9 February 2014 when Phumzile Dube died. Hellens was presenting his case in the Randburg Magistrates Court yesterday. He said there was nothing Duduzane could have done to avoid the accident when his car skidded in water, which is known as aquaplaning. State prosecutor Yusuf Baba maintained that had Duduzane been driving more slowly, the skidding could have been avoided. He said as it was raining heavily that night, Duduzane should have reduced his speed. He said the tyres of Duduzane’s Porsche were also in a poor condition. He said Duduzane was advised to buy new tyres when his car went for a service but he declined to do so. The defence said the JMPD’s Johann van Loggerenberg, who attended the accident, told the court Duduzane’s car was in a good condition and that its tyre treads met the legal requirements. Jacques Cronje, Porsche Centre Joburg’s dealer principal, said the Porsche 911 Turbo had problems with aquaplaning even at lower speeds. He said the ordinary driver would not be able to foresee the problem. The case has been postponed to 12 July for judgment.
