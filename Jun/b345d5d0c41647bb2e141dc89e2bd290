The government must prioritise security arrangements at state hospitals. It is obvious people are taking advantage of the easy access to our hospitals. After the attempted rape of a doctor at Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein recently, Iâ€™m not surprised doctors fear for their safety. It was horrifying that such an evil deed could take place at a state hospital. Doctors must feel safe in their working environments so they can perform their duties without fear. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize must take steps to tighten security at government hospitals to ensure the safety of doctors, nurses, support staff, patients and visitors.
