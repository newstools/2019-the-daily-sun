 TO celebrate
the birthday of his cousin and bestie, Cassper Nyovest reportedly spent over
R220 000 on 100 bottles of vodka. On Sunday Carpo
More and Cassper Nyovest had the time of their lives at SUMO in Rosebank. However,
many took to social media to question as to why Nyovest was paying to the Ciroc
bottles if he is the ambassador of the brand of vodka. The social
media post by Cassper had the word ‘ÄD’ which might suggest that it was paid
for by a brand.
