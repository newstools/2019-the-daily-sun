A MAN is shattered after his family were gunned down. Themba Maphumulo (35) believes the bullets were meant for him. Themba from Maqongqo, outside Pietermaritzburg in the KZN Midlands, said three men came looking for him on Sunday. They didn’t find him and allegedly shot five members of his family. His sister Kwenzi (29) and her child Melokuhle (2) died, while his fiancee Nomfundo Goge (33), his other pregnant sister Velile (19) and dad Alfred (71) were badly hurt. He said the men wanted to kill him following an argument. “Before the shooting I discovered that our water pump was broken and phoned my neighbour to come fix it. He asked me to fetch him because he was injured,” he said. Themba said the neighbour had told him he was moered by men from the area. “I told him to call the cops. The men who beat him then called and asked him to come to them so they could sort out the matter.” Themba said he and the neighbour went to see the men, and that’s when all hell broke loose. “The men started attacking us. One of them shot at me but missed and shot my neighbour.” Themba and his neighbour fled and went to the police station, but cops told him to rush the neighbour to hospital. Captain Nqobile Gwala said two cases of murder and three of attempted murder were opened.
