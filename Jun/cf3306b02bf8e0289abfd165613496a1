FOR someone who was once accused of being “heavy and sluggish”, Kamohelo Mokotjo has come a long way to earn his position in Bafana Bafana. Probably never in his wildest dreams did the Brentford midfielder imagined that someday he’d be going to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), after his fallout with ex-coach Ephraim “Shakes” Mashaba four years ago. But here he is now, ready to go to combat in Egypt. At 28, the Odendaalsrus-born midfielder is supposedly one of the senior players in Stuart Baxter’s team. But with 13 caps, he certainly doesn’t look like one of the cavalrymen. He was exceptional in the 2-1 qualifier win against Libya, justified Baxter’s faith in him. And he could get more game time in the finals. “I’ve been waiting for my opportunity, and not just been waiting and hoping that, by luck, I get a chance. But I’ve been working hard to be where I am right now,” says Mokotjo after Bafana’s training session. “But every camp is different, every game is different. My goal now is to get myself in the team. If I do, my dream will be to get the country as far as possible in the tournament. I honestly believe that we can. “Once all the preparation comes together in a week or so everyone will be speaking confidently going into the first match. “Most of us are going to the Afcon for the first time and might be our last time.” Mokotjo has now spent a decade overseas, playing in the Dutch Eredivisie and now in the English Championship. He has since buried the hatchet with Mashaba and looks happy to be working with Baxter, who rates him highly. He will certainly be looking to make up for lost time, and who knows, perhaps get himself a piece of silverware. “We fancy our chances. If we are undermined that would be to our advantage because we know how well we can play,” he says. “We are not going in the tournament as underdogs, but if we are looked at as underdogs then that would be an advantage to us.”
