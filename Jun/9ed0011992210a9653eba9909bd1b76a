FORMER Banyana Banyana player Amanda “Tokkie” Dlamini says the fact that the team will be playing in their first ever Fifa Women’s World Cup should not be used as an excuse for failure. Dlamini, who retired from the national team in January last year to pursue a full-time career on TV, believes Banyana have all the qualities to make an impression in France, where they will be making their first appearance. The eight edition of the women’s tournament started on Friday until 7 July. Banyana will get their tournament underway with a testing encounter against Spain on Saturday evening (6pm) at Oceane Stadium in Le Havre. Banyana are in Group B with Germany, Spain and China. It will be a baptism of fire for Desiree Ellis and her charges, considering their opening match where they lost 7-2 loss to Norway on Sunday, and have not won in 10 preparation friendlies. The last time they won a match was against Mali (2-0) during last year’s Africa Women’s Cup of Nations. Their back pack is also a nightmare, where they conceded in most of the matches played this year, and Ellis has admitted they will deal with the problem. The last time Banyana beat non-African opposition was in a 1-0 win over Hungary in March last year during the Cyrus Cup. But they will be hoping to change all that – it is possible, according to Dlamini. “It would be unfair to gauge their World Cup performance based on the recent friendlies,” argued Dlamini. “We cannot expect a 7-2 score-line in the World Cup. The mentality would be completely different in their first match. We are the lowest ranked team, so the teams might dominate us, but we will also need to prove our worth.” Banyana have been in two Olympic Games in 2012 and 2016, and such an experience could come in handy in France. Dlamini added: “We are capable of making it to the next round of the tournament.”
