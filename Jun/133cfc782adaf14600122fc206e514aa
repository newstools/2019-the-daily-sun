FROM winning the Belgium Player of the Season award to graduating from school. Percy Tau has undoubtedly had an incredible season. But it doesn’t end there for the Bafana Bafana star. Next is the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals. The Saint Gilloise enterprising midfielder is currently in camp with the national team preparing for the upcoming Afcon tourney, kicking off in Egypt on 21 June. “The Afcon is huge for everybody. Lucky enough for me, it comes at age 25. For Lebo (Mothiba) it comes at 23,” said Tau. “It will be my first time, as it will be for some of the guys, too. But it’ll be good to go out there, compete and win it for the nation. I’m looking forward to it.” Tau literally transported South Africa to the Afcon with an astonishing brace in Bafana’s crucial 2-1 victory over Libya in their last Afcon qualifier in March. But that hasn’t been the only highlight for him this season. “There are a lot of positives to take out of my journey this season. I was able to finish school. I’m very proud of that. And also to continue the hard work and be named the player of the season,” Tau said. “It has brought a lot of confidence.” The former Mamelodi Sundowns was as bubbly as ever, spraying champagne passes during Bafana’s second training session in Joburg yesterday. The three-week break has clearly done him a world of good after a long season in the Belgian first division. “I’ve had time to rest. I feel refreshed,” he said, in between a chuckle. “A three-week break is not bad at all. If you look after yourself quite well, it becomes easier. Sundowns prepared me for such tough schedule. My mind is on Bafana right now. I just want to get ready for the tournament.”
