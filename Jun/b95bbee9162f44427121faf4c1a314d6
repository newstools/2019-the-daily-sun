ORDERING food from home is about to get a lot easier for Soweto residents. Thanks to the launch of Uber Eats in the famous kasi. Its aim is to uplift local residents and businesses and create job opportunities. There are hundreds of food businesses in Soweto that will benefit positively from this business opportunity. Ailyssa Pretorius, general manager of Uber Eats in South Africa, explained that Sowetans had been calling for affordable and reliable food delivery services. “We’re thrilled to have answered this growing demand through this service,” said Ailyssa. “Since the launch in South Africa two-and-a-half years ago, we’ve been blown away by the popularity of food delivery services. “We can’t wait to give Soweto residents and other areas access to the hi-tech that will truly transform the way people order and enjoy their food.” She added that while this was a global business, with a presence in more than 600 cities around the globe, its recipe for success was built on catering to the local taste and habits of the cities they operated in. “Hence we’ve doubled our effort to bring the best food Soweto has to offer at a reasonable price.” Orders can be delivered with the use of cars, bicycles and motorbikes for as little as R10 per delivery. In South Africa, Uber Eats is currently operational in nine areas, including Joburg, Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Paarl, Pietermaritzburg, Bloemfontein, Port Elizabeth and Soweto.
