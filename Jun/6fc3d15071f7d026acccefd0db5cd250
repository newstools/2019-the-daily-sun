WHEN Kaizer Chiefs unleashed Serge Djiehoua in the 2005/2006 season, a lot was expected from this big animal from the Ivory Coast. There were a few promising touches and moves when he made his debut for Amakhosi, he was even nicknamed “Jehova”. The supporters instantly loved his muscular physique and thought that he was going to bulldoze his way to scoring many goals, but it was not to be. Built more like a body-builder than a soccer star, he struggled to establish himself as a proven goal-poacher even when he played alongside superstars Thabo “Tsiki-Tsiki” Mooki, Emmanuel “Scara” Ngobese and Arthur “10111” Zwane, all midfield geniuses who created a lot of goals for their strikers. One of his lowlights was when he suffered a career-threatening injury from an Andrew “Jaws of Life” reckless Rabutla tackle. Djiehoua underwent an operation as he had damaged cruciate ligaments in the back of his knee as well as torn muscles in the back of the calf. After failing at Chiefs, Djiehoua was shipped off to Thanda Royal Zulu where he enjoyed a better spell and scored a few goals. He then went to play in the Turkish League. One of his most embarrassing achievements was receiving the fastest red card ever in 3 seconds – he was making his debut for his debut for Glyfada against Olympiacos Volou.
