Dear MizzB I AM a 21-year-old man and still a virgin. I’d like to date just like my peers, but I’m afraid of women. Please help. Dear Worried Telling someone how you feel about them can’t be easy as you don’t know how they’ll react. It’s natural for a man to develop feelings for a woman. Feeling afraid to approach and talk to women shows you understand people have different personalities. Take this as a ball game – you win some, you lose some. You’ll never know how good you are at making conversation until you try. All the best.
