Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is investigating allegations against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba, her office confirmed on Friday. Her spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe, told News24 that witnesses were being interviewed as part of the probe. The complaints, laid by the ANC and SACP in Johannesburg, revolve around the alleged irregular appointments of the head of the City of Johannesburg's anti-corruption unit, General Shadrack Sibiya, and Johannesburg Metro Police Department chief David Tembe. Segalwe said it was claimed that Sibiya had been appointed at a particular level "which was altered to a higher level" without due process being followed. Tembe, it was claimed, had been appointed to a position for which he was not qualified, he added.  Furthermore, Mashaba was also being investigated for a conflict of interest complaint after a company in which his wife was linked to, was appointed as a service provider. Mashaba’s spokesperson Olebogeng Molatlhwa said the issues being investigated were nothing new.  The mayor two months ago said the nucleus of the Public Protector’s investigation surrounded the appointment of "key figures in the City who our multi-party government has come to rely on heavily". The investigation, he contended, targets him personally, "alleging that my vendetta with Setheo Engineering arises from my involvement with a rival company’ which lost out on a tender".  "It is clear to us that we are heading towards a report from the Public Protector that will be taken on review. Our legal team is ready for this," he said at the time.  Molatlhwa said the mayor "would not like to give credence to the ANC's use of state institutions to fight political battles". https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/herman-mashaba-under-investigation-by-public-protector-20190628
