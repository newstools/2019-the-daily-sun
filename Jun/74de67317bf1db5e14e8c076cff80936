commuters are still stranded in Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain after the N2 Express joint venture was suspended last week. Transport MMC Felicity Purchase said commuters who had bought monthly tickets would be refunded. She said she was hopeful that talks between the City of Cape Town and the taxis over the route will be over soon. “We advise commuters to please visit the zone 3 kiosk at the Civic MyCiTi Station in Cape Town where they will be required to complete a refund form. “The refund will be immediate, and in cash, once they have completed and signed the form,” said Purchase. “Unfortunately, we cannot refund commuters at the kiosks in Khayelitsha or Mitchells Plain due to threats to our MyCiTi personnel, and for security reasons.” She apologised to their passengers for the inconvenience. Siyabonga Bikoza (33) from iLitha Park in Khayelitsha said he regretted putting his trust in unreliable trains. “I loaded R850 in my MyCiti card on 26 May, hoping to use it for the month. “They are giving us our money back but June’s going to be a long and tough month without a MyCiti bus,” he said.
