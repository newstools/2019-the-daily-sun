Hello, SunLanders I’m so excited to join Daily Sun and Sunday Sun as the new editor-in-chief. Hello! Dumelang! Sanibonani! Molweni! Avuxeni! Aa! I was born in Winterveldt and grew up in Atteridgeville. Ke ngwanyana wa Pitori, hoop! hoop! to Pheli vibes and ubuntu. I started my newspaper career at our sister paper City Press, and worked for True Love magazine, before rejoining newspapers again: Sowetan and Sunday World. I’m happy to be back home in SunLand. I know how important these papers are to you, and can see by the way you call us or come to our offices every day to tell us your stories. You trust us not only to listen to you with empathy and understanding, but to also fight your battles and win. At Daily Sun we know that the most important person in our business is you. You have the power to build or destroy us. I’d like to invite you to continue to support us, and let us take the paper to greater heights with your backing. Like many editors before me, my promise to you is simple: This paper is answerable to dear Sipho, whose important contribution makes all our communities a better place to live in. You’re free to contact us and praise us, or to voice your concerns to make sure we serve your best interests. – Mapula Nkosi
