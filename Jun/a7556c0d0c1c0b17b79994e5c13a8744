THE dead are supposed to rest in peace, but it doesn’t seem to be the case at this graveyard. Mbaleni in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, is one of Thulamela Municipality’s busiest cemeteries, but it is the most neglected. Even cemeteries in rural villages are well kept. Thick bushes are everywhere and only the section next to the entrance has been cleaned. The graveyard has become a den of thieves. Residents nearby are now living in fear as thugs use it as a hiding place and for storing their loot. Stella Mulaudzi, who lives nearby, said she was scared as criminals had taken over. “We’ve been complaining about the thick bushes here. It’s no longer safe. We hear of break-ins and theft. “It’s not surprising because thugs have found a home at the cemetery. “We appeal to the municipality to clear this area and let the dead rest in peace.” David Mutavhatsindi, who lives next to the graveyard, said: “Our municipality is letting us down and making us vulnerable to criminals. I think it should employ people to take care of this cemetery. It now looks like the dead have been forgotten. “The only clean part of the graveyard is the entrance. “Many people illegally enter the cemetery, which should be closed and the entrance controlled. “The sooner the municipality does something about this the better, or else we remain at the mercy of these thugs,” he said. Thulamela municipal spokesman Ndwamato Tshiila said they’d soon start clearing the cemetery and closing all the openings.
