IMAGINE having a car that tells you when there is a pothole advancing ahead of you? Meet 30-year-old female soldier, Masego Major, from Krugersdorp. She says her turbocharged Golf 7 Tsi makes driving simple and enjoyable. “The comfort I get in my car is the best feeling ever and elevates my ego,” she said. Q: When did you buy your Golf 7? A: I bought it in April 2017. Q: Do you have a pet name for it? A: Beauty and the Beast, enforcing a good feeling of who I am and when its roars. Q: What’s special about the Beast? A: It’s fast and roars as I zoom in or out of town. Q: Is the Beast your first car? A: No, I had a BMW 1 series. Q: Why do you love this one? A: It’s spacious, comfortable, and feels like I am in an exclusive lounge. This car is the best! I tell you, people turn their heads wherever I go. Q: Is this your dream car? A: Yes, definitely. Q: What features make you happy? A: The interior and music system is great. Q: Does anyone else drive her? A: No, unless there is emergency and it’s a person I trust. Q: Any traffic fines? A: No, never. Q: What do think about other road users? A: I think let us fix the roads first, then will see what causes accidents.
