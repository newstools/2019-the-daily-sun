MAKING his mark on the hip hop scene was always part of DJ Vino’s plan. He said while growing up he always loved music and knew whatever he did had to involve it. The DJ said he worked hard to earn the name Vino With The Hits. He said his highlight since he started his career in 2012 was working with big artists such as AKA, DA L.E.S and Stilo Magolide. He said he was inspired to work hard to reach their level. Vino, whose real name is Mlungisi Gumede (25), told SunBuzz he has a new song out called iYeaus. It’s produced by Tru Hits and features Yanga Chief, Gemini Major and JR. The DJ said it was inspired by the hip hop lifestyle and culture. “I am a street DJ and the single started on the street. “I just chose artists who will make it a vibe because they understand the urban culture. This is the kind of song you can listen to when you’re planning to go out and have fun. It just sets the mood,” said Vino. He said the song was about spreading positive vibes. “I’ve been getting so much love. “People say it cheers them up and I’m happy it serves its purpose because I love seeing people having a good time.” The artist and producer from Klipspruit, Soweto, said when he’s not making music, he puts together hip hop mixes. He has an online initiative called Binate Mix where he releases mixes every second Friday and features a hip hop DJ. “I felt like DJs were no longer making mixes so I took it upon myself to do the extra work. Binate Mix has themes and I invite a different DJ to join me each session. “This week I feature a DJ from Durban called Wobbly and the theme is a combination of two provinces. The last DJ I featured was Sliqe,” he said.
