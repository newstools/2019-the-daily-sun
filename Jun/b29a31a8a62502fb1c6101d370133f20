PHILIPPI East cops in Cape Town recovered stolen goods after a tip-off from residents. Police spokesman Captain Bheki Xulu said they were happy with residents’ commitment to fight crime. “Our communities will be safer if we continue to work like this,” said Xulu. Police found building material which was stolen at Kwa-Faku Primary School in Lower Crossroads, Philippi East. Xulu said the suspects started stealing the material from 6 June. “The criminals broke into the containers as the school is being rebuilt,” he said. The suspects took building material and tools estimated at R200 000. Xulu said one of the suspects was arrested and will appear in the Athlone Magistrates Court soon. “The suspect was charged with possession of stolen property. The police are following other possible leads to arrest more suspects.” Migcobo Nkuhlu (38) said they sometimes didn’t trust cops. “Nothing will stop us now that the community has started working with them. We now know our communities will be safe if we work together,” said Migcobo.
