RESIDENTS  were excited when they received a letter from the municipality stating that vacant land would be given to them. But the excitement of the residents of extension 2 in Zithobeni, near Bronkhorstspruit, east of Tshwane, was shortlived. The residents claimed a letter from the City of Tshwane stated their councillor would allocate the land to them. They said they waited patiently for her and decided to build shacks on the land after they didn’t hear from her. But the Tshwane Metro police and private security evicted them 10 days after they built their shacks. Residents said they moved there without the councillor’s approval because they realised she didn’t care about them. Darlphonia Motaung,one of the residents, said they pleaded with the councillor to get them stands. She said when she didn’t help them, they wrote a letter to the municipality asking for land. “We were very happy when they responded to our plea. We thought our prayers were finally answered, but we were clearly wrong, as we are homeless again.” Another resident, Nomsa Mahlangu (37), said they were treated like animals when they were evicted. She said their belongings were damaged and some of their zinc sheets were taken by the Metro police. “They never gave us an eviction notice, they just came and bulldozed our shacks as if they were rubbish,” she said. Councillor Nomvula Mathenjwa said the reason she couldn’t let people take the land was because the city was still trying to make the place liveable. “We can’t let people live in a place with no water or proper sanitation. Most of the people we evicted were not on the list of people who should live there anyway,” she said.
