IN his bid to resurrect his career, almost forgotten midfielder Sifiso Myeni is training with Highlands Park with the hope of earning a deal. The former Orlando Pirates star winger has been clubless since he was released by Bidvest Wits at end of the 2017-18 season, and spent the whole of last season without playing football. Actually, his last official game in the PSL was 14 months ago in the colours of Wits, before being released. According to a source, Myeni is hankering for a return to professional football and is currently training with the Tembisa-based team with a view to clinching a contract. “Sifiso is training with Highlands Park as we speak,” said a source. “The club is assessing him but can’t say whether they will sign him or not. He is eager to impress the technical team. The coach knows his qualities but it is up to Sifiso to work hard and impress.” However, Highlands’ director Sinky Mnisi would not be drawn on whether Myeni was indeed being undergoing an assessment at the team. “I know nothing about what you are talking about. I cannot comment,” said Mnisi. Myeni’s achievements says a lot about his undoubted qualities. He has won two league titles and two top-eight trophies. The 31-year-old also lifted the Nedbank Cup twice, first with Wits and with Orlando Pirates and has five Bafana Bafana caps. It is not the first time Myeni is attempting a comeback, having tied his luck Chippa United in January. But things didn’t work out for him at the Port Elizabeth-based. Jooste was released by Durban-based Golden Arrows at the end of last season, where he spent three years. The PE-born player’s contract wasn’t renewed by Abafana Bes’Thende. “I can’t say anything much on the matter. The clubs will have to comment,” said Jooste when quizzed on his move to Gauteng. The former Bloemfontein Celtic player is the second acquisition for Highlands in the current off-season after they snapped up Makhehleni Makhaula from the relegated Free State Stars.
