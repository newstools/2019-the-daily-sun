FORMER Lily Mine workers are planning to recover the container in which their colleagues were buried three years ago. Solomon Nyirenda, Pretty Nkambule and Yvonne Mnisi died when they were trapped in the mine in Louieville, Mpumalanga, after a rock fall. Harry Mazibuko, representing the mine workers, told Daily Sun they decided to start planning the recovery. “We are left with no choice but to retrieve this container ourselves as government and mine management aren’t doing it. “We believe in the law and have spoken to the mineral resources department for years but they didn’t respond,” he said. He said it was clear government and mine management didn’t want to retrieve the container. Last year, business rescue practitioner Rob Devereaux said R300 million was obtained to resume the search this year. Former workers, locals and families of the trapped workers have been camping at the mine since 30 April, demanding the reopening of the mine which collapsed in 2016.
