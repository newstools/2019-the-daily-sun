JOBS are scarce and desperate people rarely realise that they’re being conned. And this is what has been happening at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. A job seeker gave Daily Sun a tip-off last Thursday. The SunTeam phoned the cell number on the job ad. The number was identified as Maxwell Bara. The SunTeam arranged with Maxwell to bring CVs to the hospital on Friday morning. He asked for a R2 500 cold drink, saying we’d be placed in a job that day. He told us to make a deposit at an ATM at Bara Mall and put the slip in an ID book when bringing the documents. But the SunTeam asked him to rather get the money himself. He refused. Mlungisi Sibiya (28) from Protea Glen, Soweto, said he was scammed in the same way. “But I’ve got no job and owe a mashonisa,” he said. Hospital spokesman Nkosiyethu Mazibuko said: “Government jobs are not for sale.” Soweto cluster police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Thebe said Diepkloof cops were probing many fraud cases. Thebe said no arrests have been made yet.
