DUE to a backlog at public hospitals, people with breast cancer often have to wait a long time to receive treatment. To address this, the surgical team at Khayelitsha Hospital in Cape Town teamed up with Tygerberg Hospital’s breast cancer unit and launched a surgery project on Tuesday. A specialist from Tygerberg performed procedures on four patients with various types of breast cancer. Western Cape Health spokesman Sithembiso Magubane said: “The aim is to minimise the waiting time fortreatment. This project will create decentralised care as Tygerberg Hospital remains the only facility which provides mammography services. The aim is to establish a breast clinic service in Khayelitsha’s healthcare system over time.” Magubane said the general surgery department at Khayelitsha Hospital was working to create an assessment clinic to fast track the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. “In preparation for this service, a number of nurses at Khayelitsha Hospital completed training in breast care in May.” Titi Klaas from Makhaya was one of four patients who was operated on. Speaking after her surgery, she said she was happy to have received the service at the hospital. “I’m thankful. I’m still recovering but I’m hopeful I will get better very soon,” she said. The other patients were also recovering.
