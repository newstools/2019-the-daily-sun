Even though his side were knocked out of the U-20 Fifa World Cup early, SA U-20 national men’s team coach Thabo Senong has managed to take the positives from the campaign. Amajita returned home yesterday following a rather disappointing World Cup in Poland where they failed to make it out of their Group -for the second time in as many tournaments. They finished bottom of their group with one point from their three matches, the same as in the previous edition held in South Korea in 2017. The SA juniors lost two matches, 5-2 to Argentina and 1-0 to Korea Republic, and drew 1-1 against Portugal in their last match of the tournament. Despite their early elimination from the biennial international men's youth football championship, Senong believes his charges have grown and will have taken some valuable lessons. “Our group very tough must be honest,” admitted Senong. “But as a coach, I have learnt a lot from every game. The games that we played and even the ones that I watched. “More importantly, our players have also learnt a lot and the future belongs to them. “It was their platform to develop and I hope they can take these experiences and go further in their career. “Tough luck to our boys because we didn’t pick up the points we needed.” Out of the four countries representing the African continent at the tournament, South Africa are the only team that did not qualify for the knockout stages. Mali, Senegal and Nigeria have all progress to the next round and will be flying the African flag high. Senong has tipped 2019 Africa U-20 Cup of Nations (Afcon) runners up Senegal to go the furthest out of the remaining teams from the continent. “They have done well to go to the next round, we wish them the best,” added Senong. “I’d be happy if they all go to the last 8 and last 4 but I must say that this tournament has been one of high quality, it’s tough to say who will make the top 4.”
