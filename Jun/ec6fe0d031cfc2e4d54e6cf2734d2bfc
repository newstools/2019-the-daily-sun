LONG serving  ANC MP Nomaindia Mfeketo has quit as a member of parliament. The once Cape Town mayor was  Human Settlements  Minister before being left out of President Ramaphosa’s new cabinet announced last week. According to TimesLive,her resignation letter is dated May 31 and addressed to National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise. In the letter she tendered  her immediate resignation and thanked the ANC for the opportunity to serve as a public representative. Mfeketo told TimesLIVE in a phone interview that she will be focusing on community work as well as working with local NGOs, on top of her work as an ANC national executive committee member. "There is nothing fishy about this. If you do not resign, you lose your ministerial pension, it goes down really badly and if you are of age like me, you may as well leave parliament and create space for younger people," she said. She turned 67 three days ago, on June 2. "I am looking forward to claiming back my life and to enjoy life as an ordinary person," she added. Mfeketo was the deputy speaker of the National Assembly for five years between May 2009 and May 2014. Then president Jacob Zuma appointed her deputy minister of international relations and cooperation in 2014.
