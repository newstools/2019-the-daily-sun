THE parents of the boy who went missing on Saturday want his kidnappers to spend a long time in jail. An unknown man abducted four-year-old boy from outside a church in Clairwood, Durban. His mum, a 32-year-old from G Section in Umlazi said she was attending prayer classes while the boy was playing with other kids in the fenced property. “When a car drove into the premises, the gate opened and my son went out,” the mum said. She said camera footage showed the boy was playing near a motorbike parked outside the church. The rider came out and asked the child questions. “We think he was trying to find out who he was but they had language problems,” she said. The mum said he called another man. “The man looked helpful and friendly but then he walked away with him.” She said spreading the news that the boy was missing helped, because on Monday, people spotted the kidnapping suspect in the same street. “He was caught with the help of the police. He directed the police to a house where my son was found sitting with his girlfriend.” She added they want the suspects to be arrested. “They kept my son for three days instead of taking him to the police,” she said. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed Isipingo police bust two suspects aged 26 and 29 for kidnapping on Monday. “The kidnapped four-year-old boy was found at G section in Umlazi. The suspects will appear in the Durban Magistrates Court soon. The boy was allegedly kidnapped in Clairwood on Saturday,” he said.
