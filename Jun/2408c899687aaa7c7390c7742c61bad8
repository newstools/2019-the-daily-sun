RESIDENTS of Zithobeni in Bronkhorstspruit, east of Tshwane, have been sleeping with one eye open! They said two bodies were discovered in their kasi over the weekend. When the first body was found in the early hours of Saturday morning, residents thought the was just another crime victim. But they were shocked when another man was found dead the following day. Although the two bodies were found in different areas, residents suspect someone could be on a killing spree in their kasi. They want police visibility at night. Resident Manqoba Mtshweni said their kasi has become a playground for criminals. He said the crime rate has gone up and they don’t have a police station in their area. “Police need to intervene before we take the law into our own hands. If the person killing us is not found by the police, the community will find them and we won’t be merciful,” he said. Constable Munyadziwa Phungo could only confirm that one person was found dead over the weekend and that two suspects have been arrested. She said the motive for the killing was still unknown. Phungo confirmed that there have been murders in the kasi but said they didn’t happen every weekend. “They happened once after two weeks. We sometimes go a month without any cases being reported,” she said. Phungo said cops have been assigned to patrol the area night and day.
