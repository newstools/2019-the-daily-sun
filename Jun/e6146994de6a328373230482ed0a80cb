TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula is angry about the crash between a bus and a Toyota Quantum that killed 24 young people over the long weekend. He said there would be consequences. Yesterday, he told traffic cops in Polokwane, Limpopo that steps would be taken to stop reckless driving. “Most cars are moving coffins. All unroadworthy vehicles, including trucks, must be taken off the road. “People don’t want to take responsibility for drunk and reckless driving. “If you accept being driven by a drunk driver, it may lead to death,” he said. Mbalula said he would fight until road deaths end.
