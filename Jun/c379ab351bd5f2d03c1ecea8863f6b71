LIFE turned into a nightmare when Molly Maluleke lost her birth certificate in 2007. The 26-year-old from extension 2 in Mookgophong, Limpopo got the shock of her life when she applied for an ID in 2016. She was told someone had changed her name to Liena Maluleke and she could not apply for an ID. Molly told Daily Sun Home Affairs officials told her to bring an affidavit, letters from her primary school and clinic and a copy of her mother’s ID. “I submitted all the documents in February 2016. I was then told they would investigate but nothing has happened. “Whenever I enquire, I’m told they’re still busy. How can they take three years to investigate without results?” She said in March, she was given a form to complete so they could change her ID number but she hasn’t had any feedback. “I was forced to drop out in matric. I once got a job and only worked for three months. I had to quit when they wanted an ID to register me.” Molly couldn’t go to the clinic when she is sick as they also ask for an ID. “I’m afraid of what will happen to my baby when I have one. I need help because there is nothing I can do with my life.” Provincial Home Affairs manager Albert Matsaung said the matter will be watched closely and resolved urgently. “Investigations showed Molly is the rightful owner of the identity document. She was requested to submit a renouncement letter to finalise the case.”
