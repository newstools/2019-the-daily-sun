IN a joint
sitting in Parliament to debate the State of the Nation Address, Juju said President
Cyril Ramaphosa must stop dreaming. The EFF leader Julius Malema touched on several issues
including land reform, Reserve Bank and how the President’s SONA lacked
details. Malema said: “We want a President that is ethical, honest,
and opens up to say how we fix a mistake that was committed in my name.” “How can any ordinary man walk into a shop, holding R100 in
his pocket, with the power to buy a cold drink, arrive at the shelves and say
to the shop keeper - "I dream of buying a cold drink?” He said Ramaphosa must stop dreaming because he is the
President of the country. “You are an implementor, you’ve got the power make thinks
happen. You want a bullet train, STOP dreaming.” “Announce how you are going to do the bullet train,” Malema
said.
