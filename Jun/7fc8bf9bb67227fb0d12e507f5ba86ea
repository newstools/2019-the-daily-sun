VUKA, Vula! Those were the words residents of Nancefiled Hostel in Soweto woke up to in the middle of the night. The raid on Wednesday came after Constable Nhlamulo Vuyeka (28) was shot while on patrol at the hostel. The unit stopped a suspicious car and its occupants started shooting. The cops contained the situation and bust the culprits. Vuyeka was shot on his abdomen and died in hospital. Captain Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun that Operation O Kae Molao took to the streets and hostels of Soweto and resulted in the arrest of over 300 suspects on Wednesday and yesterday. “The suspects were arrested for serious and violent crimes that include murder, armed robbery, fraud, assault, rape, car hijacking, possession of stolen motor vehicle and possession of drugs,” said Makhubele. He said the operation was led by Premier David Makhura, Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko and Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela. Makhubele said the suspects will appear in various courts soon.
