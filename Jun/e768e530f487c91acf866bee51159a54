 Three men died and eleven others were injured when a
bakkie and a taxi crashed on R82 in the Walkerville area. ER24 spokesman, Russell Meiring said several people
were found scattered around the scene. â€œWhen paramedics assessed the patients, they found
that two men in the taxi and one in the bakkie had sustained numerous, fatal
injuries," said Meiring. "Unfortunately, nothing could be done for them
and they were declared dead. Eleven other patients were attended to on the
scene," he added. Meiring said three were found to be in a critical
condition while eight others had sustained injuries ranging from minor to
moderate. "The patients were treated for their injuries and
the critically injured provided with advanced life support interventions. Once
treated, one of the critically injured men was airlifted by a private medical
helicopter to a nearby hospital," said Meiring. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance
to nearby hospitals. The details surrounding this incident are not yet
known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
