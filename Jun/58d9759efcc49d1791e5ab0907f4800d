Caster Semenya will
race in the 800m  at the Stanford
Diamond League on June 30 in her first outing over the distance
since she launched a legal battle against new rules targeting athletes with
hyperandrogenism. The double Olympic champion was cleared to compete in the
event after Switzerland's top court upheld her appeal against an IAAF ruling
obliging women with higher than normal male hormone levels to artificially
lower their testosterone before competing in races at distances of 400m to the
mile. "Caster's representation requested that she be
moved from the 3,000 meters (where she was originally entered) to the 800
meters and we are happy to comply," Prefontaine Classic's
director Tom Jordan said in a tweet on Tuesday. An initial appeal by Semenya was struck down by the Court
for Arbitration of Sport in Lausanne, leading to her appeal to the country's
top court. Earlier this week the South African accused the IAAF of
using her as a "human guinea pig" as they "experiment with how
the medication they required me to take would affect my testosterone
levels." The race on June 30 in the US will be her first race over
800m since winning gold at the Diamond League in Doha on May 4. This month's meeting has been moved from its usual home in
Eugene to California as the stadium in Oregon is being renovated for hosting
the 2021 World Championships.
