SOCIAL crime prevention programme volunteers marched to the KZN Community Safety Department on Friday. The protesters demanded better treatment and gave the department until Monday to respond to their grievances. Bongekile Mbutho (44), one of the leaders of the march in Pietermaritzburg, said they were tired of being taken for granted. She said they started working for the department in 2008. “A lot of things have happened over the years but the last straw was in March when we were given indemnity forms to sign. The forms stated our stipends were going to decrease from R2 480 to R1 635.” She said it was insulting as they were working hard to ensure the safety of residents. Carol Mhlongo (50) said they were also unhappy about news the department wanted to move them to a private security company. “We see this as a strategy to fire us because some of us are approaching pension age. No private security company will hire so many people close to retirement,” she said. Department head Themba Mavundla said: “We are giving you an assurance we will attend to all the grievances you have raised.”
