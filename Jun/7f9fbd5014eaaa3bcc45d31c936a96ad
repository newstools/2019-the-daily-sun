METRORAIL regional manager Richard Walker is happy that seven people have been convicted for stealing and damaging Metrorail infrastructure. “The region has access to excellent investigative and forensic resources which strengthen Prasa’s cases in court and upskill our security teams. “The evidence presented is compelling which is why most of the accused pleaded guilty,” said Walker. He said despite many successful convictions, scrap dealers still disobeyed the law. “Illegal metal trade remains harmful to the economy and compromises Prasa’s modernisation of the rail system.” Among those convicted were Mpololo Mbanga, who was arrested in Khayelitsha last May for the theft of 2,6 metres of underground signal cable. He was given a sentence of three years in prison. Oesman Mohamed and Leon Smith from Bishop Lavis were sentenced to 10 years, five of which were suspended. They stole approximately 21 metres of underground cable valued at R20 000. Mark Boonzaaier was handed a 12-year sentence, of which six years were suspended. Walker thanked cops and the NPA for their successes and said he would keep working closely with them. “We continue to work closely with the police to ensure crime prevention resources are directed optimally,” said Walker. He said most of the stolen items were recovered.
