TV and Radio personality Luthando 'Lootlove' Shosha was blessed with a set of twins early this year and she did let us in that Motherhood is not a walk in the park. The new mom who took to Instagram to post a Video where she tell her followers than she now has a 'mom dress' and they should meet up and have a support group is back at work and shared how she once lost out on a R250K brand deal because she was pregnant during a chat on The Sobering podcast with Lee Kasumba and Ayanda MVP. "I lost a 250k cheque because I was pregnant. That was cold," she said. "That was a wake-up call. It didn’t matter at the time because my health mattered. I took 2 seconds because you know what, I told myself that God is gonna give me quadrable. It’s fine" the mother of two added. Much Love to new moms, especially twin moms! ?? s/o to new Moms getting back into the work life for the first time. I wake up with a plan everyday and everyday the girls change my plan... lol! Much love to the more experienced Moms who help, support, share stories, have helped and been so kind when i’ve been moving around with the girls, Moms who tell you you look Good when you feel like the bottom. Still King Loot though... don’t get it twisted! ?????? Getting this work, I just need to find my balance! ?? A post shared by  Luthando LOOTLOVE™ Shosha (@lootlove2) on May 14, 2019 at 8:03am PDT
