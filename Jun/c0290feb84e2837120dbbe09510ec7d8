TEACHERS at Masuku Primary School fear for their lives after the murder of a colleague. Sibonakaliso Nyawose (48) was gunned down by an unknown man who followed him to the school in Folweni, south of Durban, on Tuesday morning. After the shooting, the gunman walked to a getaway car waiting a few metres away. A teacher said there had been unrest at the school since last year. “The principal left mid-last year because the school was too big,” said the teacher. “The department earlier brought another teacher to be a second deputy principal, but we already had one. “We were later called into a meeting and told the deputy principal had been made acting principal.” The source said most of the teachers were unhappy about changes. “The acting principal started coming to school with a gun, threatening that blood would be spilt,” said the source. According to the teacher, nine teachers stopped reporting to school and went to the local circuit office daily for around a month earlier this year. “The department then suspended the acting principal as they saw the matter was getting out of hand,” said the source. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: “We dealt with death threats and, as you known, an acting principal was suspended after being accused of threatening teachers and coming to school with a gun. “However, at the moment we don’t want to speculate as the situation could get out of control. “While we look into the matter of security, we will offer psychological help to pupils and teachers. We will wait for the police to do their job.”
