KAIZER Chiefs have confirmed the acquisition of Ghanaian midfielder James Kotei, who joins from Tanzanian champions Simba SC. The 25-year-old has penned a three-year deal with Amakhosi. He is Chief's second signing ahead of the new season, following the arrival of Zambian international striker Lazarous Kambole.After finishing in a dissapointing ninth spot last season, Chiefs have done some overhauling of their squad. They released eight players in recent weeks. Kotei was crowned Simba's midfielder of the season in 2018/19, having played a pivotal role in their CAF Champions League campaign, in which they reached the quarterfinal stage for the first time in the club's history. He made 12 appearances from the preliminary round and lasted less than 90 minutes on just one of those occasions.
