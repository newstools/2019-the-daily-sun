Susan
Shabangu, the former minister of social development and minister for women in
the presidency, has officially resigned as an MP, Parliament has confirmed. Parliament
spokesperson Moloto Mothapo confirmed Shabangu's resignation in a statement on
Thursday, which outlined the composition of the sixth Parliament of South
Africa. "There
are currently four casual vacancies [vacancies arising from resignations after
being sworn in] in the National Assembly. This is due to the recent resignations
of Ms Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba, Ms Susan Shabangu and Ms Nomaindia Mfeketo from
Parliament. In addition, President [Cyril] Rampahosa ceased being an MP when
the NA [National Assembly] elected him as president of the Republic on May
22," read his statement. Shabangu
joins a growing list of former ministers and ANC MPs who have resigned this
week. News24
earlier reported that these MPs included Letsatsi-Duba, the former state
security minister, and Mfeketo, the former minister of human settlements. The three
were part of a group of 14 former ministers who did not make it into
Ramaphosa's new Cabinet that was announced last week. SOURCE: NEWS24
