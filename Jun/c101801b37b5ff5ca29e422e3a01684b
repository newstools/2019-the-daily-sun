TO this day, the late Sam Nzima’s photograph of Mbuyisa Makhubo carrying a dying Hector Pieterson – with his weeping sister, Antoinette Sithole, alongside them – symbolises what came to be known as the Soweto Uprising. It was early in the morning on that fateful day 43 years ago when pupils from Soweto high schools marched to Orlando Stadium. They were chanting slogans and carrying placards in protest against the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in black schools. There was a large presence of heavily armed police. What was supposed to be a peaceful protest turned violent when police tried to disperse the crowd. Hastings Ndlovu (15) and Pieterson (12) were the first pupils to be shot and killed by police. In 1996, in her testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Antoinette said she believed Pieterson was caught in the crossfire. Primary school pupils were not part of the march. “Maybe because of curiosity, kids from all primary schools followed us,” she said. “At first I was very, very angry. But later I realised that Hector didn’t die in vain.” She said all they wanted was the scrapping of Afrikaans so later generations could enjoy school. “We couldn’t do that because of this Afrikaans. I’m very happy because things have changed,” said Antoinette. The following morning, more armed police were sent to the area. The uprising later spread to other parts of the country and into the following year. About 700 people were killed. Tsietsi Mashinini was identified as the leader of the uprising. The Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum was opened in Soweto in 2002 to honour the young man and those who died during the 1976 uprising.
