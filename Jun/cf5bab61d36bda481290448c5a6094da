MAMELODI Sundowns owner and African Rainbow Minerals chairman Patrice Motsepe has denied he pledged R22 million to any Botswana political party or individual. According to Sandile Langa of the company’s legal department, Motsepe “did not pay or contribute a single cent for political purposes or in connection with the presidential election in Botswana.” “These false and defamatory allegations gave rise to the legal action that was recently initiated in Botswana. We do not want to get involved and have no interest in the politics of Botswana or the developments of any party,” said Langa. He said Motsepe was often requested to meet prominent international business leaders, philanthropists and former heads of state. According to some reports, Motsepe is demanding about R6,7 million from the Botswana newspaper, Sunday Standard, for defamation. Langa said: “The request for him to have a brief, courtesy meeting at OR Tambo International Airport with former president Ian Khama was agreed to because of the old family friendship and ties between their families.”
