ONE moment they were happily enjoying the sweets they had just bought during break from a fellow pupil. The next they were crying and complaining of stomach pains. Their faces had also become swollen and painful. Some of the pupils were vomiting, while others complained of loss of energy, and there was panic and chaos. Frightened teachers scrambled for transport to rush the 30 sick pupils to hospital and the local clinic. These were desperate scenes at Makeni Primary School, outside New Hanover in KZN, on Tuesday. On hearing the news, some parents rushed to the school. SGB chairman Khehla Sithole confirmed that several pupils fell sick at the school on Tuesday. He said two pupils were admitted to hospital. He said the rest were treated at the clinic and discharged the same day. “Tests were conducted, but so far we don’t know the results,” he said. He said the incident affected teaching and learning as the rest of the pupils were released to go home early. Schooling has since gone back to normal. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said inspectors had been requested to investigate the issue. “We will also contact the police so they can investigate what kind of sweets these were and what they contained. “Based on our findings, we will take action,” said Mahlambi. Daily Sun recently reported that several pupils from Albini High School in Intshanga, also in KZN, fell sick and had to be rushed to hospital after allegedly eating a kota filled with gravy and viennas.
