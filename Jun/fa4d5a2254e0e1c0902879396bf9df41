VILLAGE farmers joined hands to build a dip in their area. The farmers from Muledane in Thohoyandou were gatvol of having to travel a long distance to use the cattle dip in neighbouring Tswinga. The Muledane Livestock Farmers Association had to do something. Not having a cattle dip affected the farmers badly, and its members were tired of losing livestock to diseases. Many farmers who’d lost their livestock to diseases ended up giving up. The dip was launched during a function on Wednesday attended by many farmers from the village, who all said they were excited. One of the association’s leaders, Ntshengedzeni Tshiwandalani, said it had been an uphill struggle for farmers whose livestock had diseases as they suffered big losses. He said they sat down together and realised they could not wait for government to help them. “For years we’ve been without a dip and we felt we could do things ourselves,” Ntshengedzeni told the People’s Paper. “We collected some money from members and approached government, which gave us poles for the project. “We’re happy that we no longer have to travel to Tswinga and that vets are a phone call away if we have problems.” Ntshengedzeni said they were expecting the new cattle dip to boost business. Ntshengedzeni called on farmers who operate on their own to come on board and join their association so that they can speak with one voice. He said as farmers they were worried that there was no new blood joining the sector, which could mean the village would suffer in the future. “We still have many plans as an association,” Ntshengedzeni told Daily Sun “We want to build an abattoir and other facilities that would help improve our farming businesses. “With the unity shown here, we’re bound to go very far.”
