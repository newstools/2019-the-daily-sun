TWO Walter Sisulu University students were stabbed to death at a freshers braai in Mthatha over the weekend. University spokesman Yonela Tukwayo said one of the victims was a third-year office management and technology student, while the other, who was found on the N2 road on Sunday morning, was an environmental sciences student. “We still don’t understand how someone with weapons managed to get inside the venue when there was security. University management is extremely shocked,” she said. Tukwayo said five injured students were being treated in hospital. “Management is often accused of being heavy-handed when security is beefed up, but when we go back to standard security, management is accused of slacking,” she said. Tukwayo said management was in meetings to find ways to assist affected students deal with the trauma. Police spokeswoman Captain Dineo Koena said two cases of murder were opened, but no arrests were made. SRC publicity officer Asanda Mtshezi said there was not enough security at the party. “We send our condolences to the bereaved families and hope security is tight at the next event,” she said. Convocation president Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi said he hoped the police would investigate thoroughly and make arrests soon.
