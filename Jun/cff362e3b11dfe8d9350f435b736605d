The rape lawsuit against soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly been withdrawn. But according to Kick Off, this is not end of the case as yet. Last year Kathryn Mayorga made international headlines when police from Las Vegas in the United States announced they had reopened an investigation into a rape accusation by her where she claimed Ronaldo raped her in his Las Vegas hotel penthouse suite in 2009. The five time Ballon d'Or winner has denied the accusations. He allegedly had been avoiding the authorities to be served a summons to appear in court since the file was made by Mayorga who is also from Las Vegas. Kick Off quotes Bloomberg who earlier today reported that Mayorga has decided to drop the lawsuit in Vegas. But the soccer publication also notes Der Spiegel journalist Rafael Buschmann, who was part of the team of investigators that broke the news of the accusations for the German publication in September confirmed the case was dropped in the Nevada state court. However, it has now been escalated to the US Federal court.
