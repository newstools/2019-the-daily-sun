On 12 and 13 July Koketso will be running in the 161km Washie 100 marathon from Port Alfred to East London to raise money for Ebenezer Children’s Home in Evaton in the Vaal. The logistics master’s graduate from Phokeng in the North West said running helps her cope. SK, as she’s also known, lost her mum when she was one and her dad when she was 10. “I had to live with my father’s family, learn to fend for myself, and be responsible. Running was the answer. It helped me to be disciplined.” SK adopted the home, which cares for 30 children, in 2015. The building is not in good condition and SK wants to make sure the kids have a beautiful, warm place to live. “I’m hoping to raise funds to refurbish the home,” she said. She said every child deserves a shot at a better future. “My mission is to motivate kids and encourage them not to let circumstances define their destiny.” SK asked for a donation of at least R2 for every kilometre completed, or R161 for completing the race, to help support the home. Building materials and paint are welcome.
