A nurse is one of the Mamelodi Hospital staff members in hot
water for the incident where a 76 year-old gogo was filmed chained to a steel
bench. Now  Democratic
Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) is coming to her defence and
challenging her being placed on special leave. New Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku had said a nurse,
security guard and two doctors had been implicated over the incident that
happened to gogo Martha Marais. According to EyeWitnessNews, Denosa held a briefing in
Braamfontein on Wednesday. They said they had written to Masuku with reasons why the
implicated nurse should not be placed on precautionary suspension. “This person was only on duty for an hour when the incident
occurred. When would she have had the opportunity to offer [any] care?” The nursing union's Bongani Mazibuko said the nurse in
question did not have any contact with the elderly woman when she reported for
duty. Provincial chairperson Simphiwe Gada said the union was
calling for an independent body to take over the investigation as the process
had already been compromised. “The Department of Health is already compromised in our
view. They have already prejudiced the mess through their actions like
misinforming the public.”
