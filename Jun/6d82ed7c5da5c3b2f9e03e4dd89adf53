MANCHESTER United striker Romelu Lukaku says it is up to the club to clarify his future after being heavily linked with Inter Milan. Newly-appointed Nerazzurri coach Antonio Conte has put the striker towards the top of his wanted list as he looks to revamp his newly inherited squad, but hammering out a deal is easier said than done. It is thought United would be willing to sell for a fee of about R1.4 billion, but as things stand the Belgium international remains at Old Trafford. Lukaku has been continually linked with a move to Inter and Serie A rivals Juventus, but he is giving nothing away after claiming his future was all down to United to decide. “It’s up to the club,” Lukaku said about his future. “The club have to come out with statements. I’m not here to entertain any rumours. “I just play my football and we’ll take it from there.” Inter could also have to cash in on Mauro Icardi before they can wrap up a deal for Lukaku so it looks like being a busy summer for Conte at the San Siro. – SPORT24
