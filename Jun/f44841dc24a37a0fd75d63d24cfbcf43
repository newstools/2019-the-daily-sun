A GRUESOME discovery has left residents in shock. This after they woke up to find the lifeless body of a gogo lying next to a stream in Newtown, Inanda on Sunday. The body of the unknown gogo, believed to be in her 60s, was first seen by a resident who was walking past the stream, who told other residents. A resident said there were bruises all over the gogo’s body and a lot of blood on her thighs. “I was called by other residents to come and see if I recognised the gogo. “But nobody from our area knew who she was,” said the villager. Another resident said perhaps the gogo was raped and beaten before being killed. The resident said they hoped her family is traced soon so they can bury her. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated by Inanda SAPS. “She had head and body injuries. The matter is still under investigation,” said Gwala. Gwala said the woman is still unknown and hasn’t been identified by anyone. “We appeal to families whose loved ones are missing to contact Inanda cops,” said Gwala.
