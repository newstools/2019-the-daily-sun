The winner of the IdolsSA competition, Yanga Sobetwa, has finally released her debut album. The season 14 star, who captured Mzansi’s hearts on the show, released her album Promised Land last month. The album has lit up social media and gets people singing to her songs. Yanga told SunBuzz she’s happy that people enjoy the album. “I released the title track Promised Land before my album, and people were head over heels in love with it. I knew they’d appreciate the album. “It taps into feelings people don’t want to talk about and, as much as the songs are fun, they also speak to people. Fans who’ve already heard it love it, and those who haven’t should get it.” Yanga said season 11 winner Loyiso Gijana inspired her. “After seeing Loyiso, I was motivated and decided to use the contest to build a fan base. “I wanted to be a gospel singer and for people to know me. I wanted God to use me to get through to them. I knew the contest would be perfect for that.” The 18-year-old said her mum initially didn’t want her to be a contestant. “I learned a lot from IdolsSA, which I wouldn’t have by myself. The journey was exciting and nerve-wracking, and I’m grateful to have gone through that experience. “I couldn’t believe I won. It kicked in at times, but I’d forget about it. That’s how unbelievable it was.”
