LISAKHANYA Mbizo is the pride of her village. Next month, the 11-year-old from Ncembu Village in Ugie, Eastern Cape, will be jetting off to Los Angeles in the US. She’s going there to show off her acting skills at the International Presentation of Performers convention. The grade 6 pupil at Mthatha International School was chosen after she auditioned in Durban in April. She said she was excited about the opportunity. “I started acting this year. I hope to get an agent in America so I can be in an international movie.” She said her favourite actor is Chris Hemsworth from Australia who stars in Avengers. Her mum Chuma (30) said Lisakhanya has always loved acting. “She sometimes played different characters to make everyone laugh at home. “I never imagined this but I’m so proud of her,” Chuma told Daily Sun. “I hope my daughter makes it big because I want the best for her. “I’m so grateful for the support she’s been getting from the sponsors who paid for her trip.” Lisakhanya’s drama teacher Sipho Hlongwane said she is a very talented young girl. “I teach my pupils to perform with confidence. I hope Lisakhanya will secure a role in an international movie,” he said. Principal Nomava Madikizela said she wishes Lisakhanya well. “She will be representing the school and the country, and we’re all proud of her.”
