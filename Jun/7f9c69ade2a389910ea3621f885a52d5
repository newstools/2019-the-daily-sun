ONE of the few remaining struggle heroes, Andrew Mlangeni, turns 94 today. Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg are only two surviving Rivonia trialists, the apartheid era trial that saw Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other sentenced to Robben Island in 1964. Unlike Goldberg who is wheelchair bound, madala Andrew is still fresh and fit. Last month he attended EFF leader Julius Malema’s gogo’s funeral in Limpopo. Later the party posted a video of Mlangeni joining grave diggers, carrying a shovel, helping to cover the grave.      Today the Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson  Amos Masondo, expressed well-wishes to the icon. “The nation is honoured to have in its midst one of the few remaining fathers of our liberation, who continue to serve as the quintessence of wisdom, integrity, morality and selflessness. Dr Mlangeni’s lifelong, uncompromising commitment to social justice, democracy, equality, human rights and development of our nation is an inspiring historical legacy that will continue to inspire future generations in South Africa and the world”, they said in a statement. “The love that Baba’Mlangeni has for this nation, the sacrifices he paid and was prepared to pay for freedom, democracy, equality and development is testimony of a remarkable human being and an outstanding leader. Even at his age, he still possesses a sharp mind that continues to serve as a fount of wisdom from which we derive guidance and which constantly rebukes those in leadership never to steer away from the principles and objectives of our national democratic revolution. His active commitment to the service of our nation continues to inspire us to do better”, they added. “We wish Dr Mlangeni good health, strength and contentment as he enters yet another important milestone of his life, whose significance we honour and celebrate as South Africans.”
