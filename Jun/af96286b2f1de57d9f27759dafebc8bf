A MAN appeared in the East London Magistrates Court yesterday for illegally circumcising four boys. The 30-year-old was bust in Scenery Park on Tuesday after the boys, aged between 14 and 15, were found at an illegal initiation school. Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders CEO Mzwethemba Nkantsu said they hoped the accused would be kept in jail for the rest of the season. “We’re very happy he has been arrested, to show we are not playing when we say people must not circumcise boys illegally,” he said. Traditional affairs spokesman Mamkeli Ngam said they were encouraged to see more arrests being made. “We are sending the message that the rule of law must be respected by all people,” he said. Magistrate Linda Magaxeni postponed the case to next Friday for a formal bail application.
