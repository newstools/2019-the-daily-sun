BEING a teenager can sometimes be too much. And dealing with anxiety and depression on top of it is hard. As an anxiety sufferer, 17-year-old Nqobi Mamba saw the need to be a shoulder to lean on for others. He started an initiative to assist those affected by the condition. Nqobi, from Badplaas in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun that dealing with anxiety was a daily battle, but he talked about it in order to cope. “It’s been three years since I was diagnosed and every day is a challenge,” said the teenager. Asked what happens when he gets an anxiety attack, he said: “I start having fearful thoughts. I get stage fright when I’m supposed to talk and become nervous about small things during social events. “I used to take medication to control my disorder, but it didn’t help as I would always feel drowsy and tired.” He said through the initiative, he and his four friends counsel other pupils about anxiety and depression. He said they planned to host a silent march next month as it is Mental Health Awareness Month. He said they wanted to spread the word about anxiety and depression to as many young people as possible.
