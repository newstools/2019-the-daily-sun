AS Mzansi observes Child Protection Week, a 19-year-old pupil at Vuluhlanga Senior Secondary School in Butterworth is expected to appear in court soon. He was bust on Thursday for allegedly stabbing another pupil (19) with a spoon at school over food. Child Protection Week comes at a time when stabbing, bullying and gang activities in schools are rife. In January, a 14-year-old pupil was allegedly stabbed to death by a fellow pupil at Mpekweni Primary School in Peddie. Last month, three primary schools in Port Elizabeth’s Northern Areas were closed for a day after rival gangs shot at each other in front of the school gates. New Education MEC Fundile Gade said: “We condemn violent behaviour by pupils and call on society to assist in stopping behavioural challenges in schools. “We also call on parents to work with us by playing a meaningful role in helping to stop adverse behaviour.” Provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci told Daily Sun: “Police go to schools across the province to educate pupils about crime and search for drugs and weapons.”
