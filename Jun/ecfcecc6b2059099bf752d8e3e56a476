THEY live in RDPs but they still walk in muddy streets. Residents of Missionvale, Port Elizabeth, said every time it rains, everything comes to a standstill. Dylan Plaatjies (20) told Daily Sun: “The water just comes straight into our RDPs. The houses get flooded and the streets take a long time to dry because the place is muddy because there are no drains.” He said they have to put gumboots and plastics on their feet to catch a taxi in Old Uitenhage Road. “What’s even worse is that water from Smartie Town houses comes straight into our homes. “We have been living this life for too long,” he said. Kwanele Simons (27) said: “When we call an ambulance or the police, they don’t come because they get stuck in the mud. We are forced to carry sick people to the main road.” He said the houses were built in 2013 and they were promised the drainage system, but nothing happened. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki was sent an inquiry last Wednesday but didn’t respond. His boss Mzubanzi Jikazana was also contacted on Thursday and promised to ask Mniki to respond, but he had not done so at the time of going to press.
