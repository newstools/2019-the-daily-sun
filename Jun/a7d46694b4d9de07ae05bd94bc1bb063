THE South African under-20 team bowed out of the Fifa Under-20 World Cup on Friday evening after a 1-1 draw with Portugal. The result saw Amajita and the European champions missing out on the round of 16 at the World Cup. Amajita will head home after finishing bottom of Group F, having lost their two previous matches at the showpiece event in Poland. Thabo Senong’s charges opened the tournament with a 5-2 loss to Argentina’s Albicelestes before dropping three more points against South Korea with a 1-0 loss. Now history is following them and they look set to board a plane back to Mzansi without a point in Poland, a repeat of the 2017 World Cup where they finished bottom of the group. Rafael Leao kicked things off for the Portuguese in the 19th minute. Amajita won a penalty in the 52nd minute after the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) adjudged Diogo Leite to have handled the ball in his attempted clearance. James Monyane stepped up and converted from the spot kick to level matters.Just five minutes later Portugal were awarded a penalty of their own in a near-identical situation; this time South Africa's Fezile Gcaba was the handball culprit. But Kubheka came up big to save Jota's ensuing spot-kick. Portugal controlled the ball for most of the remainder of the match, but South Africa were unrelenting, winning their first point at Poland 2019 while sending the Portuguese packing.
