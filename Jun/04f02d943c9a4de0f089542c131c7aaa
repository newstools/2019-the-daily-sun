A 30-year-old former police officer who is serving a 15-year
sentence for several armed robberies at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre has
been pretending to be a Hawks official. The former officer has reportedly been pretending to be a
Hawks official in order to extort money from high-ranking cops. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the
former TRT police official who masqueraded as a Brigadier from the Hawks was
traced and arrested on Tuesday after several high-ranking police officials and
other private individuals complained that they were allegedly being intimated
and extorted to pay millions of rands. He allegedly claimed that he had incriminating evidence
against them and demanded large sums of money in exchange for destroying case
dockets. “The intimidation and alleged extortion was referred to the
Serious Organised Investigation team who after months of probing led them to
the correctional centre and confiscated cell phones and various simcards. “It has not been established if he was working with other
individuals at the centre,” Mulaudzi said. Mulaudzi said last month the Hawks arrested 40-year-old
Gabriel Paul who also impersonated a senior investigator. “Paul abandoned his bail application on 05 June 2019.
Investigations are still underway to link him to other cases of fraud and
impersonation,” Mulaudzi added. Paul will appear in court again on 16 July 2019 at the
Krugersdorp Magistrate's Court.
