The school drop-out rate is high, with nearly half the country’s pupils leaving the schooling system before matric. Unless a young person passes matric or gets a tertiary qualification, their chances in the labour market are slim. They are unable to improve their chances of employment by growing their skills. The value of a matric certificate for many black families remains a huge achievement. That is why this milestone must not be taken for granted. Passing matric gives a person significant benefits, as compared to not having one. Pupils must be encouraged to finish grade 12. They need to be told that matric is very important for their future. They have to realise that without matric, the future looks bleak. Real change needs to take place in the early phases of pupils’ education, if the country is going to properly address challenges in the higher education sector, and encourage pupils not to drop out before completing grade 12. Government has consistently committed to putting youth development high on its agenda. A matric certificate is valuable and is the best tool to use to get out of poverty. That is why I’m so worried about the basic education drop-out rate and primary school crisis in impoverished communities. Most young people need to study further.
