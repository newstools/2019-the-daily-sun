WHEN a matric pupil who allegedly drove into her son wasn’t arrested last week, Eunice Rahlane gave up on justice. However, the 32-year-old mum from Ga-Motupa, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, was relieved yesterday when the boy accused of killing her son Koketso (14) and his father was arrested. The mum told Daily Sun: “Although the arrest will not bring my son back, I am relieved that he’ll face the law.” The accident happened just outside Mohlatlego Machaba Secondary School. The suspect was allegedly showing off in his father’s bakkie last Monday when he crashed into pupils sitting under a tree. The 18-year-old suspect appeared in the Bolobedu Magistrates Court yesterday and the case was postponed to next Friday. He’s facing charges of culpable homicide, driving an unroadworthy motor vehicle, and driving without a valid licence. His 54-year-old dad was charged with allowing his son to drive the bakkie without a valid licence. Prosecutor Sibasa Ramothibedi told the court to delay the father’s appearance because the police charged him with culpable homicide, although he wasn’t present when the accident happened. Seven other pupils who survived the crash were discharged from hospital, but one girl is receiving medical attention. Koketso will be buried in his home village of Ga-Motupa this weekend.
