SOME drivers seem to think that it is a must to switch on the fog lights under any weather condition. But that’s not the main reason. Fog lights are designed to be used when visibility is severely restricted, chiefly by fog and poor visibility. They are designed to make you more visible rather than help light up your way. So, they are not needed when visibility is good at night. Instead, use your headlights. Fog lights can only be used when your car’s main lights are not well-lit to make you visible to other road users. Generally, when you can’t see for more than 100m ahead you, switch them on. Of course, fog lights won’t make you invincible. Use common sense. If you can’t see very far ahead, slow down and keep a good distance from the car in front of you. In foggy weather, the roads are also likely to be slippery. Give yourself more room to brake and slow down. If the fog has cleared, switch your fog lights off as you risk dazzling other drivers.
