The official sponsor of the Uefa Champions League, Heineken, hosted a spectacular sporting weekend with legendary footballer Thierry Henry here in Mzansi over the weekend. A Crossbar Challenge with SA celebrities Maps Maponyane, Sphectacula & Dj Naves, Lunga Shabalala and Bohang Moeko was organised in a fun day in Johannesburg. They were joined by local footballers Steven Pienaar, Aubrey Ngoma and Thokozani Sekotlong. Henry was in the country to promote and watch the Uefa Champions League final that was won by Liverpool, who defeated Tottenham Hotspur in Madrid on Saturday. Henry is still a darling of the Arsenal supporters after he spent eight years at the club, scoring an amazing 174 goals in the 254 games he played for the Gunners. He later went to Barcelona in Spain and also had a fantastic time playing and winning the 1998 Fifa World Cup with France. However, he faced a stiff competition from Mzansiâ€™s twinkle-toed celebs who were eager to beat the highly-respected Frenchman. But in the end, the Crossbar Challenge was won by Mamelodi Sundowns player Thokozani Sekotlong.
