HIV support groups play an important role in local communities. While people should visit local clinics for help, these organisations do more than enough to ensure that patients living with Aids are taken care of and take their medication on a regular basis. Not only do they bring medication to patients, but they also help them with day-to-day needs. People Against the Spread of Aids and Starvation (Pasas) is a home-based care organisation in Ga-Mohlophi, Limpopo. The all-women organisation visits houses of patients, especially those who are too ill. They also make sure patients take their medication on time. Mama Maile, project manager at Pasas, said they also give away free male and female condoms. “We also visit schools, taverns and shopping malls to educate more people about safe sex and how to look after themselves when they are infected.” She said they not only cover Ga-Mohlophi, but also go to other neighbouring areas including Driekop. The 18 women divide themselves into small groups to make the task easier. Mama said with some patients not having anyone looking after them, they become family to these patients. She said people shouldn’t undermine support groups and caregivers. “We do a lot to save lives. Some of our patients have no energy to walk themselves to local clinics to fetch medication and that’s where we step in.” Meanwhile, Durban will host the ninth SA Aids Conference from tomorrow. The four-day conference will end on Friday. Professor Refilwe Phaswana-Mafuya said the HIV and Aids epidemic continues to spread throughout the world. “Sadly, Mzansi remains the front-runner. This according to figures shown by recent research reports,” she said. This year’s conference themed: Unprecedented Innovations and Technologies – HIV and Change, aims to re-energise and revolutionise the response to the Aids pandemic in Mzansi.
