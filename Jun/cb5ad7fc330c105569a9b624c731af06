T he inaugural Cothoza Awards recognise and pay homage to people who have played the role in making isicathamiya and a capella music accessible to a wide audience. The Grammy Award-winning group Ladysmith Black Mambazo has made a name for themselves over the years at home and internationally. Last year, they scooped their fifth Grammy for the album, Shaka Zulu Revisited. The group will host its isicathamiya awards, known as the Cothoza Awards. The three-day event takes place on 22 June at the Durban Playhouse, in KZN. Speaking to SunBuzz, Sibongiseni Shabalala said the awards was something his father and group founder Professor Joseph Shabalala always dreamt about. Shabalala founded the legendary group 60 years ago. “This year we do not have categories. As a way of introducing the awards we honour people like Solomon Linda and Bhodloza Ndimande. Winners will receive special medals in recognition of their contribution to the upliftment of isicathamiya,” he said. Sibongiseni said they will be bringing music industry hot shots to teach young artists about the genre. “We’ll be exploring the evolution of isicathamiya with the theme, Evolution of Isicathamiya: The Past, The Present and The Future, through discussion.” He said the awards will raise awareness and create a sustainable market for the music genre as well as teach the young generation to be proud of their own music.
