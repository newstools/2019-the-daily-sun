  TEARS flowed on the faces of the family members of the murdered Daniel Bakwela after the accused in the case was granted bail. Mohammed Mawela was granted R5 000 bail at the Joburg Magistrate Court. The decision to grant bail was not well received by the bereaved family who were in tears and had hoped that bail was denied. Mawela faces one count of murder and two of attempted murder after stabbing three ‘gang’ members allegedly in self-defense.
