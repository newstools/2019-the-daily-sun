ETHEKWINI mayor Zandile Gumede’s supporters were not happy
with the decision to remove her from office. They planned to invade the ANC provincial media briefing in
Durban yesterday. But the plan was cancelled at the last minute after they
were told ANC provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala would meet branches late
yesterday to explain the decision. On Monday, voice clips from the supporters circulated,
saying they were going to disrupt the media briefing as they did not agree with
the mayor’s axing. Mzo Dube, the leader of the supporters, said they believed
Gumede was being targeted as the party had never acted against mayors in
similar situations. “We didn’t march because we don’t want to be seen as
fighting the organisation, but we want it to be consistent. What happened to
innocent until proven guilty rule, which the ANC has been using for
years?”  he asked. Provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said the party was not
targeting anyone, but had to protect its image. The briefing was delayed for an hour because Ntuli had to
meet the disbanded eThekwini regional committee. He confirmed that Gumede and
eThekwini ANC councillor Mondli Mthembu had stepped down on Monday. He said Newcastle mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba agreed to also take
30 days leave, but the party would meet him this weekend after he announced
last week that he would not step down.
