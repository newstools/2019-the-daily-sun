MARITZBURG United have announced the signing of central defender Kwanda Mngonyama from Cape Town City. The lanky defender return to Pietermaritzburg after a two year-spell with the Citizens. Despite being just 25-years-old, the tough tackling former Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits player will bring a wealth of experience to the Team of Choice. The KZN side, who recently tied down coach Eric Tinkler to a new 2-year contract, are hoping to build a strong team for next season as they look avoid getting caught up in a relegation dogfight again. “Kwanda is a KZN boy who wanted to return home,” said club chairman Farook Kadodia. “A deal has been finalised with Cape Town City and we welcome him home with open arms. “He did very well for us in his previous spell, and being familiar with the setup in Pietermaritzburg, Kwanda will be able to hit the ground running and will provide another excellent option for coach Eric Tinkler in our defence. ”They are also closing in on a permanent deal for striker Judas Moseamedi from the Citizens.
