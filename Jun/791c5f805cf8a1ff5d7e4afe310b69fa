DARREN Keet says he is not
bothered by the lack of offers for his services. The Bafana Bafana goalie
is focusing firmly on the upcoming the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Keet rejected a contract
extension at Bidvest Wits, and now finds himself without a club. But that is the least of
his worries. “Offers? No, I haven’t
received anything,” says Keet. “There are no offers from
overseas yet. But that is not a problem for me. I’ve got my agents dealing with
that and they’ll let me know accordingly when the time is right.” Keet is eyeing the number
spot in the Bafana team, competing with Ronwen Williams and Bruce Bvuma for the
jersey. And that seems to be his
primary preoccupation at the moment. “I’m not dealing with the
offers at the moment. I’m not too bored. My job now is to focus on what we are
currently doing in Dubai. From Dubai it is Egypt and then the first Afcon game. “That’s where my focus is
on.” The 29-year-old has been
linked with a move to Mamelodi Sundowns, but he has sounded keen to go back
overseas.
