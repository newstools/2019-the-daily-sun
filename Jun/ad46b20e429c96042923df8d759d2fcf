HE came armed with nothing but a Bible and said some prayers. Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng of Incredible Happenings Ministries held a night sermon at his church in Katlehong on Friday, called Destruction of Witchcraft, to get rid of evil spirits. People attending the sermon said they were victims of these spirits. Mboro apparently told them to bring soil from their yards for him to step on with prayer and take it back home for deliverance. Mboro said: “Witchcraft is carried from one generation to the next. Some of you are where you are because your parents were cursed . Some of you have nothing. You need to break the cycle of witchcraft and look up to God.” Just after midnight, people started confessing their pain. Mboro laid his hands on them and they said they felt a sense of relief. Maria Mekoa (39) said: “I have so much anger and I’m an alcoholic. I’m dating a jailbird. There’s nothing good in my life. “I’m losing weight and getting darker in complexion, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong. “People use me as they please. “I struggle to pay my rent because nothing I try succeeds. I haven’t seen my daughter because I don’t have money.” She fell down and Mboro laid his hand on her, cursing evil spirits to leave her body. “I’m burning,” Maria screamed. Another woman said she had the money to renovate her house, yet couldn’t do it. She wept: “My tiles are broken and my ceiling is in a bad state. I’m failing to fix my house. My son is still waiting to be compensated after 10 years.”
