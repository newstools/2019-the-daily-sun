SILVER was just a little boy when his life changed forever. He was herding cows when his feet failed him. Silver Tembe (39) from Manguzi, northern KZN, said something strange happened one day when he was herding cows. He said the cattle started making a strange noise. “I was a bit confused and tried to follow them, not knowing it was a trap. I suspected a ghost had them, but quickly ignored it. “All of a sudden my feet could not move for a very long time until someone called me. But I couldn’t feel my lower body,” he said. He said they carried him home, thinking he would be fine. “Days passed without any change. I was then taken to hospital.” He spent four years doing different tests as doctors couldn’t find out what was wrong. “I was admitted to hospital from 1988 and was discharged in 1992 without any results. “I couldn’t attend school or find work, so I joined an art group. I was taught to make grass mats and various items. “I now make grass mats professionally and people place orders in bulk. I told myself I couldn’t just sit at home and wait for hand-outs.” He also fixes electrical appliances such as irons and heaters. “I still believe I have to work for things despite what happened to me. My condition doesn’t control me. I’m in charge of my life. “Disability found a shelter in me, but I am the owner of my body. I will do whatever I want,” Silver said.
