A FAMILY is devastated by the death of their loved one. And they blame City of Joburg’s Emergency Management Services for his death. This was after a fire broke out in South Hills, Joburg, on Sunday. Rhoda Pieterson (47) lost her son Remano (29) in the fire. She said she received a call at about 9pm to say that her son might be trapped in the fire, which they couldn’t put out. She said they called firefighters, who arrived three hours later. She said when firefighters finally got there, the truck had no water and they went to fetch water elsewhere. “I don’t understand how they left the station without water. My son would still be alive if they had come on time with a truck full of water,” said Rhoda. Remano’s sisters Yonack Stillies (24) and Chanteleen (22) told Daily Sun this was the second time a truck had arrived at a fire without a supply of water. Yonack said the first incident happened in January. City of Joburg’s EMS spokesman Robert Mulaudzi told Daily Sun firefighters followed procedures when servicing a call. “When a fire engine arrives at a scene, they have to identify and connect to a hydrant for the water supply as the water in the fire engine is not sufficient and cannot last more than five minutes,” said Mulaudzi. “It is impossible for fire engines to leave the station without water as the procedure requires that the engine is filled from a hydrant immediately after firefighting has concluded.”
