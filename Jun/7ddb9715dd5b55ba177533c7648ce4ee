NEDBANK Running Club athlete Edward Mothibi has won the 2019 Comrades Marathon. The 34-year-old South African ultra-distance runner, who finished fourth last year on debut, took top honours this year after coming in with a time of 5:31:33. Three-time Comrades champion Bongmusa Mthembu came second with a time of 5:31:58 Japan’s Nao Kazami, who is the world 100km record holder, came third in 5:39:16. Mothibi has proven that he packs a punch after taking home the R500 000 winners’ prize money. South Africa's Gerda Steyn won the women’s category in a credible time. The Nedbank athlete stopped the clock in 5:58:53, lowering the 2004 record of Iena Nurgalieva, 6:09:23, by 10 minutes as she smashed the up-run record on her way to victory. Russia’s Alexandra Morozova and Irelands’s Caitriona Jennings came in second and third with times of 6:17:40 and 6:27:15 respectively.
