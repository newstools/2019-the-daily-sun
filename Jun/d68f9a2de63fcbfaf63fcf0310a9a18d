THE onus is on David Notoane to save South Africa blushes when they face Malawi in the Cosafa Cup Plate Final at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium. The early elimination of the South African Under-20 side, Amajita, from the Fifa U-20 World Cup in Poland, and their early exit from the Cosafa Cup, has raised some eyebrows. Now Notoane, who travelled with his Under-23s to Durban to prepare for the two-legged Caf Youth Championship qualifier against Zimbabwe in September, is now working on repairing the damaged image of Bafana Bafana – a name they have been using at Cosafa Cup. The winners of the Youth Championship, set for Egypt, will qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. They qualified for the Plate Final after defeating Uganda on penalties. Said Notoane: “The biggest thing to take out of the win over Uganda was the reaction from the psychological reaction of the players. We were on the verge of going home after Uganda scored early. “We’ll go back and correct, and improve on our performance because as you know, the main target is the Olympics. “I’m happy that we came to this tournament. I would rather make mistakes and learn from Cosafa Cup.” Meanwhile, Bloemfontein Celtic goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto is likely to start in the final ahead of SuperSport United’s Reyaad Pieterse. Mpoto, who was part of the Amajita side that went to the Fifa Under-20 World Cup in South Korea in 2017, saved two penalties in the semi-final against Uganda. The winner of this final will take fifth spot overall, and will walk away with R100 000. Botswana will face Zambia in the tournament final at Moses Mabhida Stadium tomorrow (3pm).
