WITH most companies looking to hire skilled and experienced people, the youth is left with no opportunities. This also leaves them unable to gain the experience they need to become employable. Commercial manager for Gauteng’s Workforce Staffing Temporary Employment Services, Jeandi Leone, told SunEducation this is the reason why they decided to create on-the-job training, learnerships, job placements and experience for young people. She said the latest quarterly labour force survey from Stats SA showed a 54,7% unemployment rate for the ages 15-24 years and a 33% unemployment rate between 25 to 34-year olds. The stats show that the unemployment rate for those aged 25-34 is double that of 45 to 54-year olds. “While one can understand the desire for businesses to employ experienced candidates, this approach is creating a vicious cycle in South Africa,” said Leone. She said inexperienced people are unemployable and are unable to gain the experience they need to make themselves employable. “TES providers want to curb this by providing flexible staffing and other employment solutions based on their clients’ operational requirements,” she said. “For the youth, employment through us helps them to get a foot in the door with well-established organisations, which can help them gain experience for future employment.” Typical industries that make use of TES workers include the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, fast moving consumer goods, wholesale and retail, transport and logistics industries, to name a few. “With the global drive toward automation and digitisation, it is more important than ever to upskill the youth and ensure they are empowered to perform the jobs that are available.”
