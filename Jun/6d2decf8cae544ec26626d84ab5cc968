COMMUNITY members have been warned against a new trick thugs are using. Dumisani Qwabe, secretary of the Nyanga CPF in Cape Town, told Daily Sun criminals opened outside taps to get residents to go outside their houses. He said when people went to check outside and close the taps, the thugs ran into their houses. “People must not go out and leave their doors open. They must wait until the morning or call the police before going out,” said Qwabe. He said thugs sometimes also moved pipes and positioned them in such a way that water would flow into the houses, forcing people to open their doors to go and check on the problem. “They have been doing this for quite some time and most people do not report these cases,” he said. Qwabe said he knew it was hard for people to sleep with water from their taps outside being wasted. But he said it was the best way to ensure their safety. “People need to report these things to the municipality so when the water bill goes up, they have an explanation.” Mzukisi Ndinisa (37), who is afraid of high water bills, said: “It would be hard to sleep if the water was running outside but we are grateful for the warning.”
