POLICE in Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge, in Mpumalanga have arrested a woman found in possession of suspected stolen property. The 42-year-old from Hluvukani Village was found with suspected stolen copper cables worth R5 000 at her home. According to Captain S’fiso Nyakane, police received a tip-off from community members over the weekend. The woman allegedly runs a factory manufacturing pots. “Police responded swiftly and searched the house. She didn’t explain who had brought the cables to her home. “That’s when she was arrested and charged with possession of stolen property,” said Nyakane. The woman is out on R1 000 bail following her appearance in the Mhala Magistrates Court. Her case was postponed to 16 July for further police investigation. The dead man, 75-year-old Robert Mlambo, was allegedly knocked down by the taxi while on his way to offer condolences to his late brother George Nwavele’s family. George (65) was killed after he and his colleagues were held up at gunpoint by four thugs during an attempted business robbery. Anyone with information that can assist the police is asked to contact Captain Alfred Mashele on 082 968 4153 or Mhala police on 013 773 0331.
