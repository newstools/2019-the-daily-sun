 A 33-year-old man has been arrested in Tzaneen during a
major drug operation. Tzaneen cops uncovered a drug lab in a house in the
outskirts of the Tzaneen CBD. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspect
believed to be the drug lord, was arrested for manufacturing and concocting
drugs. “During the process of searching this lab, a high quantity
of dagga and mushrooms, which were in the processed stage, were discovered.” The police also recovered three shot gun live rounds. Ngoepe said the estimated value of the recovered drugs is
about R200 000. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon, on charges
of manufacturing drugs and possession of unlicensed ammunition. He said this milestone achievement comes after the arrest of
another suspect for a similar crime he committed in the Tzaneen Policing area
this year. Ngoepe said the 62-year-old suspect was on the 11th
February, arrested during an intelligence driven joint operation for
manufacturing drugs at a house in the Tzaneen CBD. The drugs recovered had an estimated value of R500 000.
