Hey MizzB I’m a 24-year-old woman who has been in a committed relationship with this guy for the past three years. He is a great man and I want to have a life with him, but I can’t stop cheating on him. The problem is that I am now cheating on him with his friend. Other men keep approaching me and I do not like saying no. Am I addicted to cheating?
