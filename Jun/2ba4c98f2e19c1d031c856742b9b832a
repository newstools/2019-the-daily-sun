THE Eastern Cape Health Department is getting rid of dead wood. On Wednesday, several officials were either fired or suspended for misconduct. Spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: “An admission clerk caught on video doing rounds while drunk at Port Elizabeth’s Livingston Hospital has been fired. “In April, a patient in need of help took a video of the drunk clerk. “The move to fire him shows the department won’t sit back and do nothing against officials who bring the department into disrepute by failing to do their jobs.” Cala Hospital CEO Lulamile Sizelo was suspended for allegedly feeding patients food which did not meet the department’s standards. Kupelo said: “The patient diet was a disgrace and should never have been allowed. Two supervisors at the Mthatha forensic facility have been issued with letters of intention to suspend them after claims of misusing a state vehicle over the weekend. “They were given three days to explain why they shouldn’t be suspended. The facility is facing an investigation after the disappearance of a body that was admitted for an autopsy in January. “Such incidents will not be tolerated. It cannot be business as usual with officials doing as they please.”
