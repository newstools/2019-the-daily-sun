LIMPOPO businessman Collen Mashawana opened his heart and wallet to a couple in Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane. The Afribiz Invest chairman took to social media to share how he built a new house with a solar geyser for the lovebirds, who are both living with a disability. He handed over the fully furnished house on Saturday and posted a photo of the hand over on his Facebook page. “The lovely couple were not born with disabilities. Mrs Nyathikazi had a stroke, which left her right side paralysed, while Mr Nyathikazi has diabetes and his right leg was amputated,” he said. Collen said the couple, who he met a few weeks ago, have no children. “The house they have been living in was dilapidated, with cracked walls and windows in each room. The doors were broken and the roof was leaking,” he said. “The new home caters for a family living with disabilities. It has four bedrooms, a dining room, separate bathroom and toilet, lounge and garage. Collen wished the family well in their new home. “No person living with a disability should live in a life-threatening structure or under conditions that could contribute to their health deteriorating. Our foundation prioritises building homes for the elderly and people living with a disability.” Last month, Collen and his team handed out blankets and food at Vakoma Home For Frail Older Persons in Soweto. Many Facebook users applauded him.
