FURIOUS residents demanding jobs blocked roads and vandalised ANC offices on Wednesday afternoon. The protest in Rouxville, Free State, started with residents marching to the local municipal buildings peacefully. However, hell broke loose when protesters learned no one from the Mohokare Municipality was going to address them. They threw stones at the municipal offices and threatened to burn the building down. Motorists on the N6 highway had to use alternative routes as the road was barricaded. Protesters claimed they were promised jobs and better services before the election but were still waiting for officials to tell them how they would keep those promises. A protester told Daily Sun: “We are shutting everything down until our demands are met. “We were told before the election that we would be getting jobs. “Municipal officials made door-to-door visits to ask for our votes for jobs. Until they come to speak to us, no one will work at the municipality. “We have barricaded roads so that officials can see we mean business,” said the protester. Municipal spokesman Lehlohonolo Mafatman said residents were angry about jobs advertised by the municipality. “They want the municipality to follow a certain hiring method. “The council will sit down and discuss a way forward and the proper way to hire. “We encourage everyone to apply for the posts,” he said. Police spokesman Sergeant Yanga Ngcukana said one person was arrested and charged with public violence. “This was after residents disturbed traffic. An ANC building was vandalised, doors were broken and windows were smashed. “Police visibility remained high in the area,” he said.
