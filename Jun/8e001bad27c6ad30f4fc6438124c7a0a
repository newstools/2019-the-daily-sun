PUPILS at four schools can now heave a sigh of relief! This after their toilets, which had been closed for over two months by an angry contractor, were re-opened for use. On Friday the Grahamstown High Court ordered Siyaphambili Trading not to intimidate, threaten, harass or assaultdepartment of education employees or members of the school governing body. Daily Sun reported that toilets at Tantseka, Gwegwe, Julukuqu and Xwili junior secondary schools in Mthatha were shut down by the contractor over claims he was owed money. The order prevents the contractor, agents and employees from entering the schools’ premises. It reads: “The deputy sheriff is instructed and authorised to enter the premises of the schools and do all things necessary to remove all locks, chains and barricades that prevent access to and use of the toilets.” Over the past two months pupils had to relieve themselves in dongas and open fields. Tantseka principal Raymond Maxwebisa said: “We really struggled over the past two months. It was hard. Teachers had to ask to use our neighbours’ toilets, while pupils used open fields.”
