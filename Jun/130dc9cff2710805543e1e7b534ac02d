STUDENT activist Mcebo Dlamini plans to ask new NPA head Advocate Shamila Batohi to consider withdrawing the 2016 charges he is facing from the Fees Must Fall protest. This was reported by TimesLive as Dlamini appeared in the  Johannesburg Magistrate's Court earlier today. He is still facing charges of public violence, theft, malicious damage to property and assault. TimesLIVE reported that his lawyer, advocate Olelwa Siqongeana, told the court they intended to make fresh representations to the National Prosecuting Authority's (NPA's) recently appointed national director of public prosecutions, Batohi, to consider withdrawing the charges as they were politically motivated. "The former acting NDPP, advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi, declined our initial representations but we intend to make new representations to advocate Batohi," Siqongeana said. She told the court this would determine whether the matter would proceed. "We also received copies of the docket but we are awaiting video footage from the state before we can proceed on the matter." But magistrate Carlo Labuschagne said he could not set aside the matter pending the outcome of the representations as he was the stand-in magistrate in the matter. "The representations are not part of the criminal process and I cannot wait for the outcome. I am going to postpone the matter to July 4 in order for a pretrial conference," Labuschagne said. Dlamini was arrested at a Wits University res during the protests for free education in October 2016. During his previous appearance, Dlamini’s counsel, advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, told the court that he would be making fresh representations to the NPA since there was now a new NDPP.
