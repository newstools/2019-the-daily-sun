MINA Malapo (48) has finished her sangoma training, but she can’t leave the gobela’s practice. That’s because she can’t pay him. The no-nonsense 23-year-old gobela said she can’t leave until she has at least paid half. Mina needs about R20 000 to graduate, but she’s unemployed and can’t raise the money. “I trained her and she needs to get money for intwaso and I can’t use my money to get her intwaso,” said gobela Silas “Manzini” Tshabalala. He said she needs two goats and a cow but the frustrated Mina from Magagula in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said she tried to raise the money but couldn’t as she had five kids to feed. Mina said she needed: “I thought my family would help but they’ve turned their backs on me,” she said. Mina said she’d been sick as she was running away from her calling and was shown sangoma Manzini in her dreams to be her gobela. “He has been good to me and I don’t want to leave this place without paying him. “I have become healed and I want to carry out my ancestors’ wishes. I appeal to people to help me so I can go work,” Mina said.
