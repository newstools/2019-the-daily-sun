WHEN the officials get to work every morning, they are greeted by a bad smell from the basement and have to use masks to do their work. But despite allegedly paying R4 million rent each month, officials at the Emfuleni municipal building told Daily Sun they suffered from headaches and TB. Some said they had to have operations due to bad health caused by being exposed to sewage spillages over a long time. They said the municipal manager ignored their grievances for over six years. The building was closed in recent months after workers refused to continue working iin the bad conditions. The SunTeam visited the building yesterday, which still had a bad smell. Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union representative Moses Mohosho told Daily Sun: “We complained about the smell, which caused headaches, itchiness, chest and sinus problems “Municipal management failed to help us. No measures were taken to protect workers. Our letter of grievance had no response.” Mohosho said the department of labour’s notice to close the building in April was cancelled, allowing workers to go back to work. On Monday, the department issued another notice to shut down the building. Health and safety representative Puleng Sekelem said she had to stay away for four months.“I went back to work and got sick again. I found there was raw sewage in the basement. My grievances were ignored.” Emfuleni spokesman Stanley Gaba said workers had deserted their work stations. “They faced challenges including sewage spillages which led to bad odour in the basement and two floors. Yesterday, workers, manager Dithabe Nkoane and mayor Gift Moerane met to find a lasting solution.”
