OFFICIALS in the Limpopo premier’s office are in hot water! The Hawks raided Premier Stan Mathabatha’s office on Friday to collect evidence in their investigation into allegations of corruption and misuse of funds regarding international trips. Hawks national spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said they worked on confidential information that suggested procurement irregularities and, based on this, there was a search and seizure operation that targeted five premises. “Among those is the supply chain office in the premier’s office. The inquiry is still ongoing and there are no arrests. We’re not at liberty to divulge the content of the docket,” said Mulaudzi. Staff members working with service providers allegedly faked the pricing of travelling and bookings fees, with the office getting billed more than twice for a single international trip. The premier’s spokesman Kenny Mathivha said: “Whatever they come with will assist the premier to clean whatever corrupt activity that may be going on. We will fully co-operates with them to ensure no stone is left unturned.” Norman Mavhungu of Nehawu said: “The Hawks’ intervention is to confirm and assert our view that the suspicions running around the office are getting necessary attention. “The first day the premier came into office, he was given a report about the dealings taking place in supply chain management, although no investigations were conducted.”
