IT’S not looking good for teams representing the African continent in the Fifa Women’s World Cup underway in France. Nigeria, South Africa and Cameroon all lost their opening World Cup matches since the tournament started last week. And the African prayer is that things must not get worse this week, when the teams play the second rounds. On Saturday, Banyana and Nigeria were humbled by Spain and Norway 3-1 and 3-0 respectively. On Monday night Cameroon, who were Africa’s last hope could not do any better as they were downed 1-0 by Canada at Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier. Now the question is: are African women’s teams not good enough to go toe-to-toe with their peers around the world? Banyana, who are in their maiden World Cup, might not have made a winning start, but they held their own against Spain. They learned the hard way as they found themselves on the wrong end of two penalty decisions that were inspired by the controversial Video Assistant Referee (VAR) calls. But they will have a chance to turn Africa’s fortunes around when they face China on Thursday. Nigeria have been dominating the African continent in woman’s football for a while now, having won 11 Africa Cup of Nations titles, and are the only African side to have reached the World Cup quarter-finals in 1999. The Super Falcons have not missed a Women’s World Cup since the competition began in 1991. However, after 1999 Nigeria have not made it into the last 16. On Wedndesday night they will be hoping to fly higher above, battling South Korea at The Stade des Alpes (3pm). After Cameroon’s narrow 1-0 defeat to Canada in Group F, it remains to be seen if the The Indomitable Lionesses will bark more than the next opponents Netherlands on Saturday.
