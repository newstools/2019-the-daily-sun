THE Hyundai Kona has funky looks, making it an eye-catching alternative if you are in the market for a compact crossover. It’s basically more of a hatchback on steroids than a full-on sports utility car, similar to VW’s previous CrossPolo. Hyundai is pitted against the likes of the Nissan Juke, Peugeot 2008 and Renault Captur. We tested the manual derivative which comes with a small capacity turbo-petrol engine. Besides the quirky appearance and funny name, the Kona’s list of standard specifications draw attention too. It come with a long list of tech features, including a seven-inch touch-screen multimedia system with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto functionality. The sound quality from the four speakers and two tweeters is second to none. The Kona has generous room for four passengers. Boot space is a mediocre 361 litres. But it can be increased by removing the hidden storage tray. It has a 1,0-litre three-cylinder turbo-charged petrol engine that provides 88kW at 6 000r/min and 172Nm torque at 1 500 and 4 000r/min. It is a perky engine that has enough punch for most everyday situations, while handling is on the neutral side. The Kona is also pretty quiet. Furthermore, its 17cm ground clearance makes it a competent car to tackle any gravel road. Safety is also key. Passive safety features include driver and front passenger airbags, complemented by curtain and side-impact airbags. In typical Hyundai fashion the Kona feels well-built and though there are some hard interior plastics, it feels solid in every aspect. In its segment, the Kona is an attractive buy. It also comes standard with the Hyundai warranty.
