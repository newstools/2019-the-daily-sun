THE dead are meant to rest in peace. But their rest was disturbed on Sunday by sounds of sirens, hooters and a huge bang! This after a car ploughed into tombstones at Laudium Cemetery, Tshwane. A number of tombstones were left damaged.  Ibraheem Dockrat of Laudium Disaster Management said they received a call about a driver who had lost control of his vehicle and ended up at the cemetery. “When we arrived we found about 10 graves damaged. We don’t know the cause of the accident or the identity of the driver.  “The scene was handed over to Tshwane Metro cops for further investigation.’’ A pupil was allegedly being taught to drive, but lost control of the car.  Metro police spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the matter was being handled by cops. Laudium police spokesman Constable Simon Chokwe said he could not comment as no case was opened. Residents were urged to visit the cemetery to check if their loved ones’ graves had been affected.
