THE Mpumalanga Education Department will deal with school violence at a safety indaba planned for next month. The issue is one of MEC Bonakele Majuba’s urgent areas of concern that needs attention from the department. Majuba said: “I noted with serious concern violence at our schools, and we will host a safety indaba so that together with other stakeholders we can develop a strategy to stop violence.” He was speaking to teachers, principals and representatives at the district education hall in Bushbuckridge on Thursday. This was during one of his district visits that started in Nkangala, Gert Sibande and Ehlanzeni. “As I take the reins, I’m aware of the conditions in the sector. “We need a permanent solution. Damaged Manyakatane Primary School in Newington needs urgent attention, as well as a plan to put Thaba Chweu Boarding School in operation next year. “Sybrand van Niekerk Hoerskool in Sabie is too old, so technicians must visit the school,” he said. “We have challenges of poor sanitation at schools, unreliable school nutrition and scholar transport, as well as construction of circuit offices and safety issues. “Some children have been learning in mobile classes for over five years, and that needs to change.” He said the province could achieve an 80% matric pass rate this year. “As a province we target 82%, but my vision is to drive Mpumalanga to number one nationally.”
