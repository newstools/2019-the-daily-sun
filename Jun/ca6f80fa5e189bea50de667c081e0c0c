The name Paulinah means a lot to actress Paulinah Mphethahanyi and her granddad. “I was named after my great grandmother, my mkhulu’s mother,” she said. Her granddad, Pastor William Mphethahanyi (88), has always had a special relationship with his granddaughter. “My great-grandmother passed on in the same month I was born. Her son calls me mama and I call him Mushavhi. He plays a fatherly role in my life.” Paulinahsaid her name also brings out her teaching spirit. “It could be the sharing of information or portraying a particular role on the screen.” She plays Mbali Tshedza in Isithembiso and also Didi in Muvhango. “Mbali started as a carefree young woman in 2017 and she could get anything she wanted, including somebody else’s boyfriend but the role has slowly developed to a date rape storyline,” she said. It raises awareness of how one can go out on a date but have your drink spiked and end up being raped. In Mbali’s case, she works at the Panther Club. “It can happen to anyone and it can be done by anyone. They may have beautiful women but they still do it.” Paulinah, a third-year LLB student at Unisa, was born in Ha-Raliphaswa Village, Nzhelele, Venda. Her fun-loving nature led her to acting. She joined Turning Heads talent agency, owned by Nonkululeko Ndlovu. “I became an extra but I wanted more,” she said. “Whenever I was in the studio I saw it as a space to learn. It inspired and pushed me to do better while attending acting workshops.” Paulinah describes her first auditions as horrible. “There was no connection with the character I was supposed to be portraying. “I was only interested in perfecting the lines. I just stood there like a talking robot. The only thing I did well was speak in my mother tongue, Tshivenda,” she said. Paulinah comes from the Vhashavhi clan.
