WHEN a Mozambican man saw people flocking to his country from KZN to buy handmade aluminium pots, he decided to make it easier and cheaper for them. He moved closer to them. Fifty-year-old George Mathusi moved to South Africa and settled in KwaMashu, north of Durban, last year so locals would not have to travel so far to buy the popular pots. Mathusi told Daily Sun he found a place in M Section that he turned into a warehouse to produce the pots. “I arrived here with people from Mozambique who know the work so we could teach the locals. I then hired locals and taught them how to make the pots,” he said. The father of three said making aluminium pots was not difficult, but tiring. He said he used sand to shape the pots. “The whole process of making a pot is done by us. The only thing I do is to buy sand,” hardworking George said. “We take an old pot and put sand inside it. When the sand is properly shaped we remove the old pot. The shaped sand is then placed on a platform from which we mould the new pot. “We put a small pipe on top of the pot and pour hot aluminium through it. “The aluminium is thenmoulded into the shape and size we want. Once the aluminium is dry, the pot is made,” he said. He said the finished products were distributed to shops, while some were sold on site. “I learnt to make this kind of pot while growing up. Luckily, I can support my family with the money I make,” he said. He said he decided to move to South Africa because of the high demand for the pots. “So far, I’m renting this place. But one day I believe I will own it,” he said.
