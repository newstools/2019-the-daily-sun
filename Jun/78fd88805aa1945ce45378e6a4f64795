ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairman Sihle Zikalala has thrown in his
thoughts on the recent social media spats at Luthuli House by the party’s
leaders. Last week the matter of the Reserve Bank saw party secretary
general Ace Magashule clash in views with ANC’s head of economic
transformation, Enoch Godongwana, and finance minister Tito Mboweni. TimesLive reports that Zikalala today spoke ANC’s provincial
executive committee (PEC) lekgotla in Empangeni and has lambasted party leaders
for using social media to air their differences instead of using internal party
structures to resolve them. " We’re revolutionaries and not celebrities. When we differ,
we should not differ on Facebook or Twitter but we should differ inside the
house. Leaders who undermine internal platforms must be brought to book,"
he said. Zikalala also called on the ANC to be responsible in its
communication strategy and answer to the people all the time. He said the ANC
needed to do more to connect with the people, especially those who lived in
informal settlements. "People living in informal settlements are becoming
hopeless. We need to interact closely with the people who live in informal
settlements and give hope to them," he said. Zikalala said only a united ANC could provide unity among
society. He said any platform must be about listening to the people
and addressing the needs of the people. .
