MORENA Montoeli loves his kasi – and he hates having kak flowing down the streets. Armed only with a single bucket and determination, the 39-year-old got down and dirty and cleared the kak-spewing manholes! The man from Bophelong, Vaal, said it was not only the smell but also the flies that made life a misery and even businesses closed down. The streets started breaking up and soon drivers were driving on the pavement. Using his own tools and money, walking knee-deep through dirt, nappies and crap, SunHero Morena started cleaning the two blocked manholes last week. “They were both blocked so it took some hours to do it,” he said. Morena was helped by Tshepo Makhele, who lives near the manholes. Tshepo and Morena started clearing the holes one bucketful at a time until both the holes were cleared. Morena is also fixing the street that was damaged by the continuous flow of kak. He said he uses small donations from sympathetic residents to buy material. “If I had enough money I would buy proper tools and even sand,” he said. Morena has called on SunReaders to help him finish fixing the road.
