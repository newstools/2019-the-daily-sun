SOUTH African Liberating Public Service Union leader Mbuyiseni Mathonsi has called on all teachers who own guns to carry them to school to protect themselves. Mathonsi blamed the education department for failing to provide safety for teachers and pupils. Sibonakaliso Nyawose (48), the teacher shot three days ago at his school, was a member of the union. Mathonsi said if teachers had guns, maybe Nyawose would be alive, adding the policy that prevents teachers from carrying firearms is unconstitutional and said his union plans to challenge it. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said he can’t allow teachers to turn schools into army bases. He expressed his shock over the killing of Nyawose. “We must meet during these school holidays so schooling is not disturbed,” said the king.
