ANYONE who suffers from disease hopes it will go away. What’s important is to see more action taken to raise the awareness around the disease to help safe lives. 30 May marks World Multiple Sclerosis Day. The aim of the day is to raise awareness around multiple sclerosis. More than 2,3 million people around the world have been diagnosed with the disease that affects the central nervous system and interrupts how the brain absorbs information that communicates with the body. In Mzansi, more than 5 000 people suffer from multiple sclerosis. This year’s theme was: “My Invisible Multiple Sclerosis”, which highlights the impact the disease has on the quality of life of those living with the condition. The day also aims to give a voice to everyone affected by the disease to share their experiences and understanding of the disease. Brian Eades, a patient who lives with the condition, said what makes him happy is that every year is that there are international campaigns aimed at raising awareness about the disease. He said this is made in order to challenge common misconceptions to help people understand how to provide the right support.
