ISAAC Mabula (61) is a devoted Comrades Marathon runner. He has already run 29 marathons and collected 29 medals. He will take part in his 30th Comrades Marathon on Sunday and hopes to come back with another medal. And to honour him, fellow runners made him a pacesetter, meaning he will hold the South African flag and set the pace for runners to follow. Isaac from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, looks like he’s in his 40s. He said running keeps him looking young. “I don’t have lifestyle diseases like diabetes, high-blood pressure or cholesterol because I train a lot,” he said. The madala started running the Comrades in 1990 and completed all his races, which earned him four silver medals and 25 bronze medals. His best time was seven hours and 10 minutes in 1997 when he was 35 years old. As age is catching up, he’s lost some speed. “But I challenge myself to get better in every race,” said Isaac. He thanked his family for being supportive and ensuring he ate healthy food. His dream is to run the 42,2km London Marathon in 2021. “I’ve already started training and hope for the best.” Besides the Comrades, Isaac has also taken part in other races such as the Two Oceans, Om die Dam, Loskop and Soweto and won. Lately, he mentors young athletes at the Katlehong Athletics Club.
