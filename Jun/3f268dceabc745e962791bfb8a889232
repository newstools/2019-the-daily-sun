THE couple had been together for nine years and were supposed to travel back home to Zimbabwe to finish the lobola process. But that’s all in the past now. The man from Berea, Joburg, told Daily Sun his sad story. He said not only has his woman disappeared, but she also stole R15 000. The man claimed that he’s now getting SMSes from another man telling him he won’t see his woman again. The angry man has opened a case of theft against the woman. “I just want her to bring back my money,” he said. He said the woman disappeared on 3 June and is not answering her phone. When the SunTeam called the woman, her phone was on voicemail. The couple is originally from Zimbabwe. The man said he knows his wife is cheating on him. “Why would another man send me SMSes to say he’s with her and I will never see her again?” The self-employed man said he’s been working hard and brought money home to give to his partner. “I even gave her my bank cards because she manages our house. I never thought that one day she would steal from me. “I work hard and whatever money I made was for us, but she decided to be greedy and run away.” He said a day before she disappeared, they were supposed to go to Zimbabwe to finish the lobola process. A case of theft has been opened at Hillbrow Police Station, and cops are looking for the woman.
