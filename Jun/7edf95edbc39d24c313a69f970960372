WAYNE Rooney rolled back the years to score an incredible goal from inside his own half for DC United against Orlando City on Wednesday night. The strike, shockingly reminiscent of his effort against West Ham whilst playing for Everton. The 33-year-old was inside his own half when he unleashed the effort past Brian Rowe to find the back of the net. With the game goalless just undwer 9 minutes, two Orlando players ran into each other whilst trying to start an attack. The ball bounced out to Rooney, who didnâ€™t even take a touch before lobbing the ball high over the unsuspecting Orlando goalkeeper, who was well outside his box. Fans immediately started drawing comparisons between the goal and his effort for Everton against West Ham back in 2017.   The goal was also similar to his other long-range strike against West Ham during his Manchester United days.
