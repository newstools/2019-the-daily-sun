CONSTABLE Sabelo Ndlovu (33) was a committed cop who loved his work. This was what his colleagues said at an emotional funeral in Tweefontein, near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga, on Saturday. He died in a car crash last Friday on the R544 between Verena and Emalahleni. He was killed along with his wife Elsie (28), his kids Minenhle (8) and Ntombikayise (6), and his nephew Luckia Masombuka (11). One passenger died in the other vehicle while three others were seriously injured. Middelburg commander Major-General Lillian Lentsoane said: “It feels good to talk about a clean member who served with integrity and did his work from the heart.” Thembisile Hani mayor Nomsa Mtsweni said: “The community has done a great job by coming together to bury the five family members with dignity.” Ndlovu joined the police service in 2008 and in 2010, joined the flying squad in Middelburg.
