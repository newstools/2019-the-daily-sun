 The Mpumalanga Department of Education has suspended a
26-year-old male teacher from Mabusabesala Secondary School in Weltevrede. The teacher was suspended for allegedly invigilating a grade
11 mid-year examination while holding a gun. This incident reportedly happened on Monday, 04 June 2019
while learners were writing the Tourism Paper. “The Department views this in serious light and has already
instituted an investigation to understand the circumstances that lead to this
conduct,” the department said. The department said it will send officials to the school to
offer counselling to learners who may have been traumatised by this act. Given the nature of this incident, the school has been
directed to open a case with the police. According to the Department it will monitor the developments
at this school very closely. The department further said this was an isolated incident
and it may not be tolerated regardless of the circumstances. “The Department urges teachers and stakeholders to uphold
the honour and dignity of the teaching profession and expose any behaviour that
seeks to undermine this virtue.”
