BOBBY loved her owner and they were very close. But tragedy struck when owner Chadwick “Khehla” Nhlabathi (51) was one of the people killed by the Basotho gang in Angelo Squatter Camp, Ekurhuleni, last Saturday. Bobby was left all alone and since then, she has visited the spot where her owner died every day. She sniffs Chadwick’s blood before going back to her kennel and mourning for him. Chadwick’s neighbour Valerie Manyala said: “We wish we could do something to take away her pain but have no idea how to help her.” Neighbour Nomthandazo Mbutho said Chadwick’s family covered the blood where he died but this made Bobby unhappy. “She’s been aggressive and she’s angry because she feels something has been removed from her,” she said. Neighbours have started looking after Bobby, making sure she has food and water. Fanuel Mhlungu, another neighbour, said: “Khehla was a good neighbour. He loved his dog and it was the only friend he had. He didn’t have family.” Neighbours said Khehla even shared his food with Bobby. “He used to take her for vaccinations and you can see she’s a healthy dog,” said another resident, Johannes Mtshwene. “Visiting the spot where her owner died is one way of mourning him.” Jerry Selloane of the Soweto Animal Rescue and Advisory Centre said what Bobby was doing was not unusual. “Sniffing the blood is one way of showing her love and bidding her owner farewell,” he said.
