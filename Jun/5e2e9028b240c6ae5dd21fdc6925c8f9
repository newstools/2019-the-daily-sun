THE family of murdered teacher Sibonakaliso Nyawose has distanced itself from allegations that he may have been murdered because of a vacant post for a principal. In a WhatsApp video, Sadtu KZN provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza allegedly implicated the school’s acting principal, Themba Shezi, in Nyawose’s murder. She allegedly said Shezi was seen around the school with unknown people and that he and Nyawose were the only applicants for the post. But Nyawose’s brother, Kwenza Magwaza (44), said the family will not point fingers at anyone. He said people should leave the investigation to the police. Shezi visited the family and said Nyawose was his best friend and a good colleague. Daily Sun ran a story on Wednesday in which Shezi said he would take Caluza to court for defaming him. He said he wanted R3 million to clear his name. Sadtu national secretary Mugwena Maluleke said they were still consulting a lawyer regarding Shezi’s demand. Nyawose was buried on Monday. A gunman killed him last week inside Masuku Primary School premises at Folweni, south of Durban.
