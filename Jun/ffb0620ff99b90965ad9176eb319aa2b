An 18-year-old is being investigated after he allegedly
mowed down nine pupils while rushing to school in his father's car to write an
exam. According to Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe
Ngoepe, the teen lost control of the vehicle and knocked down nine fellow
pupils in Motupa village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, on Wednesday morning. "They were taken to the hospital for medical treatment,
but one of them was certified dead on arrival," Ngoepe said in a
statement. The deceased was identified as 18-year-old Koketjo Brian
Raholane. The Citizen reported that exams were suspended at Mohlatlego
Machaba High School on Thursday following the incident. School principal Emanuel Motshinye reportedly said that the
suspect was rushing to school to write a Sepedi paper when the incident
happened. "The children were sitting under the tree adjacent to
the school fence," he said. "But suddenly, a speeding vehicle came,
at once killing one of them," Motshinye told The Citizen. Most of the injured pupils are in Grade 8. Police investigations were still continuing, Ngoepe told
