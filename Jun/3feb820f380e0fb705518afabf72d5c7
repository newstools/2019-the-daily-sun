THE battle for the available two spots in the National First Davison (NFD) next season, has reached the business end with four teams left in the ABC Motsepe League playoffs. The competition kicked off on Wednesday at Erica Park in Cape Town with nine teams eying the whopping R1 million up for grabs and of course, a place in the second division of Mzansi football. The teams whose dream of playing in the NFD next season is close to being a reality, are Casric from North West, Steenberg from the Mother City, Hungry Lions from the Northern Cape and JDR Stars from Gauteng. The semi-finals will take place today with the final, which was initially scheduled for Sunday, now set to take place tomorrow at Athlone Stadium (3pm). The battle for playoffs, however, has not been without controversy and has, in fact, been marred by allegations of match-fixing with cases reported in no less than four provinces. On the eve of the playoffs, Gauteng region winner Dondol were kicked out, following a Safa arbitration ruling which found them guilty of corruption. That meant their place would be taken by JDR Stars who finished second in the league.JDR’s CEO Tumi Kganaga said they always anticipated that the Safa arbitration would rule in their favour, hence they made the trip to Cape Town a week before the playoffs. “The controversy with the cases was not ideal because the uncertainty played a lot on the minds of the players leading to the players,” said Kganyago. “We lost the first match against Steenberg partly due to what the players had to go through in the lead up to the game.“But we are pleased to have bounced back and booked our spot in the semi-finals, hopefully we can go on to the final. “We will respect whoever we come up against because all the teams have potential to win this competition. We just want to see this team in the NFD next season so we will be doing everything we can to make that happen.”
