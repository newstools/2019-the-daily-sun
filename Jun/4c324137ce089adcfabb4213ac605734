THE late HHP’s will apparently leaves out his customary wife Lerato Sengadi. This is according to a report in The Citizen quoting Sunday World. On Saturday night at the SA Music Awards, HHP’s only child, 14 year-old Leano, accepted the Lifetime Achievement award on behalf of his father whose suicide death shocked Mzansi. Lerato Sengadi was also in attendance at the SAMAs and was expected to accept the award on behalf of her late husband, whose real name was Jabulani Tsambo. According to the publication Leano now stands to inherit everything, though the courts may still have the final say in the matter. Leano’s mother Lerato Khanye died from an illness just over a month after HHP. HHP committed suicide last year at home after a long struggle with depression. Sengadi apparently declined to comment while the Tsambo family apparently confirmed the contents of the will. Last year on November 1 a day before HHP's funeral, the South Gauteng High Court ruled that by law Sengadi was his customary wife but denied her interdict to stop his funeral in Mahikeng. She attended the funeral accompanied by her mom. According to the report, the Tsambo family was granted leave to appeal the ruling earlier this year affirming her as HHP’s customary wife. If she ends up winning the case, she will be entitled to half of the deceased estate even though she was excluded from the will. If she loses, Leano is likely to get everything.
