Fifteen people have been hospitalised for mild smoke
inhalation, whilst some had sustained burn wounds following a fire at the South
African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) offices in Auckland Park, Johannesburg
on Tuesday. This is according to emergency responders quoted by  news site IOL. "Fifteen people have been hospitalised following a fire
at a business at Auckland Park, Johannesburg," ER24 spokesperson Russel
Meiring said. "Fifteen people have been hospitalised following a fire at a
business at Auckland Park, Johannesburg," ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring
told IOL. Meiring said details surrounding the incident are not yet
known.  Authorities were on the scene to
conduct further investigations. News24 reported that the fire prompted immediate changes to
the production of the SABC's radio stations and their programming. This was the second mass evacuation at the South African
public broadcaster within two months. The fire broke out inside the cafeteria located close to the
studios of the 5FM and Metro FM radio stations. The fire – apparently electrical – was extinguished,
although the cause has not yet been confirmed. Similar to last month, the evacuation prompted immediate
changes to the production of the SABC's radio stations and their programming,
including the Afrikaans station RSG that switched to producing from its Cape
Town studio in Sea Point. There's not been a statement from the SABC yet. The same Radio Park building was evacuated last month during
a diesel spill that saw thousands of litres of diesel flood the building when a
power outage caused the building to switch to its back-up power generator
located on the 15th floor. "A failure of the equipment led to the diesel tank
overflowing," the SABC said last month. SABC executives, as well as former and current SABC board
members, have been warning for months that the SABC has failed to do
maintenance due to the broadcaster's precarious financial position.
