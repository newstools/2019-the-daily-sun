“The city committed a crime on Friday when it demolished your houses.” These were the words of City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba on Monday. Mashaba was addressing the displaced Alexandra residents whose houses were demolished on Friday. He said that two wrongs cannot make a right. “Yes, you built here illegally, but you did so because the government failed to provide you with housing,” Mashaba said Mashaba said that he is making a commitment that they will be rebuilding the people’s houses within the next four weeks.  Mashaba said that he will get officials to as soon as Tuesday go to Alexandra and asses the structures that were demolished and look at how much money they will need to assist the community. Mashaba said the MMC for Housing must make a plan. “The question of where they will find the money is not your problem. They must make a plan,” Mashaba said.  Mashaba said that he will also work with Eskom to ensure that the community get electricity as soon as possible. “If Eskom doesn't allow us to give you electricity. We will pay for it. They must provide it. Please bear with us. Make sure that people with evil spirits don't hijack the process. We want that within the four weeks we start building.”
