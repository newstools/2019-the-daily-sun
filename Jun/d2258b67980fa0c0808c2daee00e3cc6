 Six members of the Anti-Gang Unit were shot and injured as
they were tracing suspects in Samora Machel, Nyanga Cape Town. The incident reportedly happened in the early hours Wednesday
morning. “The members who were on a tracing operation in Sweet Home
Farm informal settlement had just apprehended one suspect allegedly linked to
recent murders in Samora Machel. “As the members were searching for another suspect also
sought for serious crime in the area, shots came from one of the shacks,”
Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa. Potelwa said two cops suffered serious injury and four
others were also wounded. “They have all been admitted to hospital. The area is
difficult to access with a terrain that is poorly lit and shacks erected close
to each other. “Unfortunately, the area is also a hide-out for dangerous
criminals. Recently a spate of murders took place in the area,” Potelwa added. Trauma counselling is currently offered to AGU members and
police have launched a manhunt for the suspects.
