A group of twenty six players have gathered in Pretoria on Sunday for the next installment of the national alignment and conditioning camps as the Springboks continue with their preparations for the forthcoming international season. Players from the Bulls and the Sharks who took part in the weekend’s Super Rugby quarter-final matches, will join the camp from next Monday. The Springboks kick off their shortened campaign on 20 July against Australia in Johannesburg and that match will be followed a week later by the keenly awaited rematch with New Zealand in Wellington, the scene of last year’s epic away win over against the All Blacks. The Boks conclude their official campaign against Argentina two weeks later, on 10 August in Salta, while the same two teams are set to meet again a week later in Pretoria in a once-off Test before the Boks report for Rugby World Cup training duty.
