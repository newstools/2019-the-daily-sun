NONKULULEKO believes that if life gives you lemons, it’s up to you to make lemonade. Nonkululeko Gcwensa, from KwaNdaba Village in Maphumulo, northern KZN, makes a living from her tuckshop in D Section, KwaMashu. The 30-year-old who uses crutches to walk told Daily Sun she was involved in a car accident in 2006. “I tried getting a disability grant but for some reason, my application was unsuccessful. “I also received a small payout from the Road Accident Fund which didn’t last long. “I did a fashion design course but that didn’t lead to any work, so I realised I needed to make a solid plan to earn a living.” She now sells vetkoek, fried chips, bread and cold drinks at her shop. “I’m not making a lot of money but have stopped relying on my parents for my basic needs. I look after myself,” she said. Nonkululeko said getting to the wholesalers to buy stock was difficult. “It’s hard using public transport when you’re carrying plastic bags and you’re on crutches. When I get in and out of a taxi, I’m expected to quickly move my plastic bags by myself and feel pressurised.” She said while she was focusing on growing her business, she would love it if government would provide her with a house that catered for her needs.
