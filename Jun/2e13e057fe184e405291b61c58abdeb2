CASTER Semenya has won a  major victory against last month’s IAAF ruling which threatened to stop her from competing with other women on the tracks. According to EWN,the Olympic gold winner’s lawyers have announced that the Swiss Federal Supreme Court has suspended the implementation of the IAAF’s regulations for athletes with “differences of sex development” with regards to the runner. The suspension is valid until Semenya's appeal against the rules has been finalised. Semenya’s lawyer spoke to 702 on Monday afternoon. This means Semenya will be able to run any race she would have usually run without taking medication to lower her testosterone levels. Last month the Court of Arbitration for Sport  denied Caster’s appeallast month over measures imposed by the IAAF that compel "hyperandrogenic" athletes to lower their testosterone levels if they wish to compete as women. The IAAF has until 25 June to respond to the application.
