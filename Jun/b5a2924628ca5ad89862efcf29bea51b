A DAD wants justice after his son was attacked at school, allegedly by more than 10 pupils. According to Papi Thebe (44) of Ottoshoop, North West, his son Letlhogonolo (19) was stabbed on the ear, left arm and cut twice in the back with scissors on 23 May. “They attacked him with stones after he fell down. He was saved by his friends,’’ he said. Papi said the principal of Onkgopotse Tiro Comprehensive School refused to speak to him. Apparently, his son was taken to hospital by a teacher. Papi called the premier’s office and a woman named Julia said she would come back to him but never did. He called the district education manager Basie Mabati, who also didn’t get back to him. Papi reported the matter to cops. Letlhogonolo said pupils received a WhatsApp message that read, “Someone is going to die”, the night before he was attacked. Colonel Adele Myburgh said one suspect (20) was arrested on 24 May. “The suspect appeared in the Mmabatho Magistrates Court on 27 May and on 6 June. “He was released on warning. The case is under investigation.” Education spokesman Elias Malindi said disciplinary hearings were under way. “The matter was referred to the Ottoshoop police, who arrested the alleged attacker,” he said.
