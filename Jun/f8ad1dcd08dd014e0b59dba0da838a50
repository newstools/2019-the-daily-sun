CELEBRATING Youth Month isn’t enough. uMhlathuze mayor Mduduzi Mhlongo said these days, the youth needs to improve their lives so they can support themselves and their families. He was speaking during the Youth Month celebration at Mzuvukile Sports Ground in Nseleni, KZN on Saturday, where the small businesses of 10 young people were boosted. They received donations including grass cutting and sewing machines and R50 000 cash from the National Youth Development Agency and uMhlathuze Municipality. Ntando Nxumalo (23) said she was grateful for a new sewing machine. “Last year I decided to start sewing clothes for my neighbours. Now that I have a good working machine, I will be able to grow my business.” Mhlongo said: “The municipality realised it wouldn’t be enough just to enjoy Youth Month. We also thought of improving the lives of our youth.” He said they wanted young people to grow their businesses and avoid crime. The agency’s Sandile Dlamuka said: “Today we are here with youths whose businesses we funded. We are pleased to have made a difference to their lives.”
