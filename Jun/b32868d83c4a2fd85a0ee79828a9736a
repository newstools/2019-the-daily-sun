TSHEPO Moloi (26) makes sure that other blind people receive the best help to get around town. Tshepo from Rotanda in Heidelberg, Gauteng, simply asks blind people if they need help. “If they accept I walk with them and let them hold my elbow or just touch my arm,” said Tshepo. Tshepo is partially blind. “Sometimes I go with them wherever they go. Some even send me to the shops or go with me because I’m their guide.” The young man has been partially blind since he was seven years old. “I used to wear glasses and I could only play for 20 or 30 minutes a day because of the strain in my eyes. At night I couldn’t play at all because I couldn’t see in the dark.” He said he enjoyed playing soccer and he was a striker whose silk moves made it easier for his teammates to score. “My nickname was mashortana but I don’t have a problem with that because I’m short,” said Tshepo. He is in grade 12 at City Deep Adult Centre in Joburg.. Tshepo said he would like to study languages at Wits University next year so he can be a court interpreter one day. “I learned all official languages at Olympia Park Special School in Springs, Ekurhuleni.” He said he hates it when people assume that blind people are unable to do anything for themselves.
