OVER the years, Soweto-on-Sea kasi in Port Elizabeth has turned into a den of criminals. Commuters told Daily Sun taxis and buses were too scared to take them home because of the situation. Sindiswa Jongman (34) told Daily Sun: “Bus and jikeleza drivers are scared of Bafana Street in the kasi. Drivers from Motherwell tell you they can’t take you. “They drop us in Zwide, which is far from our houses. We then become easy targets for criminals. “Bus drivers are also afraid to come to Taxi Square because thugs get on the buses and rob people.” Jikeleza driver Sindile Katu (29) said: “Driving on Bafana Street after 6pm is risky. Armed thugs pretend to be passengers and rob us. Commuters fight with us when we refuse to drop them there.” Another driver said he was robbed by a fake passenger last month. “He pointed a firearm at me and forced me to give him all the money I worked for,” he said. Councillor Zoliswa Dlula said: “Nurses at the clinic get intimidated by thugs with guns who demand they get served first. “When I escort municipal workers to fix drains, criminals insult me and call me rubbishkazi.” Captain Andre Beetge said: “We attend to areas where crime regularly takes place. “We also work with CPFs.”
