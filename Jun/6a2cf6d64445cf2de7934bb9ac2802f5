RESIDENTS put their protest on hold on Wednesday after being promised RDP houses. The violent protest for service delivery took place on Tuesday   at Emaphephethweni in Inanda, north of Durban. But the next day all roads which were closed were opened and teaching and learning started again in all the schools in the area. Inkosi Thandizwe Gwala managed to calm the residents. He told them he and the councillor had agreed they would soon build 40 RDP houses for residents. Resident Sifiso Ntombela (32) said the protest was only put on hold to give them time to fulfil their promise. “We will give it some time to see if the project is launched. We also want to see how many houses will be built. “That will determine whether we resume our protest or not. “We also want to see if water trucks will come as our taps have been dry for many years,” said Sifiso. Another resident, Nonjabulo Mtshali (35), said they didn’t want to be neglected because they had also voted. “We voted for a better life. “Since politicians only understand the language of burning tyres, we were left with no choice but to speak the language they understand. “We hope the promise of 40 houses is not a false one,” said Nonjabulo. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said police were still monitoring the situation. “No arrests have been made,” said Gwala.
