actually have hope in a brighter future. Everything has to start somewhere and

sex and substance abuse that the youth are faced with shouldn`t be the government’s

need to play a role in ensuring that South Africa has a vibrant, skillful and
goal-oriented society for the generation to come. STF winter challenge sports
