ORLANDO Pirates long-serving captain Happy Jele has penned a new contract until the end of the upcoming 2019/20 campaign. Jele enjoyed a solid season in the past 2018/19 campaign as he converted successfully to a central defender from a right-back under coach Milutin Sredojevic. The 32-year-old has been with Pirates since 2006 and is the longest-serving active member of the squad. The player has signed a one-year contract extension with an option for a further year thereafter. The club's official website said: "Orlando Pirates Football Club can confirm that captain Happy Jele's services will be retained for a further season. "The deal was concluded after a brief meeting between the Chairman and the player's manager Jazzman Mahlakgane at the Houghton office on Monday. "Jele, who will celebrate his 13th year as an Orlando Pirates player this upcoming season, has been handed a one-year extension with an additional option to keep him at the Club up to the end of the 2021/22 season."
