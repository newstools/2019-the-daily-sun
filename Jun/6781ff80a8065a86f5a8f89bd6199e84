ALMOST two years ago, a desperate mum chained her son to a gas cylinder to stop him taking drugs. The son also wanted to be clean but she wasn’t taking any chances. Today, Nolufefe Jojo (43) from Marikana squatter camp in Cape Town is happy her son Buchule (17) hasn’t used drugs since then. “He started taking drugs when he was 15. I got help through Daily Sun in 2017 and he went to a rehabilitation centre,” she said. Buchule completed his stay in rehab and was sent home but he then asked to be transferred to a rehab in George. “I was happy to hear him taking the decision on his own,” Nolufefe said. “He stayed there for 2018 and studied hospitality.” Daily Sun first published Buchule’s story in October 2017 and followed up with the second story on 11 July last year. “If it weren’t for the paper, my son would have been dead,” Nolufefe said. “I will never use drugs again,” he said, thanking the People’s Paper. He also thanked his mum for chaining him. “It was for my own good. I also wanted to stop using drugs. I didn’t have a problem being chained to the cylinder.” He said he has a certificate in hospitality and needs a job or a soccer team because that’s his great love. Buchule is now warning Marikana kids about the danger of drugs. “You hurt your family and yourself when you use drugs,” he said. Malusi Sindaphi (14) said they need more people like Buchule. “There are a lot of drugs and they’re easy to get hold of,” he said. Luniko Gawushe (13) said: “We never thought he’d quit drugs. He’s helping many young people and motivating others who want to quit.”
