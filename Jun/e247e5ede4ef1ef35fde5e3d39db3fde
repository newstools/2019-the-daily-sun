SAMGOMAS said they should be taken as seriously as medical doctors. Speaking from his office at Phomolong Station in Orlando West, Soweto, sangoma Mtimande Ngwenya of Ubuhle BeNgcugce Projects told Daily Sun sangomas can give patients sick notes. But he said it was sad to see some employers didn’t recognise them. Mtimande encouraged all healers to register with the SA Traditional Healers Practitioners Council to be recognised. He said they were working with the CRL Rights Commission to make sure healers don’t abuse patients. “When we find those who do, we close them down.” He said they were also hoping to get permission to issue notices of death. “A doctor fills in the form and hands it over but when a patient dies at the healer’s place, cops are called. Claims of the healer killing the patient follow, even if it was too late for muthi.” Mtimande said helping people was a calling. “The problem we face today is people pretend to be called to heal, only to fool people and make money.” SunLander Ndabezitha Mbatha (30) said he didn’t go to doctors. “But I used to have problems when I was sick and gave a note from a traditional healer.” Mdu Dlamini said: “I didn’t know a sangoma could also give sick notes.” CRL Commission spokesman Mpiyakhe Mkholo said only registered practitioners could issue sick notes.
