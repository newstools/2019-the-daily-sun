WHILE some kids are on holiday, others are studying hard and already preparing for their final matric exam. Grade 12 pupils from various schools in Tshwane are taking part in the Secondary School Improvement Programme. The programme is the department’s plan to support pupils by offering free tuition classes. The classes are taught by expert tutors on Saturdays and during school holidays. MEC for Education in Gauteng Panyaza Lesufi visited the Tshwane University of Technology to meet pupils attending programme. Lesufi was there on Wednesday to monitor the rollout of the programme and encourage pupils to prepare early for their finals. He also encouraged teachers who were taking part. Lesufi urged the pupils to be innovative and use technology. He told the pupils at the camp they could be the best in the world. “We want you to think out of the box, to design highways and gadgets for the future. We brought you here because you have the brains. Please use them,” he said. He said the pupils should forget about the challenges they faced and dream big. He said they must make sure their matric certificates showed great marks. “For that document to reflect well on you, you need to work hard,” he said. He said the province was spending almost R240 million to make sure pupils were prepared for their final exams.
