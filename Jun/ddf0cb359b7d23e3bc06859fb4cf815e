GOGO Khokhi Nxumalo is living in fear. She’s convinced the unstable mud house which she shares with her family will collapse on them. Khokhi (89) lives with five grandkids and two great-grandkids at Bhukhanana Village in Empangeni, northern KZN. She said life had become a daily struggle. She doesn’t see herself being able to build a proper house for her family. “I receive pension money, and my great-grandkids get child support grants. “The money only covers groceries, clothes and basic needs. “After a few days the money is used up and we’re left with nothing.” She said weather conditions are harsh, irrespective of the season. “In winter it’s cold inside. On rainy days in summer, we huddle in one corner of the house as the roof leaks.” She does not recall telling the ward councillor about her plight. “I don’t attend community meetings. I think that’s why the councillor hasn’t reached out. I’m old, so I might not have told him about my situation.” Councillor Zakhele Xulu wasn’t aware of her plight but keen to meet her. Spokesman for the uMhlathuze municipality, Mdu Ncalane, said: “Kindly give us details so we can do our own assessment through our structures, confirm the situation, and see what assistance we can provide. Thereafter, we can comment formally.”
