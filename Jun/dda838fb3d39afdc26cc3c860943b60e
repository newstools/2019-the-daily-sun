TEACHERS and pupils are being terrorised by snakes in their classroom. Pupils are expected to go to school, but asking them to share their space with snakes is asking too much. Teachers from Masakhane Tswelopele Primary School in Roodepoort, Gauteng, have asked the department of education to intervene. Teachers told Daily Sun the snakes had appeared on four different occasions and on Wednesday 5 June, another one arrived. “And just when we think they are gone, they pitch up again!” said a teacher. “Three months don’t go by without us finding snakes in class. Then we have to take them outside and kill them to avoid traumatising pupils.” Teachers said they have done everything in their power to have the snakes removed. “We have prayed, we have brought parents in to come up with solutions. We don’t know what else to do,” she said. Some parents suggested the school plants flowers that chase away evil spirits and snakes but it didn’t work. “We ended up removing the flowers because they’re clearly not working.” Nomsa Masondo (33) is a parent who suggested planting the flowers. “The flowers didn’t work so we took them out,” she said. “I’m just trying to make sure my baby is safe.” Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said they didn’t know about the problem. “Now that we do, we will assist the school as soon as possible,” he said.
