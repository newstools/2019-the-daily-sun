TAVERN owner Thys Mabaso (67) from Bothaville in the Free State claims his business is targeted by nyaope addicts who break in but only steal R2 coins. Thys woke up on Sunday to find the R2 coins from his pool table and jukebox gone. The thugs left behind about R800 that was plainly visible. They waited until all the guests left and got in through the ceiling. They broke the pool table with a wheel spanner to steal the coins. “This is the fourth time this year we’ve been broken into, only to discover coins missing.” Thys said: “Nyaope addicts left everything else in its place, including the notes I left on top of the cash register. “On Sunday, I went to clean in the morning and saw someone had got in through the ceiling. “This surprised me because nothing else was taken. The suspects are addicts who like walking with coins in their pockets because of the sound it makes. “There was about R80 worth of coins in the pool table. I believe the thugs don’t know the value of money and that is why they only take coins. “I am planning to sleep inside my tavern so I can protect my property myself because security gates are no match for addicts.” Captain Stephen Thakeng said: “We are investigating. No suspects have been bust yet”.
