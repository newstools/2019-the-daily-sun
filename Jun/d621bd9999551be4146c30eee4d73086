Free State DA leader Patricia Kopane conveyed her condolences to the Deniacos family. “Councillor Monica always served the community of Tokologo (Dealesville, Boshof and Hertzogville) to the best of her abilities and was a much-loved public representative as its sole representative on Tokologo Council since 2016,”“Monica was also a prominent businesswoman in Dealsville for many years,” said Kopane.
