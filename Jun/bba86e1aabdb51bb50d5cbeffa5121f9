THREE matches, eight goals conceded and one scored! That is the sad story of Banyana Banyana after their maiden Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. Much as this might sound extremely bad and discouraging, but things could have been worse for Desiree Ellis’ charges. They held their own and fought like lionesses of South Africa, until their last loss to Germany when they were hammered 4-0 by tournament favourites. One could easily be forgiven for criticising and lambasting the team for having gone to Paris to make up the numbers. But in reality, as the saying goes, experience is the best teacher and they will go to the 2023 edition of the championship a lot better prepared. We say Safa officials must support Ellis and the women during this time of need. To add on top of the lessons in France, Safa must speed up plans to professionalise women’s football with the involvement of the PSL and its clubs. Calls have been made in the past decade for women’s football to be professionalised, and Safa president Danny Jordaan is on record as saying that this will happen in August. Ellis has done a superb job in assembling a quality team made up of locally based players, as well as those playing professionally in Europe and the USA. As South Africans, we must welcome back Banyana with open arms when they land at OR Tambo this morning (11am). We must also show the team that we appreciate them. There is no doubt that we might surprise many in 2023 when the spectacle is held, either in Mzansi or wherever it may be hosted.
