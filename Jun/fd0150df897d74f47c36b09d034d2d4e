YOLISWA Gebani was shattered when her son was killed in a gruesome accident by City of Tshwane construction workers. And now she might become homeless. Yoliswa (38) from Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, said her 19-month-old son was hit on the head by a construction earth mover while playing in the yard in 2011. Municipal workers were building an RDP next to her yard. “Although I wanted the construction workers to pay for what they did, I knew it wouldn’t bring my son back,” she said. So instead of laying criminal charges or demanding compensation from the municipality, Yoliswa asked for a permanent place to stay as the stand she lived on wasn’t hers. She was told the stand belonged to no one and she’d be given papers so it could be hers. “I was happy to finally have a place of my own,” she said. But her joy was short-lived. Her neighbour told her last month she had to leave as he had sold the stand to a pastor who wanted to build a church. “He told me I had until the end of July to move out. I explained to him the city gave me this place, but he refused to listen. Instead he offered me R30 000 to move out,” she said. “I can’t move out. When my child died I planted a tree in his memory. When I miss him I go to the tree to find peace.” Human settlements and housing MMC Mandla Nkomo said: “I’ve told my team to look at how we can assist. Unfortunately, the processes take long. My team and I will do a follow-up.”
