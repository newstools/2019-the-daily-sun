Speaking to Daily Sun, Mdu said he’s been singing since he was young. “I told myself that if I took action, something would happen,” he said. “I decided to camp outside Afrotainment with my guitar and sang. I only did it for a few days. “I know I’m talented but I didn’t know if Tira would like my work. “I couldn’t believe it when he invited me into the studio and, as they say, the rest is history.” Mdu believes what’s happening in his life is the will of God. “You know when you believe in His mercy, things happen. “Talent alone without faith is nothing.” Mdu recently dropped his debut single titled Malokazi. The song is available on all digital platforms. His dream is to do exactly like Tira, to help other people fulfill their dreams. “I draw the inspiration from Zahara. I believe she is a talented musician, who touches people’s hearts when she sings,” said Ncube. DJ Tira said he found it hard to ignore the talent he heard. “When I heard him sing, I felt something in my heart. “I think he’s a good example to other youth who have dreams. I respect Mduduzi. He is passionate and driven.”
