IT is that time of the year again where hordes of South African ultra distance runners will converge in KwaZulu Natal for another thrilling day of Comrades Marathon. The gruelling 87km up-run distance is what makes it interesting and fun for the 25 000 who will be winning to spend about 12 hours on the road to complete the full distance of the marathon. But there are those spend about five hours to win the race and claim the R500 000 winners’ prize money. And top of the men’s favourites is three times Comrades champion Bongmusa Mthembu, David Gatebe, Marko Mambo, Mike Fokoroni and Gift Kelehe who will surely feature in the leaders group when the race starts. Do not rule out former winner, Ludwick Mamabolo, who will be back after his race was last year hampered by injury. The 25 000 runners, who have used different qualifier races across the world to enter Comrades, will converge at Durban’s City Hall on Sunday a 5.30am and finish at the Scottville Racecourse in Pietermaritzburg. Runners will go through the Top of Fields Hill, Drummond where there is the 11 hours cut off and through the Polly Shorts mountain before finishing the race. Whether Mthembu will pocket his fourth win will remain on the chain of credible runners who will be looking at denying him the honours of rewriting the marathon’s history. There is his Nedbank Running Club team mate, Edward Mothibi, who will be looking to come out on tops having finished fourth on debut last year. The tiny athlete, who is known as “slender”, definitely packs a punch and has trained specifically for the Sunday’s classic. “I can say my training has gone extremely well and I am more than ready for the race,” Mothibi told his club from his training camp in Rustenburg. “I have put all my eggs in one basket for Comrades, even jogging Two Oceans as a training run where in the past I used to race it.” Claude Moshiywa said:“The only thing standing on Mthembu’s way is Mthembu. Only a minor mistake can stop him from achieving his dream.” Also on the hunt is up-run specialist Hatiwande Nyamande who finished third and second respectively in the past races. He will now be hoping for third time lucky. In the women’s race, it remains a big poser whether Caroline Wostmann will be back to do what she did it in 2015 when she won the Two Oceans and the Comrades in the same year. United States’ favourite girl, Camille Herron, has confirmed her entry, as well as Charne Bosman, Gerda Steyn and Ann Ashworth who will be lining up against top Zimbabwean runners. Steyn is as cool as a cucumber about her chances: “A double is doable. I just need to maintain a cool head.” PREVIOUS 10 WINNERS MEN: 2018: Bongmusa Mthembu (SA, 5:26:34) – down-run 2017: Bongmusa Mthembu (SA, 5:35:34) – up-run 2016: David Gatebe (SA, 5:18:19) – down-run 2015: Gift Kelehe (SA, 5:38:36) – up-run 2014: Bongmusa Mthembu (SA, 5:28:34) – down-run 2013: Claude Moshyiwa (SA, 5:32:09) – up-run 2012: Ludwick Mamabolo (SA, 5:31:03) – down-run 2011: Stephen Muzhingi (Zimbabwe, 5:32:45) – up-run 2010: Stephen Muzhingi (Zimbabwe, 5:29:01) – down-run 2009: Stephen Muzhingi (Zimbabwe, 5:23:27) – up-run WOMEN 2018: Ann Ashworth (SA, 6:10:04) – down-run 2017: Camille Herron (US, 6:27:35) – up-run 2016: Charne Bosman (SA, 6:25:55) – down-run 2015: Caroline Wostmann (SA, 6:12:22) – up-run 2014: Eleanor Greenwood (UK, 6:18:15) – down-run 2013: Elena Nurgalieva (Russia, 6:27:09) – up-run 2012: Elena Nurgalieva (Russia, 6:07:12) – down-run 2011: Elena Nurgalieva (Russia, 6:24:11) –up-run 2010: Elena Nurgalieva (Russia, 6:13:03) – down-run 2009: Olesya Nurgalieva (Russia, 6:12:08) – down-run
