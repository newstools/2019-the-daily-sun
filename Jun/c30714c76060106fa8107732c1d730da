PEOPLE are living in fear of escalating violence after a fight in a tavern led to the death of a 20-year-old man. Resident Sifiso Lukhele (34) from Enseleni kasi outside Richards Bay, in northern KZN, said: “The young man was killed last week and two others were injured. They were boozing when suddenly they started fighting and hacking one another.” It isn’t clear what started the fight but it is suspected it is related to faction fighting. Sifiso said following the incident, young men in the area go around carrying pangas. Another resident, Sizakele Mbatha (28), said they suspect the men carrying pangas want revenge which may lead to more bloodshed. Councillor Dumisani Ndimande said they are worried about the violence because they worked hard to end the political violence. “In 2014 there was a similar problem and it was ended in 2015 after the traditional leaders intervened. “We will try to talk to the elders to solve this before more lives are lost,” he said. Mduduzi Mhlongo, the uMhlathuze mayor, condemned the attacks and urged the youth to stop fighting. “We’re also calling on cops to make a quick arrest so the culprits will be removed from the area.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a murder case is being investigated by the Empangeni cops.
