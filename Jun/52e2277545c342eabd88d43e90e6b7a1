A woman who allegedly stole more than N35 million (R1,4 million), and claimed a snake had swallowed the money, has pleaded not guilty. Philomina Chieshe is among three suspects who face corruption charges for allegedly defrauding her employer, the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, between 2009 and 2016. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has brought them before the Federal Capital Territory in the capital city Abuja. Chieshe, Yakubu Jekada and Samuel Sale Umoru were bust following an audit report indicting them over the alleged theft of money that was proceeds from the sale of the board’s examination cards. The former employees face charges bordering on fraud, misappropriation of funds and criminal breach of trust. They jointly face the charges but Chieshe has been slapped with an extra one as she allegedly kept the funds. According to the charge sheet, she claimed the money “disappeared as a result of manipulations from the kingdom of darkness”. – CAJ NEWS
