ANY man can get a woman pregnant, but being a father means being present in a child’s life. Not having a dad around inspired Bongani Luvalo (31) to be the best father possible. He told Daily Sun he wanted to inspire other fathers and started the Cool Dads Foundation in 2012. The non-profit organisation was based in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni. It was made up of 2 800 fathers who were taught how to interact with their kids and how to get access to them if they were not with their baby mamas anymore. The foundation also sometimes organised outings for fathers and their children. On top of this, 50 boys were enrolled in the foundation’s big brother mentorship programme, which taught them life skills so they could be the fathers of tomorrow. Bongani, who has a five-year-old daughter, said: “We’re close and it’s always been that way. I’m involved in her life and I want her to become the best she can be. “The foundation wants to change the idea that fathers who’re unable to contribute financially are useless.”
