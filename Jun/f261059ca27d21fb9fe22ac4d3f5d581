ZAMBIA's COSAFA Cup triumphed will go along way in consoling the country after failing to qualify for this year's AFCON, according to their caretaker coach Aggrey Chiyangi. Forest Rangers striker Austin Muwowo scored the all important goal for the Chipolopolo when they defeated Botswana 1-0 in the final of the regional tournament at Durban's Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. It was Zambia third time lucky after losing the last two finals at the hands of Zimbabwe. This means their COSAFA Cup trophy tally is now fifth, one ahead of Zimbabwe who are on sixth, one ahead of South Africa who have won it four times. "This is great achievement in my career and I hope this victory will console our supporters back home after we couldn't qualify for the AFCON,'' said Chiyangi. "So this is consolation and a sign that there's future in our football in Zambia." Zambia, who stunned Ivory Coast to win the 2012 AFCON trophy in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, came so close to book their spot for 2019 AFCON. They were unfortunately pipped in the race in the last group matches despite thrashing Namibia 4-1 at home in Lusaka. It wasn't as other results didn't go their way, with Guinea Bissau getting a 2-2 draw against Mozambique. Zambia finished in Group K with seven points, one behind Namibia who finished second, two behind Guinea Bissau. It is the second time that they will miss this biennial tournament having also failed in 2017. Just like winning the COSAFA Cup in their third attempt, they'll hope for the third time lucky also in the AFCON 2021 in their bid to qualify which will be staged in Cameroon. "There's future in Zambian football and we still got the very strong under-23 team and I believe we can build we can qualify for the next AFCON. I can assure you for the next AFCON we'll make sure that we do qualify because we got players who can do the job,"Chiyangi added.
