Seasoned Journalist Redi Tlhabi is not a fan of Pearl Thusi’s interviewing skills! Following Pearls’ interview with AKA on Behind the story, Redi did not shy away from expressing the negative gender stereotypes that she felt were being perpetuated on the show. Redi joined in on the conversation about how Pearl Thusi handled the AKA interview. “… And the interviewer was enjoying it. You CAN in an interview, interrupt & ask tough questions like “Wait, are you really going to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and should YOU not take responsibility for the choices you made?” No need to giggle your way around harmful answers,” she wrote. Most viewers felt Pearl was enjoying how the rapper trashed Bonang’s name. Black twitter called her out for having too much fun in trying to bring Bonang down during the interview.
