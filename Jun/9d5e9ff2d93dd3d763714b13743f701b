A PATIENT apparently committed suicide at Umphumulo Hospital on Thursday. KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu said the body of a 48-year-old man was found hanging from an extension cord tied to a water pipe in the bathroom of the hospital in Maphumulo, northern KZN. The MEC said a nurse had told the department they were suspicious about the whereabouts of the patient. “At 3.36pm a nurse noticed the sluice room door was locked and the patient wasn’t in bed. “After knocking and getting no response, the nurse was informed the patient had gone to the bathroom but didn’t return.” The MEC said the nurse called colleagues, who went to look for the patient. “When they saw the patient hanging, they forcibly opened the sluice room door. They immediately called the operational manager, who noticed the patient was still warm but not breathing,” said Simelane-Zulu. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “An inquest docket’s being investigated by Maphumulo cops after a 42-year-old man was found hanging on Thursday at a hospital.”
