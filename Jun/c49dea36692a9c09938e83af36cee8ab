HE had vision when he went to bed under a bridge, but the next morning he went blind. Instead of allowing the world to come crumbling down, Liko Manqumakazi accepted his fate. This opened Liko’s eyes, so to speak. Liko (32) from Mount Frere in the Eastern Cape lost his eyesight at a time when he’d often sleep under a bridge in Joburg. “My eyes started itching, and one night I went to sleep able to see. The next morning I was blind. “Doctors told me there was nothing they could do for me to get my sight back. “I cried a lot after being discharged. I had nowhere to go.” After telling doctors and a social worker about his situation, they sent him to the Joburg Society for the Blind. “As a resident there, I was encouraged to do a computer course. I’m now studying theology,” he said. He chose theology because of his trials and tribulations. Going blind took him off the streets. “When I had sight I lived a horrible life. “Now that I’ve been born again, I spend most of my time studying the Bible. I’m committed to God. He’s blessed me with a new life.”
