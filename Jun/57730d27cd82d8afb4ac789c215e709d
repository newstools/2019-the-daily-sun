MPUMALANGA co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC, Mandla Msibi, has warned communities to be vigilant against illegal initiation schools. Initiation season is getting under way in the province. Msibi said illegal initiation schools are a risk that contribute to deaths. He urged traditional leaders, community structures and parents to work together to prevent the mushrooming of illegal initiation schools in the province. “We appeal to parents to verify first whether the initiation schools in their area are legal before allowing their children to attend ingoma. “We are also urging traditional leaders to take a lead in the ingoma practice as custodians.” The Ingoma Act of 2011 regulates the practice of initiation schools. In terms of the Act, initiation schools are those that have been granted permission by traditional leaders in their area. “Working with the police, we will be merciless against those who operate illegal schools. “We will ensure that the owners are given harsh sentences as a deterrent against fatalities. “The department of health has assigned medical doctors and nurses to screen initiates before participating in the initiation process. “Law enforcement agencies are responsible for monitoring the legality of the initiation schools,” he said.
