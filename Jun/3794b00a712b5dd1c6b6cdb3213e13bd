JULIUS Malema was not at the Alexandra inquiry today. The EFF leader was expected to take the hot seat at the Human Rights Commission’s inquiry into conditions in the Joburg kasi to clarify his party’s stand on land occupation. EFF Gauteng chairwoman Mandisa Mashego appeared on his behalf to give submissions and answer questions. She was joined by party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Joburg chairman Musa Novela. The inquiry was established to investigate the quality of life of residents and the impact problems had on their human rights. It was established after residents shut down the kasi earlier this year. Mashego was questioned about residents’ claims that EFF members living in Alexandra were encouraging illegal land occupation. She said land occupation was an EFF programme and was part of the party’s founding manifesto. Things got heated when the commission’s Princess Ka-Siboto asked Mashego whether the EFF had considered the violence that came with evictions. Mashego said she was worried by Ka-Siboto’s question, especially coming from a person speaking for human rights. “It’s like asking me, if I’m raped what I did to avoid getting raped,” she said. “It is only an EFF conference that can make decisions to review positions. “The EFF’s founding manifesto cannot be changed. It’s like the Bible. It won’t be changed. There can be additions, but it will not change.”
