In the next 10 years, poverty will be a thing of the past in Mzansi. President Cyril Ramaphosa promised to tackle poverty during the State of the Nation address on Thursday in Cape Town. He said that no person in will go hungry in Mzansi in the next 10 years. “As Mzansi enters the next 25 years of democracy, and in pursuit of the objectives of the NDP, let us proclaim a bold and ambitious goal, a unifying purpose, to which we dedicate all our resources and energies. “As we enter the last decade of Vision 2030, let us even more clearly define the South Africa we want and agree on the concrete actions we need to achieve them. “To ensure that our efforts are directed, I am suggesting that, within the priorities of this administration, we agree on five fundamental goals for the next decade. Let us agree, as a nation and as a people united in our aspirations, that within the next 10 years we will have made progress in tackling poverty, inequality and unemployment, where:  - No person in South Africa will go hungry. - Our economy will grow at a much faster rate than our population. - Two million more young people will be in employment. - Our schools will have better educational outcomes and every 10 year old will be able to read for meaning. - Violent crime will be halved.  “Let us make these commitments now – to ourselves and to each other – knowing that they will stretch our resources and capabilities, but understanding that if we achieve these five goals, we will have fundamentally transformed our society. “We set these ambitious goals not despite the severe difficulties of the present, but because of them. “We set these goals so that the decisions we take now are bolder and we act with greater urgency.” Ramaphosa said the determination that within the next decade that no person in South Africa will go hungry is fundamental to “our” effort to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.
