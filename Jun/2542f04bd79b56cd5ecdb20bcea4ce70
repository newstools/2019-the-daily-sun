BAFANA Bafana coach Stuart Baxter spent some time alone in the hotel gymnasium yesterday pumping the weights as he alternated the sessions with jogging on the treadmill. Hopefully, this could be the session the coach needed after all to clear his head to be able to come up with a better game strategy and alternative tactics against Namibia tonight (10pm). The second Group D fixture at Al Salam Stadium is a must-win for Bafana if they are to keep within the distance of joint leaders Morocco and Ivory Coast. The Atlas Lions of Morocco and The Elephants are on three points apiece after they each won by 1-0 margins over the two Cosafa member countries in the group’s opening round. Namibia coach Ricardo Mannetti warned after their loss last Sunday that they would decide who advance to the knockout stage, even if the Brave Warriors don’t make it. But Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu said the feedback at the team’s debriefing sessions was more about getting things right in the attack, while back-up striker Lars Veldwijk also emphasised the need for the team to wake up and smell the coffee. “First of all we are disappointed with the result against Ivory Coast, who are one of the big teams in the tournament,” said Holland-based Veldwijk. “It doesn’t change much for the game against Namibia because even if we had drawn or won against Ivory Coast, we still have to beat Namibia. We need to keep the confidence and if everyone is on the same level, we’ll beat Namibia,” added the tall striker, who came on as substitute against the Ivorians. Added Zungu: “We’re hoping for a big performance. We need to be more mobile on and off the ball. We should get it right and win the game. For me, it doesn’t matter how we get a result, but we just need to grind the results.” Baxter has also hinted that fresh legs could be introduced for tonight’s match. And Zungu could possibly be among those changes.
