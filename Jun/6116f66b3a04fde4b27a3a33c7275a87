South Africa's darling Zodwa Wabantu is always down to have good fun. This time, Zodwa taught American TV sensation, the Street Outlaws how to Vosho and Gwara Gwara at the hip Chesterville shisanyama Cafe Skyzer in Durban. The Street Outlaws are in South Africa for the launch of VP Race Fuels at the Gas Motorshow happening this weekend. The trio head to Cornubia Mall in Umhlanga on Saturday for fan signing sessions.
