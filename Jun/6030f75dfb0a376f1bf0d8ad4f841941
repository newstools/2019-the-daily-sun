THEY fear their kids may be swallowed by a manhole outside their councillor’s office. Residents of Wells Estate in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun the huge manhole had been left open for many years. But their complaints to the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality fell on deaf ears. Resident Nomsa Mfundo (21) said they used the place as a bus stop and taxi rank. “Some people sit on it while waiting for transport. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.” Another resident Thabo Mafana (35) said he worked night shift as a security guard. “I come back late from work and I get dropped off outside the councillor’s office. “The site’s dangerous, especially when it rains as the manhole cannot be seen.” Ward Councillor Mvuzo Mbelekane said the manhole was badly constructed. “I have complained about this before to the municipality because it poses a danger to residents, especially children. The manhole is deep and dangerous. Its top lid was badly moulded and does not fit properly over the hole. “I’m making an effort to close it and put in a pipe that drains water from the area. The stormwater drain was originally meant to do that job, but it is now giving us a headache,” he said.
