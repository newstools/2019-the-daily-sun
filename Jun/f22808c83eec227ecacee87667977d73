THE moment of truth has finally arrived for Bafana Bafana! Stuart Baxter has named his starting team for the tricky fixture against Ivory Coast starting in an hour’s time at Al Salaam Stadium in Cairo (4.30pm). Among the surprise choices is Ronwen Williams who starts in goals ahead of Darren Keet. Lebohang Maboe has also been curiously been picked for a starting place ahead of Thembinkosi Lorch and Thulani Serero. Serero started in the Afcon qualifier decider against Libya. However, the preparations have been done, prayers have been said and it is now up to Stuart Baxter’s men to go out perform. Not only will victory set the tone for the rest of the tournament, but it will also inspire confidence and ensure the skeptical football public gets fully behind them. Thulani Hlatshwayo leads the team, playing alongside his Buhle Mkhwanazi in the heart of defence, behind Dean Furman and Kamohelo Mokotjo.  Bafana Bafana starting XI: Ronwen Williams, Sfiso Hlanti, Buhle Mkhwanazi, Thulani Hlatshwayo (c), Thami Mkhize, Kamohelo Mokotjo, Dean Furman, Lebo Maboe, Themba Zwane, Percy Tau, Lebo Mothiba. Substitutes: Darren Keet, Bruce Bvuma, Innocent Maela, Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Daniel Cardoso, Hlompho Kekana, Tiyani Mabunda, Bongani Zungu, Thulani Serero, Thembinkosi Lorch, Lars Veldwijk, Sbusiso Vilakazi.
