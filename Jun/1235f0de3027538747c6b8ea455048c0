Pan-African youth are being encouraged to consider agri-food opportunities as a possible career path. African telecommunications, media and technology group Econet and global crop nutrition leader Yara International ASA launched Generation Africa, an initiative aimed to inspire young African entrepreneurs to join the agri-food sector. It is expected to reach thousands of young people throughout Africa through its “GoGettaz” competition, which will award R1,45 million in prize money to two exceptional business ventures in the agri-food sector. The initiative will support 12 budding young agri-food entrepreneurs to scale and prosper their ventures. “Africa’s agri-food sector presents a US$ 1-trillion business opportunity by 2030, especially when connected with the current technology revolution. “Across Africa’s agri-food chain, innovations can be found in how we grow, harvest, process, store, transport, package, sell and consume food,” said Yara President and CEO Svein Tore Holsether. Econet founder and Group Chairman Strive Masiyiwa: “Africa is full of entrepreneurs. We have more entrepreneurs than any other continent. But where the average age of an entrepreneur is 19, the average age of a farmer is 60! “The time is now for Africa’s entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and embrace the incredible opportunities that agri-food businesses offer. “If we do not, someone else will.” The competition is open to young agri-food entrepreneurs aged between 18 and 35. Budding ventures can be submitted via www.genafrica.org by 15 July. Twelve finalists will be selected by a panel to pitch live at the African Green Revolution Forum in Accra, Ghana, from 3 till 6 September.
