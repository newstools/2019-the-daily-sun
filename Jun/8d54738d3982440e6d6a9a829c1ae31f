YEARS ago, the people’s cry for a foot bridge was heard and they were happy when it was built. But now they fear the bridge that connects Phola Park and Mountain View in KwaMhlanga has become a serious crime hot spot. When night comes, it becomes a no-go zone. People said since it was built, four people have died there. They said the latest incident happened a week ago, when a badly injured man was found lying under the bridge. He later died in hospital. Angry residents told Daily Sun the only thing to reduce the crime would be the installation of a high mast light. Khuzani Mtsweni (38) said thugs mug people and threaten to throw them off the bridge. “When people cross at night, they are followed by two thugs and others come in front. When you resist, they throw you off the bridge into the river. “The bridge helps us to move between the two villages,” he said. Mumsy Masemola (29) said in winter, it was risky to cross the bridge. “When it’s dark, rather walk the distance than trying to cross at the bridge. “People appear from nowhere and corner you. People have died there and now we are scared. “We don’t want another death.” Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said no cases had been reported and urged residents to report all crime to the police.
