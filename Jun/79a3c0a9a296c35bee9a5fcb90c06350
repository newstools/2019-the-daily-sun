SA Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan believes the current crop of Bafana Bafana players have what it takes to succeed at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt. They are hoping to emulate the class of 1996 who remain the only South Africa team to win the continental trophy.However, Jordaan is confident that Stuart Baxter’s charges can surprise many by ending the 23-year drought for a trophy. Speaking at the hotel where Bafana are based in Cairo, Jordaan said he was “convinced” that this team would bring joy to faces of many supporters. Jordaan along with Sports and Recreation minister Nathi Mthethwa and Mamelodi Sundowns president Patrice Motsepe are in Egypt and took the opportunity to spur Bafana on. Baxter’s charges open their campaign with a clash against the Ivory Coast at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo today (16h30). “I saw this team over a long period of time,” said Jordaan.“I think two moments standout from this team, the first was when we beat Nigeria 2-0 in Nigeria. The second one was when we beat Libya in Sfax. Those two moments convinced me that the time of ‘sorry, we should’ve, we could’ve’ is over. “This team has a moment now to introduce the next generation of players that can bring joy to the faces of many South Africa football fans, and that’s what they are expecting today. “We can do it, I have seen all the other games. We are probably the best footballing team in the tournament. The only team that comes close is Senegal. “But in football, it’s not about what you do in training or what you say, it’s about what you do on the field.”
