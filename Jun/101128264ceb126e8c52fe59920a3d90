A MAN was arrested after he was found manufacturing and mixing drugs in Tzaneen, Limpopo, on Tuesday. Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “The drug lab was uncovered in a house around the plots on the outskirts of Tzaneen town. “The suspect, who’s believed to be a drug lord, was arrested in the house,” said Ngoepe. “Cops found dagga in the lab, and the man was in possession of three unlicensed guns and ammunition.” The estimated street value of the drugs is about R200 000. “Acting provincial police commissioner General Jan Scheepers has praised the cops for their commitment in the fight against the mushrooming drug trade around the province,” he told Daily Sun. The team was made up of crime intelligence, crime prevention and K9 units. The suspect will appear in court soon.
