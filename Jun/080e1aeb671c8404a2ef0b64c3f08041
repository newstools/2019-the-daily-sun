Former Minister of Sport and Recreation comrade Tokozile
Xasa has joined the long list of MPs to have called it quits. The Office of the ANC Chief Whip has confirmed the
resignation of Xasa as an ANC Member of Parliament. The ANC’s Chief Whip’s spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said Xasa’s
resignation is effective from 07 June 2019. “Comrade Xasa will be replaced by comrade Judy Hermans on
the National-to-National list, while comrade Makhosini Nkosi was replaced by
comrade Lindiwe Mjobo on the Province-to-National list of KwaZulu Natal,” Mhlauli
said. Mhlauli further said Hermans will therefore still be
sworn-in on Monday 10 June 2019 with the rest of the other MPs who are
scheduled to take up seats in the National Assembly.
