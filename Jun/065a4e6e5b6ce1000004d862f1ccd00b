RESIDENTS have already started rebuilding their shacks. This after they were chased away by eThekwini municipal guards on Tuesday. Residents from Richmond Farm, Durban, said they won’t move, even if the guards demolish their shacks again. Six shacks were demolished. Residents claimed guards fired rubber bullets as they tore down shacks. A child (2) and another resident were hurt. Khosi Radebe (26), whose child was injured, said she was in her shack when the guards arrived. “They shouted that I must get out. As I was leaving they started firing rubber bullets. I ran, carrying my baby on my back, but they shot at her.” She said her daughter’s back swelled up and she took her to the clinic. Another resident, Sandile Sithole (49), said they have been waiting for RDP houses for several years. “We decided to build shacks after we saw this open land. Now the councillor sends guards to shoot at us. We won’t move out of the area!” Councillor Nokufika Biyela said: “I didn’t call the guards to demolish their shacks. “They often monitor municipal land and remove people invading it.” Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said the guards work within the law when dealing with land invaders. “Regarding this incident, we are going to find out from the relevant department what happened,” he said. KZN police spokeswoman Nqobile Gwala said no case was opened.
