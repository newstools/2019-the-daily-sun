THOUSANDS of ANC Youth League members marched to the ANC headquarters in Joburg because they wanted what they called the big belly leadership to be removed. The marchers said the leaders, including president Collen Maine and secretary General Njabulo Nzuza, don’t serve the youth. They said they use the youth league as a vehicle for their selfish needs such as parliamentary positions and self-enrichment. Names of dead politicians such as Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko were mentioned while impepho was burnt to call on the spirits of former youth league leaders to force the ANC NEC to listen to their grievances. Thabo Mabotja of the Philip Legodi branch in Seshego said the youth are tired of toothless leaders with questionable legitimacy. “We are going to make sure that from now on, moving forward, we are going to make sure we continue with the struggle,” he said. “We sent a memorandum and want a response in seven days. If they don’t respond, we will continue with this programme.” Former Cosas president Wesley Kgang said the ANC NEC must take the elders out. Meanwhile, Maine and Nzuza were sworn in as MPs during the first sitting of the sixth parliament. Daily Sun tried to contact them but their phones rang unanswered. They had not responded at the time of going to print.
