DJ Shimza has gotten himself some new expensive wheels. A white Mercedes Benz G63 that will cost a few millions! This after his previous maroon G63 was allegedly stolen in February from his home in Joburg  never recovered. READ: SHIMZA NEVER RECOVERED HIS STOLEN CAR! Shimza had asked fellow South Africans to help him find his car but unfortunately, he had no luck! A few months down the line Shimza seems to be riding a brand new Mercedes beast . He shared this on social media, “Some blessings come in the form of pain, you are not cursed you are just being prepared for better things” he wrote. We couldn't agree more! When you lose something God replaces it with an even better version of it! Some blessings come in the form of pain, you are not cursed you are just being prepared for better things ??
