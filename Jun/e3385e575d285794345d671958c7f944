TWO women who were looking for work on a farm were allegedly moered by a farmer. This was after he accused them of stealing. Tshiamiso Metswamere and her friend, Priscilla Mogorosi, are now nursing their injuries. The incident happened in Sannieshof near Agisanang kasi, North West. Priscilla said she wondered why, if they were really stealing, the farmer didn’t hand them over to the police. “He grabbed us and hit us with a fan belt on our thighs and bums. “He asked us what we were doing on his farm. We told him we were looking for a job,” said Priscilla as she showed the SunTeam bruises on her swollen right thigh. Tshiamiso said the farm workers laughed at them instead of helping them. “We felt humiliated and disrespected. He doesn’t respect women. His wife also wanted to beat us. We sustained injuries for no reason. “We went there to look for work, not to steal,” she said. North West police spokesman Sam Tselenyane confirmed the incident. “The accused is still on the run. He will face charges of assault once he is arrested. “The victims sustained injuries on the thighs and buttocks,” he said.
