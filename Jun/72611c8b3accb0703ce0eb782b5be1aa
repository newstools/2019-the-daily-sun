RELIEF and joy filled the Mbatha household when baby Nhlamolo arrived home after being kidnapped. The family from Makapanstad, North West spent the long weekend searching for the seven-month old baby. He was eventually found at Gomorrah squatter camp, 69km from home. The baby’s mum, Bathabile Mbatha (32) said on Saturday morning their neighbour asked her if she could take the baby to the mall because she wanted to buy him clothes. “At first I agreed but then I had a bad feeling about her taking my baby so I told her that I’d changed my mind.” Bathabile said later in the afternoon she left the baby with his gogo to attend a baby shower. “I received a shocking phone call from my sister who told me that my baby had been kidnapped,” she said. She rushed home to search but Nhlamolo couldn’t be found. Then they received a tipoff that the neighbour and the baby were at a squatter camp west of Tshwane. Bathabile’s mother, Johanna Mbatha (57) said she blamed herself for the child being kidnapped. She said she was carrying the baby when the neighbour snatched him. “I believe she drugged me because I don’t know what happened . I remember seeing her leaving the yard with the child but I couldn’t scream,” she said. “The police arrested her. I hope they throw away the key,” she said. She said the woman told her boyfriend the child was her baby. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that they have arrested a 22-year-old woman for kidnapping.
