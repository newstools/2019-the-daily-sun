PARENTS want action taken against a principal seen in a video appears to be strangling a pupil. In the video, taken on 28 May, the principal of a high school in Nquthu, northern KZN, is seen holding the boy in front of fellow pupils after allegedly catching him with a cellphone. According to a parent, some pupils decided to take videos of the scuffle. “When the principal realised pupils had shared the video he took their cellphones and searched them so he could delete it,” she said. She said he found the video on four pupils’ cellphones and suspended them. Another parent said: “He has the right to punish the pupils as they are not allowed to take cellphones to school. But the way he did it was not appropriate. “We want the department to deal with him accordingly.” The uncle of the pupil who was allegedly throttled said he wanted to meet the principal. “When we meet him we will produce the medical report and the video,” he said. KZN Department of Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they had not seen the video. “We don’t allow pupils to carry cellphones in classrooms. But we also don’t allow this kind of behaviour from teachers.” Daily Sun tried to reach the principal for comment but in vain.
