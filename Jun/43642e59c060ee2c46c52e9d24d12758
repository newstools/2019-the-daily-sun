THE way the 2019 edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt has started, it is not completely unlikely that an underdog will triumph at the end to lift the coveted trophy. Uganda kicked off their campaign with a shock 2-0 victory over the Democratic Republic of Congo and currently sit top of Group A above hosts Egypt and Zimbabwe. The victory was the first in 43 years at the tournament for the Cranes who had last won in 1976 when they finished as runners up to hosts Ghana. While many debutants often struggle and end up making early exits at the tournament, this year’s newcomers Burundi and Madagascar appear to have other ideas. Although Burundi went down 1-0 to Nigeria in their opener, their overall performance suggested that they would more than hold their own in Group B which also consists of Guinea and fellow newbies Madagascar. The Swallows, as Burundi are also known, gave the Super Eagles a huge scare despite the loss and will be hoping to earn their first victory of the tournament against Madagascar at Alexandria Stadium on Thursday (4.30pm). Madagascar, on the other hand, managed to register their first ever point at the tournament when they held Guinea to a 2-2 draw on Saturday. Anicet Andrianantenaina had the honour of scoring his country’s first ever goal at the Afcon when he headed in the equaliser after Sory Kaba had put Guinea ahead in the first half. The Islanders could very well have snatched all three points after Charles Carolus Andriamahitsinoro gave them the lead in the 55th minute, but Guinea spared their blushes with an equaliser through Francois Kamano. The two sides are considered the underdogs in Group B and are not expected to progress to the knockout stages of the new look 24-team tournament. Meanwhile, the favourites to make it out of the group, the Super Eagles of Nigeria and the National Elephants of Guinea, will lock horns in the other Group B encounter on Wednesday at the same venue.
