ACTRESS and TV personality Khanyi Mbau’s skin bleaching routine has always been an issue of contention and for years she has tried to wade off critics, who often use social media to vent their anger about her decision to bleach her skin. While she was on top the moon recently after buying herself a Porsche, the star has come under fire again for her looks after posting latest pictures of herself on social media. But, in a dramatic turn of events, the star clapped back on her twitter account: “Now, type in Khanyi Mbau on google search. go far back as 2005 and see how ur opinions mean nothing to me from when I dated ur fathers, and taught you Botox and that men must buy woman cars etc YALL BEEN TALKING. Things ur idols are doing a decade later”. However, despite the criticism, the actress seems happy and content with herself.
