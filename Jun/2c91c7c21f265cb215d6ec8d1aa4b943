ANOTHER portrait set Twitter on fire this week. Young artist Promise Lubisi shared a portrait he made of superstar DJ Black Coffee and it soon went viral. The drawing even caught the attention of the DJ, whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo. He said he didn’t know the person in the sketch. Soon people were tweeting that Promise was the new Rasta, who’s often mocked for his bad portraits of famous people. Daily Sun spoke to Rasta, who shared his opinion of the drawing. “You can tell that is Black Coffee, but he looks young. If it were painted, it would look like him,” he said. Rasta said Promise could learn a lot from him and stressed the importance of practising. “As an artist, you will work on a piece over and over until it gains features that make it look good.” Promise could not be reached for comment.
