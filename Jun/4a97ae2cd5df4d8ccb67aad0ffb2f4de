THE man whose headless body was found at a dump on Sunday won’t be buried any time soon. Muzikayise Maduna (23) from KwaDabeka, west of Durban was found without his head, right hand, 4-5, heart and intestines. His brother-in-law Sibongiseni Ngcobo (40) said they couldn’t bury the body with missing organs and were also waiting for the police to double-check his identity. He said they were sure the body belonged to Muzikayise, because people went to give him food as they always did on the day he was found dead. “They found him dead and called the police. We were also given a call and we found it was him.” He said Muzikayise has been running away from home since 2005. Sazi Mhlongo, president of the SA Traditional Healers Association, said: “The family must find a powerful inyanga to stop whatever spell evil people intended for his body parts.”
