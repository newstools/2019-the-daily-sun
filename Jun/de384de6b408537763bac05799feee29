ACTING Masuku Primary School principal Themba Shezi is suing Nomarashiya Caluza of the SA Democratic Teachers Union for implicating him of murder. Caluza , the union’s KZN secretary, visited the school in Folweni, south of Durban last Wednesday after teacher Sibonakaliso Nyawose was killed on Tuesday. She recorded a video interview which was circulated on WhatsApp groups. In the video, Caluza said teachers told her they feared for their lives after seeing Shezi near the school with unfamiliar people in the last two weeks. They also complained that in the past Shezi came to school with a firearm, she claimed. She said she was concerned that Nyawose was killed after applying for the principal’s position for which Shezi had also applied. Speaking on behalf of the acting principal, Nkosentsha Shezi told Daily Sun his brother was shocked by Caluza’s allegations and decided to sue her and the union for R3 million for defamation of character. Nkosentsha said the family believes Caluza accused his brother of murder. He said although she didn’t mention him by name, he was the only acting principal. “His rights have been violated and his life put in danger. Her intention was to influence society and Nyawose’s family to see my brother as the killer. He could be killed for what she said.” Caluza said the union has received a summons from Shezi’s lawyers but that they would respond to the court, not the media.
