WHEN a recycling project was started by two madalas started behind their homes, residents didn’t like it! But some in Nellmapius extension 3, east of Tshwane, felt the old men were fighting poverty and keeping the environment clean. Although residents complained about the smell of rubbish and rats, the madalas kept at it. But on Sunday residents held buckets of water, waiting to defend their houses. The project’s warehouse, where plastics, bottles and paper were stored, caught fire. And the madala who owns the place is apparently on the run. Some residents emptied their homes so they wouldn’t lose their belongings. The smoke was so thick and black that those who were guarding with water to douse it gave up and waited for a miracle. Luckily for residents, firefighters arrived in time. Mabel Mokone (50) said her house was engulfed by smoke. She said everything in the house smelled of smoke. She said the project was owned by a neighbour. “We’ve not seen him since the fire. He could at least have apologised. “We understand he was trying to make a living, but this is a residential area.” Another resident, May Mahlangu (60), said: “Metro police should regulate where people can make such businesses.” May said the law should be enforced to avoid such incidents from happening. Emergency services’ Refiloe Thantshang said they responded to the fire and no one was injured.
