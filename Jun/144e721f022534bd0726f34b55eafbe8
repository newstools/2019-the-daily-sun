METRO cop Henry Motene proved he was a SunHero on Monday morning. He found Cecilia Simons stranded on the side of the road. She had run out of petrol and the good Metro cop drove her to the nearest petrol station and paid for her fuel. Cecilia, from Rosettenville in Joburg, was on her way to fetch her daughter when the incident happened on Wemmer Pan Road. In a Facebook post, Cecilia said: “I waited for a taxi but they all passed. A man stopped his car and offered to help but at the same time, a Metro officer pulled over. “I thanked the man but chose to get help from the officer. He took me to the garage and paid for the petrol I needed to get my car started. “We still have ubuntu and beautiful beings in our country. To the Metro police, you have a gem in your midst.” Motene, who had been in the police force for 28 years, said he needed to act swiftly because many people had been mugged in the area. “I was driving to the office when I saw her fiddling with her phone next to the car. I knew she was stranded and needed help,” he said. “I didn’t want another person to fall victim to the growing number of crime incidents in the area.”
