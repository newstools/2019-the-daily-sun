IT HAS taken 25 years, but gogo Alina Africa (81) and her two grandkids walked into their new house on Friday. The gogo from Jagersfontein, Free State, said she never had running water or electricity before, but now she has both and she feels safe. The house was handed over by Free State Human Settlements MEC Motshidisi Koloi, Kopanong mayor Xolile Matwa and representatives of the National Home Builders Council. Senne Bogatsu, a spokesman for Human Settlements, said gogo Alina was identified through a selection process. “Her modern house is made of lightweight steel and has awaterless dry flush toilet system, a soak-away drain, a water tank and a special ceiling to make the house warm.” Gogo is a beneficiary of the house which was built by a company whollly owned by women, Tshitshirisang Construction. Alina said: “I’ve been applying for an RDP since 1994, but with no success. “I thought I would die without owning a house. “I’m happy that I finally have a home for myself and my grandkids. “I’d like to thank the human settlements department and all those who made this possible.”
