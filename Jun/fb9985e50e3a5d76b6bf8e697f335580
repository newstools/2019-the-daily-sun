KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu vowed over the weekend to deal with the issue of bakkies transporting pupils to school. This came after six-year-old Onalo Zondo was killed and 18 others were injured when the bakkie they were travelling in was involved in an accident in Empangeni, northern KZN, on Friday. The accident was allegedly caused by a VW Polo driver who overtook the bakkie. Two passengers in the Polo died and two others were seriously injured. Mshengu said six of the pupils were still being attended to at Ngwelezane Hospital while 12 were discharged on Friday. The MEC visited the injured pupils in hospital on Saturday before going to Onalo’s home in Maqhwakazi Village, Eshowe, to offer his condolences. He said it was shocking that the bakkie was carrying 19 kids. “We’ll meet with law enforcement agencies to come up with a plan to protect pupils.” He said the department needed to make sure pupils weren’t packed into vans. Onalo’s uncle, Sabelo (39), said the family was heartbroken as her dad was buried in March after also dying in an accident.
