THESE were the overwhelming
sentiment by South Africans ahead of President Ramaphosa's first State of the
Nation Address after the elections. To find out what the people wanted
to hear from the President, we hit the streets of Johannesburg and asked. Jobs and crime were the things
mentioned most by many South Africans. Riaad Jones (28) said that he's
been unemployed for more than four months. "What I want to hear the
President talk about is youth unemployment. Not just speak about it, in terms
of implementation. He needs to tell us what are the measures they are going to
take to ensure that there's employment.” Every year we hear that we have
this and this budget for employment but, every year when Stats SA releases
statistics we find that the unemployment rate is still high amongst youth. “Mr President, it is time for the
talking to end and the action to start," Jones said.  Sipho Dhlami (48) said that he
would like the President to address the level of drugs abuse and crime in
schools. "Everything that is wrong in
South Africa now it starts with the teens at school. Communities have given up.
I want the President to tell us how the government will work to curb crime in
schools, how are they going to get involved and ensure that crime in our
communities is reduced," Dhlamini said. Lerato Sikhu (21) said that she
would like the President to look at how to get Graduates jobs. "As
graduates we are sitting here with qualifications, we don't have jobs,"
Lerato said. Zintle Tshitshiba (20) a film
graduate like Lerato said that she wants Ramaphosa to help find struggling film
graduates job opportunities. "I feel like we not getting
enough recognition even though there's a lot of us that are trying to get
there," Zintle said.
