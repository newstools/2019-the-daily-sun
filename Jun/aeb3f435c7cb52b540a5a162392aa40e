A MUM of three has been living in unhealthy conditions for seven years. Elsie Alkaster (57) of Missionvale kasi in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun she never voted for this, but for a better life. “I’m gatvol of empty promises from our political leaders. I voted for them, but I’m still stuck in this pigsty,” said Elsie. She said her living conditions have even affected her kids’ health. “All my kids suffer from TB because of this sewage and rubbish. “The drain in front of my house is a main hole. “It gets fixed but gets clogged up again after a month. When I flush the toilet kak comes out. “I’m forced to use a bucket and throw it outside while my kids relieve themselves in front of my house.” She said a municipal tractor dumps rubbish next to her house. “A week before the election, a municipal official was here. “He promised to help get rid of all this mess, but I’ve never heard from him since. “I’m still stuck in this kak. I have to walk on bricks to get in and out of my house.” Her neighbour Rosemary Links (38) said: “Our bucket system was better than this kak RDP. “Our kids are always sick because they play in the sewage running in front of our houses.” Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “I will refer the matter to waste management to attend to it.”
