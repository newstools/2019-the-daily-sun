THIS creche has been burgled every month since January last year. Thieves would take anything from pots, toys and groceries to chairs and even doors. Last month one of the thugs even left his laptop bag behind. Rebecca Matiwane, principal of Realeboga Pre-school in Zandspruit, Honeydew, said cops were not helping the situation. She said at one stage a zinc dishwashing basin was stolen and they traced the suspect, who confessed to have sold it to a local scrapyard. She reported the case at the Honeydew police station. According to Rebecca, the scrapyard owner and the suspect were arrested, but were out the following morning. “The case never went to court. We’re discouraged because police are not dong their job. Instead, they’re rude to us. “They don’t even bother taking fingerprints. Thugs leave evidence behind, but it’s not collected,” said Rebecca. She showed the SunTeama bag she said was left behind by the suspects. “Our police station has failed us many times,” she said. “The pre-school is a playground for thugs and they keep coming back as they know they won’t be arrested. “We don’t get feedback from police. When we inquire we’re shouted at.” Community leader Kenneth Lekalakala said they helped the creche trace the suspects. He said: “They were handed over to police after taking us to where they had sold the stolen goods.” Sergeant Lerato More said they would investigate.
