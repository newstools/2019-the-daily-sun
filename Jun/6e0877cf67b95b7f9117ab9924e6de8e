CONCERNED groups have called on government to prioritise sexual assault cases. They believe this will stop pimps and customers from killing or abusing magoshas. The Kwanele Movement and the Embrace Dignity Organisation asked for brothels, like the one from which Siam Lee (20) was abducted in January, to be investigated. Siam was found murdered after her abduction. The man accused of killing her has died. Kwanele is Zulu for “enough is enough”. Thabo Tshelane, the two organisations’ spokesman, called on the authorities to enact a law to protect magoshas. He said they handed a memorandum to Durban police in April demanding that massage parlours be closed down. “We demanded an investigation into brothels that masquerade as massage parlours. “They take advantage of desperate women because it’s known women who sell their bodies do it for their children.” He said police hadn’t responded to the demands. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed receipt of the memorandum in April.
