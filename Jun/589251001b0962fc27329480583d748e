THERE were many tears yesterday during the memorial service for the 24 youths killed in a road accident on Youth Day. The families struggled to hold back emotions as the names of those killed were read out. They died when their overloaded taxi collided head-on with a bus on the R81 in Giyani, Limpopo. The joint service was held at the Rapitsi sports ground and attended by hundreds of villagers as the victims came from several villages around Bolobedu. Mokgadi Mohale, whose son Tshepiso (27) was killed, collapsed during the session and was taken out on a stretcher by paramedics. The victims, 19 of whom were pupils, were travelling from Sekgosese Village after celebrating Youth Day. They attended various high schools in the area. Transport MEC Dickson Masemola said: “As the government, we are conducting investigations into this horrific accident. Once it’s ready, it will be released to the families. We are saddened as we honour these 24 souls. Over the past long weekend alone, we lost 44 lives on Limpopo roads.” Phetole Mamepeule of the Modjadji Traditional Authority said they were mourning the deaths with heavy hearts. “We urge people not to point fingers at each other. Rather wait for a formal report from the authorities” he said. Tomorrow there will be a mass funeral service for the 24 victims at the Rapitsi sports ground.
