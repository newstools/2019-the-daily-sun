ZECA “Lollipop” Marques is on the verge of being appointed Maccabi FC coach in the National First Division. Maccabi boss Allan Norman has put his club on sale and wants to see if he will get a buyer by the end of this week. But SunSport understands that Norman’s failure to get a buyer would result in Marques taking over the reins for the coming season to succeed former Leopards and Chippa United coach Joel Masutha. Masutha, who helped Maccabi survive relegation last season, quit from his position to join another NFD side Royal Eagles. Marques confirmed that he has been contacted by Maccabi and he is still waiting for their confirmation by this Friday. “I would like to return to coaching again,” said the 57-year-old Marques. “The only issue standing between us is the sale of the club. But all will be clear by Friday.”
