THE VIDEO, there for all Mzansi to see, shows Babes and Mampintsha having fun in a jacuzzi. But Babes’ father, Reverend Welcome Simelane, is not a happy man. “IF THEY GET BACK TOGETHER, IT WILL BREAK MY HEART.” “Babes is my daughter and her business will always be mine. We’ll only be separated by death.” He didn’t know if Mampintsha and Babes were back together. “I don’t do social media. I only hear rumours from people that they are seen together.” He said he talks to his daughter almost daily but she has never said anything about Mampintsha. Asked if he’d forgive Mampintsha and accept him if the two came to him to ask for his blessings, he said the Bible teaches forgiveness. “But if this happens, it will break my heart,” he said. Simelane said he hated gender-based violence. “Whether it is done to my child or anyone else, I just hate it.” On Wednesday, the gqom sensation posted a video clip on Twitter of herself and Mampintsha in a jacuzzi. Babes is wearing a black swimsuit and sliding next to Mampintsha, in his jocks. Babes touches her boobs while Mampintsha does moves behind her. On the video, posted by Babes, is a short caption: “Happy birthday. I love you, Mampintsha.” The couple laid assault charges against each other earlier this year after a video surfaced showing Mampintsha assaulting Babes. They’ve attended relationship counselling. The phones of Babes and sister Nondumiso Simelane went to voicemail. Mampintsha couldn’t be reached for comment.
