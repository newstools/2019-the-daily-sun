THE challenge has been thrown at Bafana Bafana to make South
Africa proud and qualify for the last-16 stage of the Africa Cup of Nations
(Afcon) by avoiding defeat against Morocco on Monday night (6pm). Bafana are currently placed third on the Group D table with
three points, following their 1-0 win against Namibia in their second Afcon
match on Friday, which was on the back of a slender 1-0 loss to Ivory Coast
last week. Percy Tau, the Royale Union Saint-Gilloise star, who is on
loan from Brighton & Hove Albion, said: “As a group, we want to go to a
point where we are at our best with more minutes and good results.” He said they wanted to reach to a stage where they would say
“this was our best performance”. “Hopefully we will gradually get to that point,” said the 25-year-old Tau, who hails from Witbank. “We are trying to get by on every match, which counts.” He jokingly said they are hoping to put in a few past the Moroccan
goalkeeper on Monday and celebrate better than Bongani Zungu, who scored the
goal against Brave Warriors of Nambia on Friday. “It gave us three goals. Zungu doesn’t know how to celebrate
goals. He can’t dance. Hopefully in the next match he will be dancing with us
after we score,” said Tau jokingly to what could be the best morale booster in camp
