A CANADIAN fertility doctor’s licence was revoked on Tuesday for having used the wrong sperm, including his own, to inseminate patients over decades. Bernard Barwin’s behaviour was deemed “appalling” and “reprehensible” by a College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario disciplinary panel, which fined him Canadian $10 000 (R109 000). The 80-year-old doctor did not appear at the hearing, but through his lawyers pleaded no contest. Barwin had already given up his medical licence in 2014 after being disciplined in a prior case for artificially inseminating three women with the wrong sperm, which he blamed at the time on simple errors. By now revoking his licence, other medical regulators will be alerted if he seeks to practise medicine in other jurisdictions. Barwin is also facing a lawsuit alleging 50-100 births with the wrong sperm, including 11 cases in which he used his own. His misconduct came to light after one of the children born through insemination became curious about her genetic background and researched her family tree. Rebecca Dixon said she learned three years a go at age 25 that Barwin was her biological father, telling the hearing that she felt “repulsed” and “contaminated”. So far, she said she has found 15 half-siblings and expects the number to grow. – NEWS24
