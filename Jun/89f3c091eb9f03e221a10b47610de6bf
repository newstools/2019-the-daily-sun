Mahsaba said thugs are tormenting communities and emphasised thatbif the community works together with the law enforcement, change is possible. “We also have a high unemployment rate which  can also easily draw the youth into doing and dealing with drugs. We have are still working on having more campaigns and programmes to get the youth off the streets,” said Mashaba. “Common health issues found in victims may be from substance abuse problems or addictions resulting from either being coerced into drug use by their traffickers or by turning to substance abuse to help cope with or mentally escape their desperate situations. Partnering with substance abuse treatment programs that are also trauma-informed can be critical when developing your victim services committee. Some human trafficking victims struggle with substance abuse, which may have been exploited by the trafficker,” he added.
