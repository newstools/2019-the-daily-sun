NOW that the Constitutional Court has decriminalised the use and private cultivation of dagga in September last year, do you know how this will affect your health insurance claim? Given the negative stigma associated with dagga users, it is understandable that South Africans are afraid to disclose dagga use when signing up for life cover. But when you enter into an agreement with an insurer, the contract is based on confidential trust. According to Liberty Life, it is important to be honest about your use of dagga. “Don’t be afraid to disclose your dagga use. It’s legal, after all,” said Dr Dominique Stott, Liberty’s Chief Medical Officer. Using dagga in itself is not an illegal act, so claims won’t be rejected if the policyholder was using it in their private capacity. “If you’re not sure about what to disclose, disclose it anyway and let the underwriters decide how this needs to be managed,” said Dr Stott. “If your financial adviser fills in the insurance application form for you, carefully read everything carefully before attaching your signature.”
