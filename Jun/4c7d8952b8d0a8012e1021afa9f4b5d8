SARS yesterday announced people earning less than R500 000 a year would not have to file tax returns. The announcement was made by commissioner Edward Kieswetter at a briefing in Tshwane. He said they decided to increase the threshold from R350 000 to R500 000 annual salary to encourage people to follow tax laws. He said for people not to have to submit their tax returns, they also needed to have received an income from only one employer for a full tax year. Kieswetter encouraged people to use online platforms such as eFiling and the new Sars MobiApp to file their income tax returns. Kieswetter announced that those who would be filing their returns electronically could do so between the first of next month and 4 December. For those filing at Sars branches, the tax period would be between 1 August and 31 October. Speaking about his first month in office, Kieswetter said there was low morale, fear and racial tension among staff members.
