Now is the time to focus on implementation. It is time to
make choices.” “Some of these
choices may be difficult and some may not please everyone,” said President
Cyril Ramaphosa at the State of the Nation address 2019 in Cape Town on Thursday. Ramaphosa said that in an economy that is not growing, at
a time when public finances are limited, “we” will not be able to do everything
at one time. His new administration
will focus on seven priorities:  - Economic transformation and job creation - Education, skills and health - Consolidating the social wage through reliable and
quality basic services - Spatial integration, human settlements and local
government - Social cohesion and safe communities - A capable, ethical and developmental state - A better Africa and World  “All our programmes and policies across all departments
and agencies will be directed in pursuit of these overarching tasks. At the same time,
we must restore the National Development Plan to its place at the centre of our
national effort, to make it alive, to make it part of the lived experience of
the South African people. At the
inauguration, we said that this is a defining moment for our young nation. We also said that
it is through our actions now that we will determine our destiny.”
