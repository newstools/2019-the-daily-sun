MANGOSUTHU University of Technology honoured Mangosuthu Buthelezi with a statue on Friday. The university unveiled the statue to mark its 40th anniversary. Vice-chancellor Duma Malaza said management felt they should honour and thank Buthelezi for building the institution 40 years ago. He said Buthelezi’s passion for education inspired him to look for funds to build a university to cater for black students. He was honoured at the first public lecture on Saturday night, which was given by historian and motivational speaker Dr Moss Mashamaite. “We must thank you, Shenge for building such an important institution. We appreciate your passion for the black child’s education. You are one of my top 10 leaders,” he said. Buthelezi thanked the university for honouring him and said he was impressed by the vice-chancellor’s work. He said he had achieved a lot of things in a short time.
