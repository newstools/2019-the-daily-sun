A 42-year-old woman remains in police custody for alleged fraud
committed while she was an employee at a major bank. Phindile Shabangu appeared in the Secunda Magistrate's Court,
after she was arrested on Friday. Police investigations revealed that Shabangu, allegedly
transferred and withdrew clients’ money. Police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said this transpired
after some clients noticed from their bank statements that some of their money
was missing. “The bank investigated and realised that the transactions
were allegedly dealt with and authorised by the suspect, around an estimated
whopping R500 000,” Bhembe said. The suspect reportedly disappeared upon realising that an
investigation was being conducted. After failing to pitch for work, cops visited her home
without any luck but they, managed to trace her in Komatipoort, where she was
arrested. Bhembe said she was remanded in custody pending bail
application and will appear in court again on 27 June 2019.
