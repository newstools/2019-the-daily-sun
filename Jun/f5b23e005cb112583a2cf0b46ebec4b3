RESIDENTS of Canterton kasi, Hankey, are gatvol. They told Daily Sun they’re tired of living near a dam of kak. The kak affects people who live near Vumazonke and Mjijwa streets. They said they wanted the Kouga Municipality to drain the dam. Residents complained about the bad smell and worms coming into their homes. Phillecia Fortun said she had been living near the dam for 22 years, and had lost count how many times her yard had been flooded. She lives with her two kids and two grandchildren. “The only way to bring peace to us is to drain this dam,” she told the People’s Paper. “How can they allow raw sewage to come into our houses? We have rescued many people from drowning in that dam.” Another resident said her house was constantly swamped with flies and worms from the dam. “We keep our windows and doors closed because of the bad smell. We don’t even allow our kids to play close to the dam,” she said. “The municipality fenced off this place last month after we complained but our kids easily crawl under the fence.” Freddy Campher of the Kouga Municipality said their technical services team will monitor the dam. “Our main focus going forward will be to prevent sewer blockages at the pump station to minimise spills,” he said.
