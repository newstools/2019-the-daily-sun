UNDISPUTED cruiserweight champion, Oleksandr Usyk, has been named mandatory challenger for the winner of between Anthony Joshua's heavyweight-title rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr by the WBO. Usyk was the first boxer to hold all four major world titles (WBC, WBO, WBA and IBF at cruiserweight) when he won the World Boxing Super Series tournament last year. He has moved up a division to campaign in the heavyweight class. The former Olympian pulled out of his heavyweight debut against Carlos Takam in May because of injury. The move by the 32-year-old fighter brings about hope to the highly rated local cruiserweight fighters such as IBO champion Kevin “Two Guns” Lerena, Thabiso Mchunu and the SA-based DR Congo-born WBC Silver cruiserweight Ilunga Makabu Jnr as he left WBC, IBF and WBO titles vacant. The 29-year-old Ruiz stunned Joshua to win the IBF, WBA and WBO titles on 1 June and is under contract to take a rematch. The winner of the proposed rematch between Joshua and Ruiz will hold three of the four major world titles, with WBC champion Deontay Wilder in possession of the other. The rematch has been mooted for later this year, possibly in New York. The 2012 Olympic champion's final bout in the lighter division came in November when he knocked out Tony Bellew- a seventh successful world tile victory. He is unbeaten in 16 professional fights, with 12 knock-out wins. Usyk is now positioned to face Joshua or Ruiz but the title holder could also vacate the WBO belt should they wish to pursue another avenue.
