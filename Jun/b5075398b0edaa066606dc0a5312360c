FORMER NPA spokesman Tsepo Ndwalaza has dumped the prosecuting authority to become a DA councillor. He was sworn in as a Nelson Mandela Bay councillor at the continuation yesterday of last Thursday’s council meeting at which the council tried for the third time to pass the city’s R12,6 billion budget. Ndwalaza was sworn in along former Nelson Mandela University student leader Nicholas Nyati, Jacobus Botha and Lesley Booysen. They replace four DA councillors who resigned after last month’s general election. Ndwalaza said: “I saw the need for me to work with the community because I have been with the NPA for 11 years. It’s time for me to move out of my comfort zone.” He said the DA was the only party that could make changes to benefit people. “I’m happy to be a councillor because I will be able to fight for them to get better services,” he said. Yesterday, the council once again failed to pass the budget. Speaker Buyelwa Mafaya adjourned the meeting after she found out a meeting to rectify the budget had not taken place.
