Forgotten former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Mogakolodi Ngele has resurfaced in Venda as one of the latest additions to the Black Leopards team. The Botswana international will be eager to revive his ailing career with Lidoda Duvha after spending the whole of last season training on his own.  Ngele only played 16 games in all competitions for Downs, scoring twice in what was a torturous spell in Chloorkop. The 28-year-old came to South Africa in 2012, joining now defunct Platnum Stars from Township Roller in the Botswana Premier League. Ngele enjoyed a good spell out on loan to Bidvest Wits in 2016/17 playing 23 matches in all competitions and scoring six goals to help Gavin Huntâ€™s men win their maiden Absa Premiership title. He will now be hoping to get back to his best and help Lidoda Duvha have a memorable season in the Absa Premiership. Check out some of Ngele's best moments below:
