Cassper is done with the SAMAs and would rather perform in another country than attend them! “It's not negative. It's my truth. I would rather get paid to perform in another country than attend the SAMAs.” This bitter truth follows Cassper’s boycotting of the  awards after they  snubbed his hit song Doc Shebeleza. It seems as if the rapper is still not over this and he continues to bash the awards. “Nah, I'd rather take a cheque over a SAMA. It doesn't have any value anymore.” Cassper wrote in response to a fan asking if he is attending this year. He insists that he is not hating but with Cassper you never know!
