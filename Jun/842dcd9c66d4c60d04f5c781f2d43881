A TRIP to the mall has restored a gogo’s faith in humanity! The 65-year-old pensioner was surprised by a security guard at Mayville Mall, Tshwane, when he returned money and some documents she had forgotten in a trolley. Sandra Bekker said she went to the mall to renew her licence disc. She also withdrew her pension money. “After I was finished at the post office, I went grocery shopping,” she said. “A security guard helped me load my groceries into the boot. I was distracted and didn’t realise I’d left the envelope in the trolley.” She said the envelope had valuable documents and R1 300 in cash. Sandra said she was already at home when she received a surprising phone call. It was mall guard Henry Male who told her he had found her envelope with cash and documents. “He’d found it and my phone number was on the documents so he called me. I was so impressed with his honesty.” The guard recognised her from her ID. “I couldn’t thank him enough. “I rewarded him with R200 as a thank-you. “I get goosebumps every time I think about it.” Daily Sun couldn’t get hold of the SunHero His act of kindness has resulted in people digging deep in their pockets to give back to him.
