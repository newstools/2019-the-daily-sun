Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan announced on
Tuesday that Eskom's unbundling would go ahead and that there was no deviation
from that plan.  Gordhan was speaking during the debate on the State of the
Nation Address. Following his address last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa came
under fire from critics for his failure to further outline details on how the
embattled power utility would be unbundled.  Unions have also said that they have not been privy to any
meetings, barring one, on the matter since Ramaphosa first announced the
unbundling in February.  'No deviation'  On Tuesday, Gordhan said the recommendation to restructure
Eskom was based on both international trends and a study of Eskom itself.  "Eskom has begin to develop a road map to implement the
proposals in the February 2019 SONA: to separate its Generation, Transmission
and Distribution functions into three separate business entities, wholly-owned
by the State," Gordhan said.  "There is no deviation from this strategic path – not
in Cabinet or in government – contrary to persistent public speculation."  Gordhan said Eskom’s separation would provide a number of
other benefits, including greater transparency of financial and operational
performance, in each entity.  He went on to list some of the details being looked at,
which include power transfer polices and contracts, internal structural
organisation, financial reporting and auditing processes per business division,
among other things.  "Government will ensure that appropriate consultations
will occur, in particular with organised labour on the implementation of the
Separation Project," he said.  https://www.fin24.com/Economy/eskom-unbundling-will-go-ahead-says-gordhan-20190625
