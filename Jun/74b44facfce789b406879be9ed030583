Around one in three women have been on a date just to get a free meal, according to new research. Daily Mail reports that more than 1,000 women were studied, with the vast majority being heterosexual. The study found that between 23 per cent to 33 per cent had engaged in a 'foodie call' Dubbed a 'foodie call' by the researchers - it involves a person setting up a date with someone they are not romantically interested in to be wined and dined. Two online studies by psychologists found that 23 per cent to 33 per cent of women say they've engaged in a 'foodie call'. Women who scored high on the three 'dark' personality traits - psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism - were most likely to engage in a foodie call and find it acceptable. Women who believe in traditional gender roles - for example that men should be breadwinners and women should be housewifes - were also more likely to make 'foodie calls'.Although women who had engaged in a foodie call believed it was more acceptable, most women believed foodie calls were extremely to moderately unacceptable.
