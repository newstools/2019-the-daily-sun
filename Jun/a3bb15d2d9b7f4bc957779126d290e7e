BLACK First Land First president Andile Mngxitama laughed loudly, and then said: “It’s very funny!” He was reacting to claims contained in a letter by the BLF’s secretary-general, Siphesihle Jele, that Mngxitama was not a member of the party. “Jele has uncontrollable ambitions for power. He’s lying about my status,” Mngxitama told Daily Sun. He said he was a founding member and that his membership would lapse in 2020. Jele said in the letter to the party’s members and media that Mngxitama and Shantha Balashkrina were not legitimate members of BLF until they proved membership of their branches. Mngxitama said Jele had failed in all the tasks assigned to him and was a liar. He provided Daily Sun with proof of his membership. Mngxitama said Jele had been suspended and was facing serious charges. A statement from BLF’s national co-ordinating committee said: “There is obviously no truth in the allegation that the president of BLF is not a member of a movement he leads.” Mngxitama said as steps were being taken to strengthen BLF after the election, some dead wood would resist the process. But Jele challenged Mngxitama and Balashkrina to prove their membership. He said: “We can’t trace their membership. We have asked them to step aside but they refused. They are responding to us through the media.” .
