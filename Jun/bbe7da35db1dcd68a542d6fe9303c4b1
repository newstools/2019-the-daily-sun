RAPPER Kid Tini said he believed in putting his fans first as they made him who he is today. The 21-year-old from Butterworth in the Eastern Cape, whose real name is Phiwe Tini, said he also wanted to show them that even celebrities faced hardships in life. He told SunBuzz he didn’t want to be like other musicians who sang or rapped about cars, which their fans couldn’t connect with. “I prefer to focus on real life issues,” said the Ambitiouz Entertainment artist. He said young people were afraid to talk about issues such as abortion, teenage pregnancy, depression and suicide, all of which he raps about. “I want to use my talent to be the voice of the voiceless. It is my duty as a musician to do this as many people come and share their stories with me.” In January the rising star released his single Cinga. Itwas about a teenager who fell pregnant and didn’t know what to do. Kid Tini said he wanted to educate and urge young people to take care of themselves. The song was followed by Wedwa last month. Kid Tini released his 15-track mixtape Coming of Age in 2016. He’s worked with DJ Switch as well as rappers Blaklez and PdotO.
