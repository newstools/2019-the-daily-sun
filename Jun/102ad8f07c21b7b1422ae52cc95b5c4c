DISGRUNTLED ANC Youth League members have welcomed the ANC’s national working committee’s support in their fight to disband the league. Scores of ANCYL members marched to Luthuli House last week to voice their unhappiness with their leadership. One of them, Thabo Mabotja, said the intervention of the working committee was a good start. “As far as we are concerned, the youth league doesn’t exist any more. It’s just the logo that is left. “There are no warm bodies any longer, so it’s time we held elections for new leadership.” Mabotja, a member of a faction calling itself Revive ANCYL, said even though they had received no official response to their memorandum, there was progress. “We hope Collen Maine, as an NEC member, will lead by example by seconding the motion. We will be writing to the mother body some time next week. “We are still giving them time to deal with our grievances,” he said.
