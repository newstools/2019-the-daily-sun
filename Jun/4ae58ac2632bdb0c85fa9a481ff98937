THE family of the girl who was allegedly attacked by two pit bulls say they want justice. Siphelele Yayi (12) was apparently bitten by the dogs at a shop in Chris Hani kasi in Uitenhage last Tuesday. Her father Patrick Yayi (58) told Daily Sun: “One of my neighbours sent my daughter to the shop. I had gone with my wife to Laetitia Bam Day Hospital in KwaNobuhle. “While at the hospital, my neighbour arrived and told me my daughter had been attacked by two pit bulls.” He said they rushed to the trauma unit and found his daughter’s leg and foot were badly injured. “She had to have 24 stitches.” Patrick said cops at KwaNobuhle Police Station caused them more heartache. “We went to the cop shop on Wednesday to lay a charge against the dog owner but a woman cop told us we had no case because a dog cannot stand in court and be charged for biting someone. “We only got help after residents protested at the cop shop and we managed to lay a charge on Thursday. “ I want the owner to pay for his negligence. My daughter cries every night and nearly died. The owner knows his dogs are vicious, but his yard is not well secured.” Siphelele said the dogs dragged her from the counter. “Then they bit me. I was saved by another customer,” she said. SPCA inspector Mariaan Wentzel said: “Municipal by-laws do not allow vicious dogs to be kept. The municipality has a right to take these dogs and put them down. “In cases like these, we can only give advice. We’re in no position to seize them.” Captain Gerda Swart said: “A case of assault was opened at KwaNobuhle Police Station. The matter will be sent to the senior state prosecutor for a decision.”
