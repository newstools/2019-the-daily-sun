THE family always feared for Wandiswa’s safety. Wandiswa Kubheka (11) was playing soccer outside the house when he was struck by a stray bullet. The incident happened in Zakheni kasi in Ladysmith on Wednesday afternoon. His family believe Wandiswa took a bullet that was meant for his neighbour Sanele Mngoma (28), who was also shot and killed. Sanele had just stepped into the street when a car stopped next to him and the occupants opened fire. Wandiswa’s uncle Mazwi Kubheka (29) said: “We’re living in fear as several people have been killed. We don’t know who’s next. We’re hurt and trying to come to terms with it.” In the same area last month, Sboniso Madlala (28), son of Alfred Duma mayor Vincent Madlala, was shot and killed. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said two murder cases were opened.
