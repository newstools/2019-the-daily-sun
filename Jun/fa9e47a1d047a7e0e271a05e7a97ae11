ANC chief whip Pemmy Majodina and secretary-general Ace Magashule denied yesterday that the list of nominations for parliament’s committee chairpersons is the outcome of any factional balancing act. The nominations were announced yesterday after an ANC caucus meeting. The list includes names such as Mosebenzi Zwane (Transport), Supra Mahumapelo (Tourism), Tina Joemat-Pettersson (Police), Faith Muthambi (Co-operative Governance) and Bongani Bongo (Home Affairs). It appears MPs and former ministers during Jacob Zuma’s tenure, who are seemingly resistant to being rooted out by state capture and are not basking in the rays of the new dawn, will chair some committees. “When we approach deployment, we don’t approach it in a factional manner,” Majodina said. “Because deployed here are members of the ANC who came out of the process of the list conference.” “Experience, capacity, new people, women and youth are considered in the balancing act, not being led through factional groupings. We did not consider that.” Magashule was singing from the same hymn sheet. “As the chief whip has said, we don’t choose people on a factional basis. So that analysis is not correct,” he said. “As ANC officials, we are very happy that we have been working together consistently. We just read in the media that the secretary-general is going this way, the president that way. It’s not true at all. “Focus on Sona, rather than individuals. Give the president that space and time.” – NEWS24
