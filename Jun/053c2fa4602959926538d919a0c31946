NGAKOANA Makhura (60), who has high blood pressure, claims she has not received her medication since January. The gogo from GaTauyatswala Village in Limpopo said Mankwe Clinic and Thabaleshoba Health Centre staff said her file had to be renewed but nothing has happened and she’s stuck. Makhura said after she gave the file to clinic officials, they said she must give them the date of the year it was opened. “Senior nurses blamed me but I don’t even know when it was opened.” She said her body was reacting badly because she hasn’t had her medication and her thigh that was operated on was aching. She said nurses sent her to the dispensary but they wouldn’t help her without a note or prescription. Neil Shikwambana of Limpopo Health Department said the doctors could fill in her file. “She was told she would get medication and while going for observation, she left it behind and never came back,” he said. “Management is ready to assist her but she is nowhere to be found. “She disappeared from our clinic and now blames the department for not helping her. She can go to the centre any day and she will be assisted.”
