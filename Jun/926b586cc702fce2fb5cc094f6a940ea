WHILE society pays more attention to women and girls because of their vulnerability, a thought must also be spared for boy children. This is the view of Tsakani Mkhari, founder of the Hope Givers Foundation. The Limpopo-based foundation focuses on improving the lives of poor members of communities through education and economic development projects The foundation wants to the change the lives of boy children through its “Raising the Legends” initiative. “Boy children are not getting enough support to become responsible men and good future leaders,” said Tsakani. “What the world fails to grasp is that the boy child faces the same, if not worse, challenges than girls.” She said boys were often neglected and expected to be tough. As a result, they often get involved in criminal activities and substance abuse. “Sometimes even their own parents don’t believe in them. When you save a boy from all this, by defending and fighting for his rights, you save a whole generation. That boy will grow up into a responsible man, father, husband and mentor.” Next month the foundation will host a number of workshops on entrepreneurship and leadership to motivate boys.
