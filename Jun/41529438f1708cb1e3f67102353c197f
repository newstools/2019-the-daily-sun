SOCIAL media personality and beauty vlogger Mihlali Ndamase broke
the internet last night with an Instagram story post from her trip to Paris. She posted a 20 seconds video going into a pool rocking a
bikini and the 5 seconds that her bum is in shot got the people on social media
talking. She trended at number one on Twitter for a few hours.         This isn't the first time Mihlali took over the internet for
something besides her beauty vlogging. Earlier this year she broke the internet with a post of her
bum in a red bikini in Phuket Thailand.  This is how we birthday in Phuket ?? A post shared by  Mihlali Ndamase (@mihlalii_n) on Nov 29, 2018 at 1:05am PST This is how we birthday in Phuket ?? A post shared by  Mihlali Ndamase (@mihlalii_n) on Nov 29, 2018 at 1:05am PST
