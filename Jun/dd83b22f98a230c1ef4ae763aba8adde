Is there anything that the Queen can’t do! The TV personality once again won the hearts of South Africans after she showed off her hidden singing talent during an "audition" for the Idols SA judges recently. It was during the Sunday Times Generation Next pre-award ceremony activities when Bonang scored herself Idol’s Golden ticket! Although the show hasn’t aired yet, it seems that Bonang joined the judges at one of the auditions taking place at the Sandton Convention Centre. In the video, an excited Bonang can be seen introducing herself to the Idol’s judges, before singing Beyoncé’s Irreplaceable while a crowd cheers in the background. Bonang definitely stole the show and ended her performance with a "BOOM!" and if all fails she could become an artist! Fun day it was today. At the GenNext awards. @idolssa stand. With @unathi.co. When @bonang_m made a surprise appearance. Oh and congrats on yo win ms BNG A post shared by  Somizi (@somizi) on Jun 13, 2019 at 12:49pm PDT
