CAF President Ahmad Ahmad was reportedly arrested on Thursday morning at a hotel in France, where he was staying to attend a FIFA Congress. According to African weekly newspaper Jeune Afrique, Ahmed was arrested around 8:30am at the Berri Hotel in Paris. He is to be heard by the services of the Central Office for the fight against corruption and financial and fiscal offenses (Oclif). Ahmad’s arrest is reportedly linked to “the contract unilaterally broken by CAF with German equipment manufacturer Puma to engage with the company Technical Steel instead, based in La Seyne-sur-Mer.” The new contract, which according to the former secretary general of the continental forum Amr Fahmy was favored by the proximity between Ahmad Ahmad and one of the leaders of the French company, came at an additional cost of €739 000 (R12,3 million), the report claims. This comes just hours after CAF ordered that the abandoned second leg of the CAF Champions League final between Esperance and Wydad Casablanca, be replayed at a neutral venue after this month's Cup of Nations.
