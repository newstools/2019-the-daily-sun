MINISTER in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu said Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address shared a thriving future! Speaking in Tshwane yesterday, he said the Sona was about applying the mandate the ANC had from the people. “Working together will improve the lives of South Africans, grow the economy, and address employment issues, poverty and inequality,” Mthembu said. He said Ramaphosa had called on South Africans to work together to overcome challenges and grow the country. “We should grow the industrial sector, strengthen the mining industry, and support the agricultural sector to improve skills for the youth and attract tourists.” He said people should support local industries and buy local products. “Cabinet calls on social partners, businesses, labour, society and political formations to reinforce their efforts in making our country better for all.”
