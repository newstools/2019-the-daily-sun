BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis says they need to take a good look at themselves after their 7-2 thrashing at the hands of Norway. The match, which was Banyana’s final chance to fine tune themselves ahead of the upcoming FIFA Women’s World Cup, took place on Sunday in Amiens, France. Ellis was left disappointed by her side’s showing and believes they will need to improve a great deal if they want to compete at the World Cup. “Not a good day at the office,” admitted Ellis. “We need to be critical of ourselves if we want to move forward, we all could have done better and we need to call each other out because this is the World Cup we are talking about. “The result was deflating, we wanted to do well and end our preparations on a high note but it wasn’t to be, we showed in the second half that we can play, but we need to sustain that for the whole 90 minutes." Ellis rued her side’s slow start to the game, something they have been struggling with of late. Norway led 5-0 at half time and Banyana tried to claw their way back into contention as they managed to score two goals, but it was too little too late. Added Ellis: “We speak about starting our games better, there’s too many times that we lose the game in the opening 30 min. we react well and score a couple goals but we are often too far behind to catch up. “We should have done a lot better, some of the goals we conceded were really poor.“We spoke about the danger players but we didn’t pick them up, we were very loose.“We need to take a deep look at ourselves.”
