 Eskom has announced that it has temporarily withdrawn services to areas where people do not pay their Eskom bills, bypass meter boxes, connect illegally to their network and vandalise electronically infrastructures. The power utility said that the withdrawal of services has caused violent protests to pop up in the affected areas which include, Braamfischer and Klipspruit in Soweto, Ivory Park, Orange Farm and Winterveld in Tshwane. Eskom said that these hotspots experience issues because transformers become overloaded, especially during winter which subsequently cause these transformers to catch fire or explode as they been vandalised. Eskom said that their offices in these hotspots have been targeted. "Eskom is, however, very concerned about the frequent and increased number of incidents where its offices are blockaded, employees are sometimes assaulted, intimidated and in extremes situations, held hostages by some community members," Motlhabane Ramashi, Eskom Operations and Maintenance Manager said in a statement. Eskom said due to the increasing number of these incidents it would not be able to replace mini substations and pole mounted transformers in particular to areas where people are not paying for their electricity. Eskom said that illegal connections mean that they need to replace mini-substations and pole mounted transformers on a regular basis. "This is not sustainable and not in line with Eskom's revenue management practices and efforts to improve its financial and operations objectives. We continue to engage with respective communities to ensure that we resolve the issues of non-payment and safeguard electricity infrastructure for the benefit of our communities," Ramashi said.
