POLICE are asking for help to find the family of an unknown man. The man was found dead in the bush in Ga-Rankuwa zone 3, Tshwane, on Sunday morning. Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said the man was found lying face down not far from the road. He said he could be aged about 30. “He was wearing a pair of blue jeans, a grey top, brown Timberland boots, and brown Daniel Hechter belt – and he’s hefty in build,” said Nkoadi. The cause of death is unknown. “There were no visible injuries or bruises on his body that might suggest assault.” Preliminary investigations suggest he might have been killed somewhere else and dumped at the scene. “Anyone with information on this matter is requested to contact us on the CrimeStop number 0860 010111 or SMS the crime line on 32211,” he said.
