THE friends usually hired a taxi to go to parties.  But they did not come back home on Sunday – the overloaded taxi they were travelling in collided head-on with a bus. The 24 young people were returning from a Youth Day celebration in Polokwane, Limpopo.  Nineteen of them were pupils at various schools in and around Ga-Modjadji. Ntswaki Magobatlou (31) from Ga-Rapitsi, near Ga-Kgapane said it was not the first time her brother Mokwape (14) and his friends had gone to an event. “They left home in two separate taxis. One had the girls, while boys took a different taxi.”  She said the family was shattered. Agnes Seoka (59) said it’s been hard to accept the death of her son Tshepo (18). “He was in grade 10 at Kgapane High. I believed he would help me at home when he finished school.” The family of Shane Ngobeni (18) said they were already missing him. Anna Makola said she was sad her son Temoso Makola (24) died before fulfilling his football dreams. Witness Tiva, Mopani municipal spokesman, confirmed that a team has been formed to help the families with funeral arrangements.
