BEFORE the democratic elections, the original gravestone of Hector Pieterson used to have an inscription that read “One Azania, One Nation”. Then the grave was mysteriously violated in the 1990s and a Good Samaritan donated a new headstone, but it did not have the words “Azania” or “Black Power”. Speaking to Daily Sun, Azapo president Strike Thokoane said they knew the grave was deliberately damaged. “The name Azania on the grave was a problem to some political organisations who are apologetic about changing the country’s name,” he said. Azapo will be at the Avalon Cemetery on Sunday to commemorate June 16. Thokoane said one day they will have the resources and the power of the state to rewrite the original words. “One day, God will give us the strength to rebuild the grave to its former glory,” he said. “Azapo will continue commemorating the day with dignity, without dance, jive and miniskirts.”
