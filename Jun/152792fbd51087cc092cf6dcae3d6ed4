MHALA cops in Thulamahashe hosted a debate session to mark the end of their Child Protection Week awareness campaign. The debate was held in Ludlow this week. Thirteen high schools from Agincourt and Manyeleti areas took part in the debate. The pupils debated topics such as gangsters, bullying, teenage pregnancy and substance abuse at schools. Kids from Mahlale High School were the overall winners. They excelled in all the topics. Panic Shai (17) said they were happy to win the debate. “After we had advanced from the preliminary stages, we conducted further research and came up with the best presentation,” Panic told Daily Sun. “We’d like to thank the police for organising the debate session. The topics form part of what we experience in our areas on a daily basis.” The junior station commander title went to Joy Ndzo (17). He said he will form a number of forums around the school. “I will ensure that we tackle some of the social challenges we face in our area,” he told the People’s Paper. Colonel John Ngwenya said: “The awareness is held annually during Child Protection Week, and schools in the villages are being grouped together to debate social challenges which affect them. “Our job as the police is to help our kids come up with solutions to challenges that we face in society. “To the pupils who didn’t win, next year the stage will be open again. “You have to start planning now.”
