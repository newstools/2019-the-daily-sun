OVER 50 members of the South African Domestic Service and Allied Union Workers gathered outside parliament yesterday demanding laws to protect them. One of their demands was that domestic workers should be covered by, and benefit from, the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act. They also demanded pensions and a R3 500 minimum wage. President Hesten Stephens said: “We are treated as if we don’t contribute to the economy.” David Esau from the department of labour accepted the memorandum on behalf of Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi, who is currently overseas. They marched from Sammy Marks Square to the Union Buildings yesterday. Secretary of the domestic workers group, Phumzile Skhosana, said domestic workers didn’t have benefits as they worked on public holidays and weekends without getting overtime pay. She said they also wanted foreigners to be part of the fight.
