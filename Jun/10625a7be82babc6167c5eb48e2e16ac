SCHOOLING stopped after a teacher was shot on the school premises yesterday. A witness said head of department Sibonakaliso Nyawose (48) arrived at Masuku Primary School in Folweni, south of Durban, at about 9am. “He parked near the main block and walked towards the passage. An unknown man entered the school and followed him into the passage. Then I heard gun shots.” The witness said the shooter left the schoolyard and got away in a car parked outside the school yard. Nyawose’s brother Muzi Magwaza (44) had no idea why he was killed. “He never hinted that his life was in danger,” said Muzi. He said Nyawose had been a teacher for more than 20 years and lived in Amanzimtoti. KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said: “I wish to send heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Nyawose.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of murder had been opened for investigation at Folweni cop shop. “It is alleged that yesterday at 9am a 48-year-old man was shot and killed at Masuku Primary School by an unknown suspect. The victim was declared dead at the scene. The circumstances are being investigated,” said Mbele. Education spokesman Kwazi Mshengu said the Department will send its district officials to assess the situation. Cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of assault with grievous bodily intent is being investigated by Mpumalanga Police.
