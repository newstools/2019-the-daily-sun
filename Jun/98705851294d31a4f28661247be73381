Musician, Naak Musiq triggered the 'body beef' again between rapper Cassper Nyovest and producer Prince Kaybee. READ: BODY GOALS CAUSE BEEF! This is after Naak Musiq tweeted a picture of himself flexing his muscles asking twitter users if everyone who posts their arms is competing with Nyovest and Prince Kaybee. "So does everyone who posts their arms now competing with Cassper and Prince Kaybee? We've been posting for a while now please give is a break," he wrote. Cassper replied saying it's no competition followed by a spicy remark directed to Prince Kaybee. "You're right my dude. It's not a competition. You have been training for years too. That bad bad called Princess Kaybee is the one who made it a competition talking about how he has bigger arms when he uses apps to make his waist smaller like a typical bad bad. Stupid!," Nyovest responded. Price Kaybee then replied to Cassper's spicy tweet by referring to him as Brazilian retired professional footballer, Roberto Carlos. This is because Carlos is extremely short. "Roberto Carlos mamela mo. I saw you running around a 5-a-side pitch. How about you get your best team, I get mine, pick a venue and we settle this? Ai o busy o buwa o le mong for two days now and rona re busy in studio," he said. But Cassper lashed his game proposal." "Roberto Carlos" declined "Princess Kaybee's" offer to play soccer: "Nah, there's nothing to settle and i don't wanna play soccer with niggas who wear fake Patek watches. I suggest you chill before i post the pictures of your fake iced out watch and its real price. O sogetse the wrong dude. I can be very petty," said Cassper. The back and forth between the two went on and on, see tweets below:
