NAMADZAVHO Makatu went to the hospital for her usual blood tests. And she went back home with a swollen, bleeding hand. Now the 39-year-old from Gondeni, outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, is angry. Namadzavho has accused the hospital of negligence. She said she had been going to Donald Fraser Hospital for almost two years without any problems. “These people are making my life miserable,” she said. “I went to the hospital seeking help but ended up going home in a worse condition. “I couldn’t get help, even from the hospital CEO.” Provincial health spokesman Neil Shikwambana said: “The patient visited the hospital but complained about a swelling after her hand was pricked. “She went back to the hospital, where she was helped. “As a department, we cannot find any link between the swelling hand and the prick.”
