THE beef between Gauteng’s Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile and Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba sets to intensify after the MEC accused Mashaba of enriching his wife through alleged corruption. For weeks the two have had words for each other since homes were destroyed by Red Ants in Alex, which the MEC said was the city’s fault. Allegations of corruption in the Alexandra Renewal Project (ARP) are the latest in the war of words between the two officials. The Citizen reports that this morning, Maile tweeted Mashaba saying: “@HermanMashaba Is your wife a shareholder at Phatsima the subsidiary of Growthpoint that does work with the City of Jhb? If so; do you know that this is corruption?”    Mashaba dismissed the tweet saying : “I unfortunately I don’t have any experience treating mental challenges. I would suggest you ask for someone’s else’s intervention.”   Phatsima properties is a subsidiary of Growthpoint properties, which does work with the city, reports the paper. According to the paper, Mashaba’s link to Phatsima was before his appointment as mayor and that he has since stated that he had cut ties with Growthpoint. The mayor reportedly once had a 40% indirect beneficial interest in Phatsima through the Herman and Connie Mashaba Trust. Maile maintains the allegations that the ARP funds had been misused more than a decade ago were made without a shred of evidence. His name has been earmarked for alleged corruption regarding the R1.3 billion renewal project, has denied any corruption saying at a press conference recently that every cent could be accounted for. This after Mashaba pointed to Maile, among others, as a factor that may have contributed to the lack of service delivery in Alexandra. Maile then said Mashaba was using the Alex project as an excuse for the lack of service delivery in the embattled township.
