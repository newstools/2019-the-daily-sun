CHIPPA United have handed coach Clinton Larsen a new two year contract after he helped guide the Chilli Boys to safety in 2018-19. Larsen was on a short team deal with Chippa but always said he would consider a new contract should the club avoid relegation to the National First Division (NFD). As such, with United finishing safely in 12th spot in the previous campaign, the 48-year-old will now continue his career in Port Elizabeth. Chairman Chippa Mpengesi revealed that the team have big ambitions under Larsen in 2019-20. He said: “His mandate is to ensure that the boys finish among the top eight in the upcoming season. “Clinton is a valued member of the Chippa United family and he has a good team to manage.” Meanwhile, veteran winger Daine Klate is reportedly being considered as an assistant coach to the former Orlando Pirates player. Also Eric Tinkler and his assistant Vincent Kobola have extended their contracts with Maritzburg United for a further three years. – SPORT24
