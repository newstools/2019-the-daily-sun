Winter is the season for neutral colours and Camel has been making a huge statement for the perfect winter colour. This desert, sand colour is a light beige. It looks super clean, classy, time-less and elegant. Camel has been quite popular in previous years with the famous camel statement coat, but wearing the colour camel, has now hit the fashion scene in other clothing items. Camel is easy to wear and it's easy to blend with other colours. See pictures below of some camel pieces: @tone_attire with the figure hugging dresses. ????
