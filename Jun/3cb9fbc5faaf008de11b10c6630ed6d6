NATIONAL First Division outfit Maccabi FC are up for sale! Maccabi owner Allan Norman confirmed to SunSport yesterday that he has decided to put up the “FOR SALE” sign on their door step, and had already received calls of interest from potential buyers. “It is not easy running a football club without having sponsorship,” he said. “I have got some calls from people who are interested in buying this club. But no one has made an official offer, so far. So things are still the same and we are continuing as normal. But we are ready to listen to anyone who is interested. I am expecting something tangible in the coming weeks.” Under the former Absa Premiership side Black Leopards head coach Joel Masutha, Maccabi ended last season in 11th spot. It was also Maccabi’s debut season in the NFD. Norman, whose club have players like PSL and Kaizer Chiefs legend Collins Mbesuma, did not want to reveal the names of potential buyers who have contacted him. But SunSport understands that Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi is one of the front-runners to buy the Dobsonville-based side. It is apparent that Lesufi wants to buy Maccabi and resurrect the former Soweto giants Moroka Swallows. The Dube Birds were relegated from the top flight in 2014-15 season. And now Swallows are playing in the ABC Motsepe League and it seems the best way to resuscitate the team is through buying a NFD status. Other people apparently interested in buying Maccabi are owner of North West based side Buya Msuthu. Msuthu play in the NW ABC Motsepe region. Mbombela United are another NFD side, who are reported to be up for sale Owner Oupa Mathebula told the media that he is selling because of corruption in the NFD.
