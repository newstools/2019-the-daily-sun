THE Limpopo mum whose young children died after they were hanged by their father is not coping. Lucia Mathepe was too distraught to speak to Daily Sun after the bodies of her two daughters, Annah (8) and Mary (5), were found hanging from the rafters of their 38-year-old father Samuel Kgatle’s home. Samuel later hanged himself. Lucia’s brother Ngoako Mathepe said his sister had not stopped crying since the tragic death of her daughters. “Yesterday at the mortuary, when she had to identify the children, she broke down in tears. We try to avoid speaking about the tragedy when we speak to her,” Ngoako said. The girls were visiting their dad at Ngaleng Village, outside Mankweng, for the school holidays when the incident happened on Saturday night. Earlier, Samuel had had an argument with his ex after he allegedly saw her with another man during a video call. Limpopo Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoale yesterday visited the bereaved families to help them deal with the pain. Rakgoale called on men not to take out their anger on children. She encouraged people to seek professional help when facing difficult times. She urged both families to be strong as what had happened could not be changed. “I have established a task team to assist with funeral arrangements so we can bury the dead with dignity,” she said.
