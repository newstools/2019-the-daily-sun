National First Division outfit TS Galaxy have secured the services of Botswana International goalkeeper Ezekiel Morake. The Rockets are expected to have a number of their Nedbank Cup winning players approached by PSL sides and have moved swiftly to bolster their squad for next season. The 23-year-old, who is currently on international duty with his national team in his maiden Cosafa Cup, joins the Mpumalanga side from Jwaneng Galaxy who play in the Botswana Premier League. South African fans will already have an idea of Morake’s capabilities having helped the Zebras dump Bafana Bafana out of the ongoing Cosafa Cup. “We are pleased to announce the signing of Botswana international goalkeeper Ezekiel “Zakes” Morake,” the club confirmed. “Zakes was instrumental in the elimination of South Africa yesterday when he made a superb save of Tebogo Mokoena’s penalty. He has several individual awards in the Botswana Premier League.”
