THE mood was sombre and the air thick with grief as Thami Tebela was laid to rest. His funeral service was held at his home in Block X, Soshanguve, north of Tshwane, on Saturday. The 35-year-old was found beaten and burned in Soshanguve a week ago. He died in hospital. Daily Sun published his story on Friday with the headline: “Driver’s family want killer bust.” Thami’s sister, Brenda (30), said he was employed as a taxi driver four weeks ago and was supposed to fix the taxi he was using, but it got stolen. “After a day, my brother was found beaten and burnt,” Brenda said. Police spokeswoman Captain Rheineth Motlana said a case of murder was opened, but no arrests have been made. Thami’s wife Tshepang said she was devastated. “He was a hard worker and he loved his family. We will remember him,” she said. She said she wanted those responsible for her husband’s murder arrested. Church representative Tokologo Menyatswe said they were hurt by his sudden death. “We are deeply hurt. Thami was very useful and respectful. “He took care of us and was very handy,” he said. Many speakers described Thami as business-minded. “He had a dream. All he thought about was making money,” said one speaker. Thami was buried at Klipgat Cemetery.
