FORMER president Jacob Zumaâ€™s son Duduzane Zuma will be
appearing in the Randburg Magistrate's Court. He is a step closer to knowing his destiny on the culpable
homicide charge. Zuma Porsche 911 Turbo crashed into a taxi in 2014, killing Phumzile
Dube. The Court is expected to hear closing arguments in the case. Zuma previously told the court he is not guilty of culpable
homicide. He said his car twisted and hit an "object" and he
did not recall what exactly the object was. Zuma also told the court that it had been impossible for him
to bring the car back under control following the crash.
