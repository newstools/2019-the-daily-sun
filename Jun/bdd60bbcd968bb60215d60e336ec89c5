THE family of a school principal who was shot 17 times is praying for his fast recovery. The man from KwaMashu, Durban, is fighting for his life in hospital after escaping death on 29 May. He was driving on Barracuda Drive in Newlands East when a car overtook him. One of the three men in the car allegedly fired several shots, wounding the principal. A member of his family said they were waiting for him to recover so they could find out what really happened. The man’s sister told Daily Sun: “I don’t want to talk about the matter while he is still in hospital. “We will only know what really happened once he has recovered.” KZN cops spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. He said the motive for the shooting was unknown at this stage. “The matter is still under investigation.”
