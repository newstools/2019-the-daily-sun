LOCAL businesswoman Nosizwe Nyathi is opening her heart and her wallet to help children in her area. On Tuesday, the co-founder of Shamila Trading Enterprise, in partnership with Mhala police, donated school uniforms and bags to pupils at Thulamahashe schools. Nyathi told the school children her business believed in giving back to the community and through their partnership with the police, the donation would assist children from families in need. “We want our kids to attend school well-clothed, and we plan to continue this contribution to our residents. “This is also to show our clients we share whatever we make in the business with our community,” Nyathi said. “Our plan in future is to scout for grade 11 and 12 pupils who are doing well and to help them study after matric. “We also want to help them find employment.” She said they wanted to kickstart the process by going to schools in Mhala’s policing areas. Sergeant Abigail Nxumalo said they appreciated being the official partners in the programme to give back to needy community members in their area.
