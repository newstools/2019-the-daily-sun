  Bipolar is the sixth leading cause of disability in the world. Over one million Mzansi people suffer from this medical issue that
requires treatment and support, something that many lack. Men and women are equally affected, but men tend to have more hectic
episodes while women experience more depressive episodes. Doctors say patients need guidance and support in understanding what
their diagnosis of bipolar means and what their treatment entails, as well as
what medication they will be taking and why. Bipolar (previously called manic-depression) affects about 2% of the
population. Sufferers swing between depression, loss of interest in normal
activities, loss of energy, inability to concentrate, and suicidal thoughts
right through to irritation. They also experience extremely elevated moods, feeling invincible, an
inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, and racing thoughts and speech. The change in mood can be experienced by those around the sufferer.  What can families and friends do to help?   Contact Sadag by calling 080 021 2223 or SMSing 31393. The line is open from 8am to
