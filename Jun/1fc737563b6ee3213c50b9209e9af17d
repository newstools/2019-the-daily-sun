PARENTS of pupils at Vuluhlanga High School in Butterworth are planning a mass meeting with pupils in a bid to curb violent occurrences. Last week grade 11 pupil Sibulele Mkhwelo (18) was stabbed with a stainless steel spoon at the school by his cousin Qhamani Mahobo (19) after the pupils had just had their lunch. Parents are still shocked by the incident. SGB vice chairman Mathombela Maciko said the school is one of the best performing schools in the area, with an average matric pass rate of over 75% for the past five years. “Whether the children were playing or not, we don’t want it to happen again,” said Maciko. “The law will take its course. We will call a meeting with all the pupils including the two and talk this through,” he said. The school principal said he visited Mkhwele in hospital on Monday and he is in a good condition and maintains that they were just playing. He said they had to give the pupils counselling. “It is the policy of the department that we cannot deprive the accused pupil of his right to education. We have to wait until the court decides,” said principal Xolani Koko. “There were no indications that this would happen.” Meanwhile, cops spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha confirmed Mahobo appeared in court on Monday “The case was postponed to 26 June. The suspect was released on warning,” he said.
