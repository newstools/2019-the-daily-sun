Busisiwe Xaba bagged her first big role as Palesa on SABC1’s Generations: The Legacy. Her love of acting began when she was growing up in a very big family. She said every day they prayed at 7pm. She’d gather her cousins and put a play together to entertain the elders before each prayer. Palesa, a tertiary graduate, is looking for work. She lives with her sister Lerato, played by Candice Modiselle, and her alcoholic mum who’s in debt, and wants to do whatever she can to ensure her sister has a good life. Like any young graduate, there are fewer opportunities and she’s struggling to get by, especially without any work experience. Busisiwe (27) said being part of the soapie feels like a dream. It takes her back to when she was young, sitting on her grandmother’s couch watching the soapie. Busisiwe said now that she’s part of the cast, there are a lot of veterans she looks up to and who helped her get on her feet. “I now have an opportunity to influence eight million viewers. What a voice to suddenly have. I’m grateful for the opportunity,” she said. The actress from Winchester Hills, south of Joburg, said she’s familiar with desperation to a certain degree, as well as feeling as if you have no idea what your purpose in life is. “Palesa may be vulnerable, but I love the fact that she’s also ambitious and hard-working. I share the sentiment. She wants to make it in life. “I approach this role with the understanding a lot of people are experiencing the same thing. “I also relate to her story because I had to drop out in third year at varsity because I needed money. “There’s a lot on her plate, but her choice? I’m not sure I can do what she does.” Busisiwe wants to focus on her ministry and use this opportunity to reach out to young people.
