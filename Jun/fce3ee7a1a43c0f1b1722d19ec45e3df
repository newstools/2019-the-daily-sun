“STOP the carnage!” This was the message Police Minister Bheki Cele had for those responsible for burning trucks, especially in KZN. Cele, Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula and Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi addressed the media at the KZN police headquarters. Cele said: “We are not intimidating anybody, but the police will do their work because we can’t negotiate over the crimes that have been committed. Of course, we will make sure the law takes its course.” Premier Sihle Zikalala said they came up with a plan with the departments and would work on it together. “We have established a rapid response team that will ensure there are enough police on the ground. Cases of truck torching will be followed thoroughly and prosecutions will happen,” he said. Positive Freight Solutions spokeswoman Priya Hassan said they would not tolerate attacks on their drivers and property. “We are committed to working with all the relevant stakeholders to ensure stability,” she said. Hassan called for police visibility in all the hot spots they had identified. National Truck Driver Foundation spokesman Bheki Biyela said they wanted to distance themselves from the arson attacks. “At no point will we ever issue instructions to do these things,” he said. At the briefing, it emerged that over 60 trucks were recently torched and there had been 91 arrests so far.
