MORE than 800 men from various men’s forums in Bushbuckridge said they’ve had enough of the high rate of women and child abuse in the area. They held an indaba at Christ is the Gospel Church in Cottondale, outside Acornhoek in Mpumalanga, on Thursday. They were joined by police, churches and officials from various departments. MMC for social development Krisjan Mokoena said: “We established the Bushbuckridge Men’s Forum in 2016. Our aim was to teach every man to love and respect women and children so we can reduce crime.” Daniel Mathebula, co-ordinator of the Okkernotboom Men’s Forum, said: “Men need each other. Our forum has 520 members, 400 women in the women’s forum, and 172 members in the senior citizens’ forum, as well as 72 members in boys’ forum and 56 members in girls’ forum. We’ll soon launch a widows’ forum.” He said people in the area were poor and faced many social ills. “Men in society are no longer respected and trusted as a result of a few people who are involved in immoral activities such as rape, not paying maintenance, divorce, mashonisa, gender-based violence and spreading HIV/Aids. Our vision is to restore our dignity in society,” said Mathebula. Bushbuckridge Men Sector’s chairman Kgahliso Mashego said: “Men now know their role in families. We’ll soon have a sitting in district and provincial government and parliament.”
