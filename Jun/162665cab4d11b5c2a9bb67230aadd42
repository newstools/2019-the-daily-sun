“This is more like the Bafana Bafana we have become used to in recent years.” That is the message from some Bafana Bafana fans after watching their national men’s team fall to yet another defeat. Bafana were beaten 1-0 by Ivory Coast in their opening Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) match on Monday at the Al Salam Stadium in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. They languish at the bottom of Group A behind the Elephants, Morrocco and their next opponents Namibia in the early stages of the tournament. The defeat to the Ivorians left a feeling that has become all too familiar for Bafana fans. They have flattered to deceive on many occasions in the past, hence their love hate relationship with their fans. SunSport spoke to a few Bafana fans to get their sentiments following the results. Mthokozisi Ndlovu (34) from Soweto, said: “That game was very disappointing for us fans to watch, we couldn’t understand what the coach was trying to do. “I think the coach is not utilising Percy Tau in the right way. He is always forced to go back and fetch the ball, which makes him useless in attack." However, not everyone has completely lost confidence in Bafana. Afteral, they could still redeem themselves in their last two matches of the tournament. Their next encounter against the Brave Warriors of Namibia will take place at the same venue on Friday (10pm) while the last game against the Atlas Lions will take place three days later. “I think Bafana can still progress to the next round,” said Scelo Ndlovu from Soweto. “People must not be quick to lose hope, this is our team and I think they need us to back them.”
