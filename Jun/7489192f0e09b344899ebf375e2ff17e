PROTEAS batsman David Miller has been ruled out of Friday's Iternational Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup clash against Sri Lanka with a groin strain. The 30-year-old picked up the injury while fielding in Sunday’s 49-run loss to Pakistan at Lord’s. He left the field at the time, but did return to bat as South Africa posted 259/9 in their unsuccessful run chase. Miller, batting with his injury, was out for 31 off 37 as South Africa fell to a defeat that mathematically knocked them out of the tournament. In Miller’s absence today, the Proteas will turn to JP Duminy. The 35-year-old has not played since the loss to India at the Rose Bowl back on 5 June. In what has been a disappointing tournament for the elegant left-hander, Duminy has posted scores of 8, 45 and 3 in this, his third World Cup. Duminy has already announced that he will retire from ODI cricket at the conclusion of the tournament. Play starts at 11.30am (SA time).
