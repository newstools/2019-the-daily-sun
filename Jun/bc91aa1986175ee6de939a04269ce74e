He is a legal official who accuses people of committing a
crime - only this time, he is the one accused of a crime. A 44-year-old District Public Prosecutor from the Family
Court in Joburg was arrested on Tuesday for alleged corruption and extortion. He was bust by the Gauteng Police Anti-Corruption Unit. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the suspect was
in possession of the money at the time of his arrest. “The victim alleged that he received a call from the man who
identified himself as the prosecutor who dealt with his case in court. “The caller informed him that if he gave him R10 000, he would
cancel his case and give him the docket to ensure that no case will be opened
against him,” said Masondo. He said the matter was reported to the police and an
operation was initiated. “The police pounced on the District Prosecutor at the
Johannesburg Family Court after he accepted R5000 from the complainant,” added
Masondo. The suspect is expected to appear at the Johannesburg
Magistrate Court on Thursday.
