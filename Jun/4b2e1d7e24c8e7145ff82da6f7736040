The ANC Gauteng deputy chairman and Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is a brilliant politician. Lesufi’s also a charismatic and excellent communicator. He’s a darling of the media, and is always in the right place at the right time. He is tipped as the future minister of education, if not premier of Gauteng. Three years ago, Lesufi introduced the online application system for admission to grades 1 and 8 and discarded the traditional system. The intention is to extend the online system to other grades in future. Many viewed this move as a step in the right direction. But is it? When the online applications opened, there were serious technical problems, which the media chose to refer to as minor glitches. Lesufi, who is always visible, was nowhere to be found. On the first day and days after the opening, many users struggled to log on. After applying online, parents had to go to the five schools they had applied at to deliver the necessary documents. And many were not aware they had to deliver the documents to schools. What an inconvenience! The pertinent question is, why is there no option to upload the documents online? What was the point of introducing the system, then? The department is behaving as if it’s running a spaza shop. Parents have to struggle with the online system and then run around like headless chickens delivering documents. Another challenge is that the system has no edit option. If the user makes a mistake, they cannot rectify it. This really does not make any sense. Remember, this system has been running for three years now. My concern is that these problems are known to the department, yet nothing is being done to rectify them. It’s a week now since the applications for admission have been open yet the problems are still there. Does the department of education take us seriously? ) Thabile Mange
