TRADITIONAL leaders in KZN are asking for housing subsidies and car allowances. That was what House of Traditional Leaders chairman Phathisizwe Chiliza told traditional affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka in Durban yesterday. At the new MEC’s first meeting with all 295 chiefs, Chiliza said amakhosi lived in collapsing houses and had no cars. He urged Hlomuka to tell the cabinet they needed to live in decent houses in line with their status. He said government needed to ensure they had cars to do their work, and attend meetings with MECs. “We want you to know there are amakhosi here who had to get lifts to attend this meeting because they don’t have money to buy cars. “Some are forced to ask their poor people to buy them cars. “This is a problem because people in rural areas are not working.” Chiliza said aging amakhosi should be given drivers paid for by the government, and the payment of izinduna needed to be organised. He said izinduna and traditional court clerks were the backbone of amakhosi, so government needed to look after them. The MEC urged the chiefs to be calm because the country’s economy was bad. He said there were things the government wanted to do but it couldn’t happen overnight. He promised to look into all the issues raised.
