ACCORDING to Home Affairs, gogo Mjaji Ngobeni gave birth to her first child when she was nine years old! Although the gogo from Qaza Village in Limpopo was born in 1953, her ID shows she was born in 1963. Her daughter was born in 1972 – and her ID confirms that. Mjaji said she had been to Home Affairs several times to try to fix the mistake but in vain. “I went to their offices in Malamulele and Makwarela several times to submit my documents, including my dompas and a letter from the traditional authority. But they sent me home without helping me,” she said. Because of the mistake, she is not yet due for a social grant. Mjaji said she was tired of going to Home Affairs. “I think of killing myself because no one wants to help me. My only son, who was taking care of me financially, is no longer working,” she said. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter was referred to its provincial offices for investigation. “The manager will delegate officials to contact the client to help resolve the issue,” he said.
