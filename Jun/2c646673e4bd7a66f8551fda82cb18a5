COPS have warned commuters to be careful of taxi thugs. Benoni police spokeswoman Captain Nomsa Sekele said they were looking for three or four occupants of a white Quantum who have been robbing people in the area. She said a case was opened on 29 May after a woman was robbed in a taxi she boarded on 2nd Street, Northmead at about 4.20pm. “As they continued driving, the woman suspected something was wrong and immediately asked to be dropped off. The taxi didn’t stop and one of the men slapped her and ordered her to lie down. She was assaulted and her handbag was taken.” She said the suspects asked the woman for her bank pin and one of them jumped out of the vehicle. After they realised her account didn’t have any money in it, they forced her to call her mum to transfer cash into her account. “The victim did as she was told and asked her mum to give money to her sister who was waiting for her at Heidelberg Road. “They went there, took the money from her sister, drove off with her and dropped her off in an unknown location.”
