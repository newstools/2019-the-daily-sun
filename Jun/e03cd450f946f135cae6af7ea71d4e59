Uber will ban passengers will low ratings, the company announced this week. If you're a passenger who habitually leaves their trash behind and disrespect drivers you may soon get the boot. The company did not say what minimum riders would need to meet or what infractions might ding them the most. "Riders may lose access to Uber if they develop a significantly below average rating. Riders will receive tips on how to improve their ratings, such as encouraging polite behavior, avoiding leaving trash in the vehicle and avoiding requests for drivers to exceed the speed limit. Riders will have several opportunities to improve their rating prior to losing access to the Uber apps.Respect is a two-way street, and so is accountability. Drivers have long been expected to meet a minimum rating threshold which can vary city to city. While we expect only a small number of riders to ultimately be impacted by ratings-based deactivations, itâ€™s the right thing to do." Uber said in a statement. Uber said that errant passengers would be banned for life.
