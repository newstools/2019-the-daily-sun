IT was a job for him just like any other. But little did Simon Mabaso (63) know it would create enemies. This came after he was paid by magoshas to protect them as they visited a squatter camp to service their clients. But he just escaped death last Thursday when petrol was poured on his house. Mabaso, from Denver Squatter Camp in Joburg, used another door to escape. He said he heard men’s voices at about 1am and one of them said: “Mayife lenja.” It was followed by breaking glass, people pouring petrol and throwing a match stick, and an explosion. “I woke my tenants and we ran out,” he said. Although nobody died, about 67 shacks were burnt to the ground. Resident Joel Mafaisa said some people weren’t happy about mkhulu’s job and felt he was promoting prostitution in the squatter camp. “He did nothing wrong – we felt safe when he was around,” a magosha said. Local shops and Joburg Disaster Management came to the rescue of the affected victims whose mkhukhus were burnt down. A case of arson was opened at Cleveland Police Station. Five other shacks burned down but luckily no one was injured.
