THE annual Maimane Alfred Phiri (MAP) games swung back into action this weekend to again serve up a good brand of kasi football. Having set the standard very high over the past 18 years, founder of the popular kasi winter tournament, Maimane Alfred Phiri, has promised to raise the bar even higher with this year’s edition. Hundreds of diski fans from across the country will descend to Alexandra, affectionately known as “Gomora”, north of Joburg, to witness local football at its best. In the past, the tourney has produced top Premier Soccer League and international stars. The same is expected from this year’s edition, where scouts and player agents will be on the lookout for talent. “We expect fireworks again this year,” said Phiri, who was a member of the Bafana Bafana 1998 Fifa World Cup team. “As always, we’re hoping to dish out good kasi football. Scouts will be there to spot the best talent. It’s a good platform for players to showcase their talent.” The tournament’s seniors’ play-offs kicked off yesterday at the Rotary A grounds, Corner 5th Avenue and Roosevelt in Alex, with eight teams battling it out for a slot in the last 32. Today’s action resumes with Peace Makers and Nongoma United opening the day’s proceedings at 9am. That clash will be followed by Amarambaramba taking on DRA at 11am, while Limpopo City face Nobuhle United at 1pm. Sneke Chillas will lock horns with Lebash to close off the day’s action at 3pm. The winners of this round will proceed to the last 32 with the final of the tournament scheduled for 22 July.
