MLUNGISI Mathe said there’s more to him than acting. The 28-year-old actor who rose to fame as Emkay on the SABC1 soapie Skeem Saam goes by the stage name of Skandi Kid. He told SunBuzz: “People were surprised to learn I was a singer as they only knew me as an actor. Now they see I’m multitalented and will always surprise them. “I might even introduce myself as a dancer, so people must look out.” Skandi Kid said he wants to be known as the coolest kid ever to do maskandi. He studied theatre at the Market Theatre Laboratory. He was lucky to be recognised by one of Skeem Saam’s casting directors just after he graduated in 2015. “Theatre was all I loved, so when the offer to be in a soapie came, I almost didn’t take it, but I’m glad I did.” Skandi Kid released his debut album Ulizwi in 2017. His popular singles Do You Remember and Nonduduzo were released last year. His fans can catch him performing on Saturday at 1936 Endaweni Lounge at Kanana extension 4 in Rabie Ridge, near Midrand. Entry is R30.
