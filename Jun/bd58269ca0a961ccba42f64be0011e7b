ALL madala Petrus Magagula wanted was a house. And now, after 13 years of waiting, Petrus (79) finally received his RDP house on Monday. He was given the keys to his house in Rockdale, Middelburg, Mpumalanga, by officials from the Steve Tshwete Municipality. On 2 August last year, Daily Sun published an article, titled I Just Want My House, where he voiced his frustrations. He claimed he had become the laughing stock of municipal workers when he demanded answers about his house. He alleged that his house was given to someone else while he was away to be an undercover soldier during the apartheid era. Now, he said he was happy to finally own a house after years of struggle. The father of two said he would die a happy man after getting what he had wanted for many years. “I am so grateful to finally have what’s mine,” he said. “I will sleep very well knowing that I have my own house after struggling. “Even if I die today, I will die a happy man. “ My children will have a place to call home. “I am so happy. “I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the People’s Paper for assisting me.”
