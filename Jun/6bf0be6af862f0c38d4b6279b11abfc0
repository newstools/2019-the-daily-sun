A Metro police became an instant midwife and delivered
a healthy baby. On Wednesday, Officer Lebogang Mngomezulu helped a
28-year-old woman give birth on the side of the road. This was after a passer-by saw the woman laying down
on the pavement at the intersection of Eloff and Village Road Selby in Joburg
CBD. Mngomezulu was alerted and she rushed to investigate. According to the JMPD spokesman, Wayne Minaar the
pregnant woman was going into labour right at the moment. He said: "The officer helped to deliver the baby
and wrapped the new-born baby girl with her jacket. "Thereafter, she rushed to the Joburg Central
fire station and came back with a paramedic who helped to cut the umbilical
cord," said Wayne. Both the mother and the baby were taken to Hillbrow
Clinic and are said to be doing well.
