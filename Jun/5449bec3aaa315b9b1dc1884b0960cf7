IT’S been more than four days since miners have been trapped underground. Numsa members embarked on a sit-in at Lanxess mine in Bleskop, outside Rustenburg, North West yesterday. They claim management doesn’t treat them fairly and vowed to strike until their demands are met. Mine spokeswoman Nomzamo Khanyile said the ongoing strike was declared illegal by a Joburg court. “Our main focus is on resolving the situation quickly and safely without any violence and bringing all employees back to the surface, well and safe. To our knowledge the situation is calm and we are not aware of any violence or shooting.” She also confirmed a list of demands was handed over to management. The demands include a sexual harassment case dating back to October. She said the case is already under investigation by an independent investigator. Numsa’s Hlanganani region secretary Jerry Morulane said: “There was progress made at a meeting with management over the weekend. In the issue relating to sexual harassment it was resolved that the culprit will be suspended and investigations will be done.” Morulane said the issue of the 50 Numsa dismissed employees is yet to be discussed. He said they were dismissed because the union was gaining traction in the mine. But there is no certainty as to when miners will finally come to the surface.
