CAPE Town City have confirmed the singing of Orlando Pirates defender Abbubaker Mobara. Mobara, who spent three difficult years with the Buccaneers as he struggled to break into the team, joins the Citizens on a four-year deal. The former Ajax Cape Town star is hoping to revive his career under Benni McCarthy. “To come back here and play in the Mother City is a warm feeling, a wonderful feeling, I see home, and that’s the feeling where the heart is. The heart wants to be home,” Mobara said in a video posted by City on social media. “It’s a family team, it’s one and that’s the feeling I want to gain back. The feeling of happiness is important. “I really want to prove myself and not to the rest of the world, but to myself that I am worthy of being in a beautiful team like this. I see the team is doing well for itself and I see how happy the players."
