WITHOUT an ID, Babalwa Nyangindlela (25) can’t function. And for the last two years since she applied for one at Mankwe Home Affairs in Mogwase, outside Rustenburg in North West, she’s been sitting around doing nothing. She was told she would receive an SMS but it never came. At the end of 2017 when her mum Mandisa went to enquire about the ID, an official said he wanted an affidavit from her home town in the Eastern Cape, which they provided. They were told the system didn’t identify Babalwa as Mandisa’s child. Babalwa’s been visiting the institution every month. “I can’t work or go to school. Home Affairs is keeping me chained at home,” she said. Mankwe Home Affairs supervisor Belinda Kgatla said Babalwa’s grandfather applied for her birth certificate while her mum applied for the ID. The system sees her as her grandfather’s child. She said they had sent her details to head office so a new application process can be started. Kgatla said there should be progress next week.
