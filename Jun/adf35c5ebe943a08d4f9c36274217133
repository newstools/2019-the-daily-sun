HE might be physically small, but he has a big heart. A good one, too! All Bongani Mahlangu needs is someone to love him. He is ready to love again – eight years after losing his girlfriend and mother of his son (17). Bongani (37), a taxi marshal from Mandela Village, near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, has the physique of a 10-year-old boy. He said he had tried to find the right woman but nothing worked out for him. He said he had met playful women who didn’t know what they wanted. “My heart has been broken many times, but I am ready to love again. After the mum of my son died in 2011, I was heartbroken. “I tried to find love, but never met a good woman. I should not be judged by my body because I have a good heart. My dream is to settle down like other men,” he said. He said he loved his job as it puts food on the table.
