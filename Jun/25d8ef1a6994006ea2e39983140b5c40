CASH-IN-TRANSIT robbery suspects were bust on Friday after their car crashed. The Audi S5 slammed into a house in Sebokeng in the Vaal, injuring the suspects. Colonel Brenda Muridili said a chase took place after a shoot-out between the suspects and the police. “Seven suspects were arrested. One man died after the vehicle caught fire after crashing. “Two suspects were taken to hospital under police guard,” she said. It happened after the thugs unsuccessfully tried to rob a cash-in-transit van at Evaton Mall. Muridili said: “A team made up of different police agencies, including Joburg Metro police, spotted five vehicles with false registration number plates”. She said two R5 rifles and three magazines were recovered. Cops also confiscated a BMW X1, a VW kombi and VW Vivo, a Fiat bakkie, a Tata Indica, as well as the burnt-out Audi. Police commissioner General Khehla Sitole praised the cops who made the arrests. “I am pleased that members continue to stop these evil crimes and bring perpetrators to book. “We are making great strides in these crimes,” he said. Police were still searching for five suspects and urged people to pass on any information about their whereabouts to Crime Stop on 08600 10111.
