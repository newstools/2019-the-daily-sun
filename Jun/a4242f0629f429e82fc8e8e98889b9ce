The Exodus of ANC MP's from the 6th Parliament continued on Tuesday. Just a day after it was announced that veteran Members of Parliament Dr Siyabongwa Cwele and Jeff Radebe resigned as MPs, it was announced this morning that Bathabile Dlamini the ANC's Women's League Chairperson has also resigned.

Dlamini served as Minister of Social Development and until the new Parliament as Minister of Women in the Presidency. Bathabile Dlamini inclusion into the 6th Parliament was controversial.  The EFF and other political parties said that Dlamini being on ANC parliament list was a sign that there was no 'New Dawn'. In her resignations letter Dlamini said that "It is the greatest part of a life of all those that never had any home, of all those who participated in mass struggle, in student movements as well as underground structures of the movement but never blew their horn about their participation in the struggle" Bathabile Dlaminiâ€™s resignation letter had some interesting takeaways like the part where Dlamini says that she is waiting to see whether some NEC members will be fighting the present ANC leadership. "It is also worrisome that there are members in the NEC that have fought all the Presidents, from President Nelson Mandela, President Mbeki and President Jacob Zuma. I am waiting to see what they are planning for the present leadership," Dlamini said. Though her inclusion into the 6th Parliament was disputed, Dlamini stints as MP gave us some memorable moments. Here are some of them:
