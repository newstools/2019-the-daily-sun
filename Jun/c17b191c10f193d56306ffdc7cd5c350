THE drunken man who was saved from a fiery death by his peeing neighbour is getting help from SunReaders! On Wednesday, Daily Sun told the story of Monaheng Makhina (31) from Khayelitsha, Mangaung. His shack caught fire after he fell asleep over an open fire. Luckily, his brave neighbour Paseka Bruintjies (39) pulled him out of the burning shack. The fire left Monaheng homeless. But SunReaders got together to organise him a shack. Monaheng said when his shack burned down on Sunday, the owner of his local tavern gave him a place to stay for a few days. “Residents bought the zinc and built me a shack – that’s true ubuntu. Now I have my home again. This time I will be more careful and never repeat the same mistake.” “I also thank the People’s Paper that showed how I struggled.” Resident Monaheng Masoleng (46) said: “Some people bought building materials, others donated clothes, blankets and food. “Others gave back with their hands and their labour. “We understood and felt his pain at having nowhere to stay.”
