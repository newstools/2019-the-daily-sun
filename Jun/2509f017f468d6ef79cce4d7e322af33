BUSINESSMAN Calvin Mutwanamba feels part of Hayani Hospital in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. For more than 16 years, he has been helping mental care patients at the hospital. On Friday, he donated 100 blankets to the management of the hospital in the presence of the hospital board and mental care users. The handover was made during a function which was attended by members of Mphaphuli royal house, led by Chief Makwarela Makhuvha. Calvin, who runs Ditiro Tsaka Security Services, has sponsored almost every event at the hospital since 2001. Every year he celebrates his birthday with patients. He also sponsors the hospital’s family day. Calvin told Daily Sun the hospital had become his second home, and has developed a special relationship with patients and management. “Mental care users need our support. Many of them have been here for a long time, and some relatives have forgotten about them. They need our care and support.” Chief Makhuvha praised Calvin for helping the patients. Hospital acting CEO Robert Lavhelani thanked Mutwanamba for the generous gesture.
