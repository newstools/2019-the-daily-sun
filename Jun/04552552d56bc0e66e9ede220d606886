HE is still on a mission to have a positive impact on today’s generation. Itu Bochele (49) will present the Ga-Rankuwa Annual Biggest Show, known as Gabs, on Saturday. It combines entertainment and education to commemorate the sacrifices made by the youth of 1976. “This is our fifth celebration, and music lovers will love the sound,” the comedian and MC told SunBuzz. “Dancers will tap their feet and the show will stimulate their minds with kasi dialogue. “Our aim is to create social harmony by getting different generations to communicate and create meaningful discussion in a casual and informal setup.’’ The dialogue will be hosted by veteran broadcaster Tim Modise. “It will be based on the social problems that are part of our community – from drug abuse to domestic violence.” Oupa Makhubela’s Poy-Poy band, as well as Molo and Ntlaks, will perform. “They will remind the audience of the days when music was pure, delightful and soulful,” said Itu. “The Ga-Rankuwa Community Choir, which has regrouped after many years, will be taking the crowd down memory lane.” Comedians Sammy Fever, Thabang ER and Mdu Ntuli will perform, and DJ Clifford Phalatse and DJ Positive K will close the show. It will be held at Thabong Lodge in Ga-Rankuwa, and it starts at 3pm.
