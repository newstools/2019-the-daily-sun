Mpho Molepo wants to teach communities and schools about albinism. The actor, who’s better known as Fats in Rhythm City, has produced a play called Mama, I Want the Black That You Are. The play teaches pupils to love people with albinism the way they love themselves. “We are busy on a roadshow where we visit 10 schools in each province to perform the play,” he said. “We talk about the plight of people living with albinism.” He said there were questions and answers after the play. “Children cry after the play because of the hardships people with albinism go through.” Mpho said the play was launched at the Joburg Theatre in May last year.  “I have become an advocate for people with albinism. They are just like everyone else. This is genetic and no one is in charge of it. It is determined by God,” Mpho has been on Rhythm City for the past 12 years. He said he likes being on the soapie as it speaks to people’s souls and reflects the true life of people in kasi. Mpho, based in Joburg, owns Molepo Theatre Projects.
