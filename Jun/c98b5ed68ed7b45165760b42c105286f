ONCE again Babes Wodumo has failed to appear in court! She was supposed to appear at the Pinetown Magistrates Court with her boyfriend, kwaito star Mampintsha, yesterday to hear a mediation report after her case against him was referred to the Family and Marriage Association of South Africa. In March Babes opened an assault case against Mampintsha. The incident was captured on video. Asked by the magistrate why Babes was not in court, prosecutor Ndoda January said: “I think she has a stomach ache or something. I’m not sure, my Lord.” The court heard that the Famsa sessions did not take place. The social worker asked for three new sessions. Pillay said Mampintsha and Babes must attend each session. He also warned Babes to produce a medical report at her next appearance. KZN NPA spokeswoman Natasha Kara said it would be up to the magistrate to decide whether the case went to trial if Babes did not produce a medical report or failed to attend the Famsa sessions. The matter was postponed to 9 July.
