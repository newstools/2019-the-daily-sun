THE illegal breeding of pit bulls has become a major problem ekasi. Every month, the SPCA in Uitenhage, Nelson Mandela Bay, puts down more than 100 of these sometimes vicious dogs and Motherwell has also become a problem. Inspector Mariaan Wentzel of the Uitenhage SPCA said: “Every day we get complaints about pit bulls. “They attack people or other animals. “Motherwell has a problem with the illegal breeding of pit bulls. “People breed them with other dogs and they produce dogs that are dangerous and unruly. “A person is only allowed to breed dogs with municipal permission. “In a month, we put down about 150 of these dogs because of illegal breeding. “The owners surrender them because they are aggressive and we cannot reform them. “They sell them for R300 a puppy and people don’t know the temperament of their dogs because they’re not aware of what they are bred with.” She said people found illegally breeding dogs can face a huge sentence. “There is a fine of R50 000 for neglect or five years in prison for denial of ownership. We need communities to stand up and talk about illegal breeding and dog fights. “There is a reward of R30 000 for reporting suspicious activities and dog fighting. The information will be kept secret,” said Wentzel. She said people should report illegal breeding on 071 516 1517. However, Shaun Bosman (24) from Missionvale said there was nothing wrong with pit bulls. “My brother has one and it has been with us for two years. He is friendly to everybody, including visitors. “But he hates people wearing hoodies, hats or those who have dreadlocks,” said Shaun.
