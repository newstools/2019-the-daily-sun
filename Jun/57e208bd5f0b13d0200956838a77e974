DAGGA smokers still don’t have the courage to disclose their use of it – even though it has been decriminalised. What they do not know, however, is that omitting the truth about them using it can affect their long-term insurance claims. That’s why insurance giant Liberty encourages dagga users to come clean when it comes to underwriting. Liberty’s public relations specialist Xola Duze said when dagga users don’t telling the truth about their health when applying for insurance, this placed payment of their claims in jeopardy. The Constitutional Court decriminalised use and private cultivation of cannabis in September last year. Duze was speaking at an insurance advice seminar in Polokwane, Limpopo, yesterday. She said, given the negative stigma around cannabis, it was understandable why people were afraid to disclose using the ‘holy herb’. “However, when you enter into an agreement with an insurer, this is a contract based on confidential trust. Don’t be afraid to disclose your cannabis use – it is legal after all,” she said. Liberty chief medical officer, Dr Dominique Stott, said: “This is a relationship built on honesty, trust and full disclosure, even when it comes to the use of cannabis. “This is why we encourage advisers and clients to inform us of any medical or lifestyle events that would impact their application for a policy.” Full disclosure would not only help to reduce the occurrence of non-disclosure claims, it would also ensure that clients receive their payouts, Duze and Stott said.
