MASTER KG has bought himself a double-storey house! He took to Facebook last week to share the news. He said it had always been his dream to own such a property. The house is in Midrand, Gauteng. Master KG, whose real name is Kgaugelo Moagi (23), told Daily Sun he decided to make the announcement after his song Skeleton Move reached 10 million viewers on YouTube. “I decided to share the news with my fans because they showed me support through thick and thin. “They even supported me when I won the SABC Summer Song of the Year competition in January,” he said. Master KG, originally from Calais Village outside Tzaneen in Limpopo, said he was very proud of himself as he had been struggling to find proper accommodation. “I have been living in villages and it was my wish and dream to own such a big house. “I live alone right now, but I look forward to living with family members soon.” Master KG told the People’s Paper he was not surprised his hit Skeleton Move had so many views. Master KG and up-and-coming vocalist Makhadzi released a new song titled Tshikwama two weeks ago. “This is currently doing well and in the next two weeks we will be releasing a music video,” he said.
