AFRO singer Khulile said he is all about great music. The musician whose real name is Khulile Ntsetsha (29), from Uitenhage, Eastern Cape said he always makes sure to deliver a great sound. He told SunBuzz life events inspired him to write his lyrics. He said: “I grew up in a house filled with music, from jazz to gospel, as my parents were both in church choirs.” He released his first single titled Love Is All I Feel in March last year and worked with vocalist Zanele Khumalo on it. “It was well received and made the top 100 Afro chart on traxsource.com and played on various international radio stations and podcasts.” He said he would like to work with house producer and DJ Black Coffee. “He created two of my all-time favourite house tracks, 100 Zulu Warriors and Trip to Lyon, which I still play today whenever I’m behind the decks. Being able to be with him in studio would be a dream come true for me.” Khulile has shared the stage with DJ Fresh, DJ Euphonik, Ralf Gum and DJ Kent. “I had a chance to share the stage with Black Coffee at my friend’s annual In2Deep Freshe event. It was so great to be with the legend as we only see him on TV or far from us during social events,” said Khulile. The singer said he felt loved and appreciated by his fans. “I believe my talent is everything, not only to me, but also my fans. I want to be celebrated and I want to an inspiration to many,” said the singer.
