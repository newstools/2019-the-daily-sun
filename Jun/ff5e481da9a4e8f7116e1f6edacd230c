HAD it not been for his neighbour, Monaheng Makhina would probably be dead today. The 31-year-old man from Khayelitsha, Mangaung arrived home from the tavern on Sunday night very drunk and very hungry. “I put on the stove and fried some meat, but I fell asleep,” he said. Luckily for him, his neighbour, Paseka Bruintjies (39), went outside to pee. This was at just about the same time that Monaheng’s shack caught fire. Paseka raced to the shack and pulled his drunk neighbour away from the fire. Monaheng said: “I thought I was dreaming when someone pulled me from my bed. When I woke up there was smoke everywhere. We got out from the side of the shack where Paseka had removed the corrugated iron sheeting.” He is grateful to Paseka for saving his life. “I will never forget him. In my life he will always be a hero. If he hadn’t helped me I would be dead!” Paseka said: “It was about 8pm when I went out to pee. I saw smoke coming from his shack. I knew he was inside because I had seen him coming back from the tavern. I ran to the shack and pulled him away from the flames. We tried to stop the fire but it was too late. Everything was destroyed but I’m glad he’s alive.”
