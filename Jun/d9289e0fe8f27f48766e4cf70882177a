THE four siblings who died in a fire were laid to rest on Saturday. Mbalenhle (7), Zamokuhle (4), Zemvelo (2) and Khethokuhle (1) Maduna burnt to death when a fire broke out in a bedroom where they were sleeping. Their mum Hlengiwe Maduna (23), from KwaGcwensa in Durban, allegedly locked them in the house when she went to visit her boyfriend. Hlengiwe was taken to a place of safety after the incident as some residents blamed her for the deaths and threatened to kill her. She lost her balance when she tried to get into the hearse after the service and was carried into the hearse by her family members. Speaking at the funeral, her uncle Siphiwe Maduna (58) said he was told residents were angry and blamed his niece for the deaths. He pleaded with them to calm down. “The only thing we need is to find out what caused the fire. Whoever is behind it will be dealt with by the law. People should not point fingers at this stage until the truth is known.” Thule Thwala spoke on behalf of the children’s father. She said they were still upset by the way the children died. “My brother lost all his children at once. We still want to know why Hlengiwe failed to save even one child.”
