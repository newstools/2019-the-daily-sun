BOTH Grahamstown and Border Alliance taxi associations are accusing government of causing infighting between taximen. Grahamstown Taxi Association secretary Nkosana Khuselo told Daily Sun they have been waiting for payments from the Eastern Cape Transport Department since the Freedom Day celebrations. He said Nolitha Douw got the tender to transport people to Grahamstown, where President Cyril Ramaphosa was addressing the nation and they quoted R300 000. “We expected to get our money by the end of the month, but we have not received anything. She claims she was only asked by the department to be the coordinator.” “But now she tells us there is no money and our quote was too expensive,” he said. The taximen said they even approached an official named Luthando from the department, with whom Nolitha had negotiated. Luthando from the department refused to give his surname. He said the questions should be addressed to Nolitha because she has all the information. Nolitha asked for extra time because she was busy with something else. Transport spokeswoman Khuselwa Rantjie said: “The department has paid three service providers that were appointed to efficiently and effectively manage the process as per the quotes and invoices submitted to us. We’re not aware of the alleged outstanding payment with regards to transporting of communities to the local government elections. The department does not have a responsibility to provide such a service.”
