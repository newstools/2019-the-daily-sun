THE Thabong family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit was given a certificate of appreciation by the Community Policing Forum on Friday. CPF chairman Best Mnyamane and deputy, Reverend Molahlehi Ranthako, said they made a surprise visit to the cluster offices to thank the unit for making the streets of Welkom safer for everyone. Police spokesman Captain Malebo Khosana said: “The certificate was given to the unit to recognise their willingness to serve the community with devotion, dedication, hard work and commitment.” Mnyamane said the communities of Bronville, Hennenman, Meloding, Thabong, Ventersburg, Virginia, Theunissen and Winburg appreciated the unit’s work to protect women and children. Unit commander Lieutenant-Colonel Kedibone Gopane thanked the community. “This is a good motivating gesture which will encourage us to do more than we are currently doing,” she said.
