MALEMON is preparing the crowds for his comeback album. Zwelakhe “Malemon” Mtshali (37) is ready to rock Mzansi with his music. The singer, who was part of the group called the Moskitos back in 2000, is back. After the Moskitos released three albums, they stopped singing together because of conflict with their recording label. Malemon told SunBuzz he has been working on his debut album Make It for 13 years, and said it features a selection of his best songs. “The last time the Moskitos released an album was in 2005 and I have been in studio since then. “Although I wasn’t releasing any music, I was recording and I’ve selected only the best songs I’ve done for this album. “I’ve already started performing some of the songs. People love them and that makes me confident.” Malemon, who was born and bred in Tembisa, started his career in the entertainment industry as a dancer in 1993 and joined dance group Via Tembisa in 1997. He then went on to dance for mbanqanga group Abagandayi in 2000 and also danced for Papa Penny until 2003. After quitting the industry in 2005, Malemon worked as a petrol attendant but was saving money for studio equipment. “Even though people thought leaving music meant my life was over, I knew it wasn’t. “I worked at the garage for seven years to save money because music was my life. “After saving enough, I bought studio equipment and worked as a producer for other people until I decided it was time to come back as a singer,” he said. Fans can look forward to Malemon’s kwaito and Afro- pop album which will be released in September.
