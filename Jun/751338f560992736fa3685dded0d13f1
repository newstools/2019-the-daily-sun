AFRO-soul artist Mellow has had her heart broken many times. Mellow, whose real name is Mamello Ngoepe (23), is a third-year mathematical statistics student at the University of Pretoria. Her last two relationships went sour. “It might be that I meet weak men who just want to play,” she said. “Music is my first love. Relationships can wait because they seldom work out. I’m studying just to have something to fall back on.” Mellow, from Mokopane in Limpopo, said she chose Afro-soul as it was timeless. She released an EP titled Asole this week. The singer who started her career by singing in restaurants said her music consists of the sad events and the happy times in her life. Mellow said she will be creating music with Mjakes Thebe and will feature R&B singer Masandi on her upcoming album. She also studied acting at the Market Theatre Laboratory and completed her first level last year.
