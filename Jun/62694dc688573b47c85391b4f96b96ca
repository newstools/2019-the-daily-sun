HENDRICK Ekstein has joined Orlando Pirates. Pirates pipped Cape Town City and SuperSport United who were also interested on signing the former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder. The 28-year-old was surprisingly released by Chiefs from his contract last month before it expired at the end of June. This was due to the fact that he didn’t agree with Chiefs’ management on a new contract, despite being influential in helping them reach the Nedbank Cup final. A source close to the player told SunSport that the deal has finally being sealed with the stocky player. Even Amakhosi coach Ernst Middendorp sang Ekstein’s praises, saying he’s the best player he has ever coached. The Chiefs graduate looked a revived player under the German coach. He scored two goals in the 3-0 away win over Elgeco Plus of Madagascar in the third round of the Caf Confederations Cup second leg. Our source confirmed yesterday: “Ekstein has signed with Pirates. He actually signed with the club last month after Chiefs failed to agree new terms with him.” Pirates administration officer, Floyd Mbele said he is not aware of Ekstein’s signing for the club. Mbele said: “I don’t know anything like that. From the club’s side there’s no such thing.” Last year Bucs signed Chiefs goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo. However, that moved backfired as Khuzwayo arrived at Pirates with an injury that kept him out for the entire season. The former Bafana keeper has yet to make his Bucs PSL debut having only played in the Pirates MulitChoice Diski Challenge side. Meanwhile, CT City chairman John Comitis admitted his club had an interest on the diminutive midfielder but he needed to speak to coach Benni McCarthy before making a move. McCarthy is on holiday in Scotland.
