KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has expressed concern over shooting incidents at Folweni schools. This came after two security guards were shot at Folweni High School, south of Durban, on Saturday. “It seems Folweni is an area we need to zoom into,” he said. “As a society, we need to find lasting solutions.” Mshengu said one guard was shot in the leg and theother in the chest. They were taken to hospital. “One guard is still critical,” said Mshengu. He said a Toyota Quantum engine and gearbox used for practicals in mechanical technology lessons were stolen. The admin block and the computer and science labs were also damaged. Teacher Sibonakaliso Nyawose (48) was brutally killed two weeks ago at a school in Folweni. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said charges of robbery and attempted murder were being investigated at the Folweni cop shop.
