Social Media can be trash sometimes, but on Sunday we saw that the platforms can be used for
good. When Thabisa Xhelithole (33) from Khayelitsha took to
Twitter to ask for a R10 electricity token. Mzansi Twitter responded
overwhelmingly, Xhelithole got more than she expected. A desperate Thabisa quoted the now famous "O jewa ke
eng?" question by @akreana_ with a message reading "Can anyone buy me
R10, electricity pliz! ??" "At that point I was desperate. There was nothing, I
wanted to cook some porridge for my baby who was desperately hungry. “I had asked my family for help and I felt that they had
enough of me asking. I was desperate, I had little data on my phone, and I took
to Twitter to ask for help," Xhelithole said. At the time of writing, Xhelithole had received more than
R1900 worth of electricity. “The first token I got was for R30 when I got that I was
happy. I'd be glad if that's all I got. But people kept on sending and sending
and sending. I told them that it was enough, but they kept on sending
anyway," Xhelithole said. Xhelithole is a single mother of two. She has a son who is
10 years old and a daughter who is 2 years old. "When people were celebrating Father’s Day. I was in
the dark asking for help from strangers because the father of my kids had given
up on them and left me to fend for them on my own," Xhelithole said. The people on social media are amazing. I asked for electricity,
but people were curious as to what else they could help. People have been
sending me whatever money they can, they've been sending me e-Wallets and
asking what else they can help me with. I have been overwhelmed by people's reactions. I appreciate
each and every one who helped by sending electricity, money or just retweeted.
It means a lot to me. I'd like to thank everyone," Xhelithole said.
