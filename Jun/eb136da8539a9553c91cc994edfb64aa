The
authorities have condemned a hijacking and shooting that left a truck driver
and his conductor in a critical condition in Durban on Tuesday. Paramedic
services tendered to the driver and his partner just after 10:30 on the N2
North bound just after the M1 Higginson Highway, before the M7 interchange. "On
arrival, we found that a truck driver and his conductor had sustained serious
injuries," Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said. One of the
men had sustained a gunshot wound to the head, while the other one was shot in
the stomach. KwaZulu-Natal
Premier Sihle Zikalala's said it was important to allow the police to
investigate the matter. "We
condemn any criminal activity, including this. Let's allow the police to
investigate." Department
of Transport spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa echoed Zikalala's sentiments. "We
condemn any violence. The police must be allowed to investigate the matter
before we can say what the cause of this is." Police
spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said they were investigating charges of
attempted murder and carjacking. "They
were taken to hospital for medical attention. The circumstances surrounding the
incident are still being investigated." Gwala could
not immediately confirm if the incident was linked to ongoing violence in the
trucking sector in KZN. During a
high-level press briefing on Monday, journalists heard that more than 60 trucks
had been torched in three weeks, with Minister of Police Bheki Cele adding that
17 were torched over the past weekend alone. Cele said
91 people had been arrested over a three-week period, adding that there was
little in the way of prosecutions. He added
that while many people were arrested, they were only charged with traffic
offences, saying he would work with the justice cluster to enforce harsher
punishments. SOURCE:
