ACCORDING to these residents, the government forgot about them a long time ago. Residents of Eugene squatter camp in Butterworth, who saw their shacks destroyed by a bulldozer in 2011, are still waiting for real houses. They told the SunTeam the Mnquma Municipality destroyed their shacks for a new shopping mall. They said the municipality told them to go to a new piece of land but they refused, saying the area often flooded. The human settlements department intervened and housed them in an abandoned factory until they were later moved to temporary structures. Community leader Boniswa Sandla told Daily Sun the government made empty promises. “We were told we would spend six months in these temporary structures before we got RDP houses but we have been here for eight years,” she said. “They just come during election time and promise many things. Our situation is very bad. “These structures are built near the river and the bush. It’s winter time now so cold weather is destroying us here. Many people die because of the cold.” Eastern Cape Human Settlements spokeswoman Phiwokuhle Soga said land had been identified and would form part of a settlement called Siyanda 5 000. “Before we can build, things like sewerage and water need to be put in place. The problem is that the whole municipality has challenges with bulk infrastructure services,” she said. “However, we are in communication with the Amathole and Mnquma municipalities as they need to solve these problems speedily. Mnquma was declared a disaster drought area. The municipality is working towards installing services here.”
