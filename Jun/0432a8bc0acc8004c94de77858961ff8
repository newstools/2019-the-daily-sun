THIS week SunWheels went to Dube, in Soweto, to meet Thabane Ndaba, who has been a biker for a few years. Thabane is contemplating selling his Honda VTR 1000 in exchange for his dream bike – a Harley Davidson. Q: What bike do you ride? A: A Honda VTR 1000 1998 model. Q: When did you buy it? A: I bought it in 2012. Q: Is it your first? A: No, it’s my third bike. Q: Do you have a licence? A: Yes, and I’ve been a biker for over eight years now. Q: Why did you choose this colour? A: I had no choice since I bought it from someone secondhand. Q: Why do you like it? A: It’s reliable. Q: Do you have a safety outfit? A: Yes. Safety comes first. Q: Would you lend it to someone? A: No, riding a bike is too risky. Q: How far have you ridden? A: Commuting to work I use my bike a lot. But for long distances I prefer a car. Q: Does it have a pet name? A: Nope. Q: Did you change anything on it? A: No, it’s still in its original state. Q: Is it your dream bike? A: No, my dream bike is a Harley Davidson. Q: What do you think of other road users? A: Most like speeding, and unnecessarily so. In most cases motorists don’t respect bikers. And not using safety belts is fatal.
