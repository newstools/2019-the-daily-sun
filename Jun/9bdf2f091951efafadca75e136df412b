FOR 13 years he’s been living with his terrible addiction, and he needs help. Mlungisi Mahlangu (26) from Emalahleni in Mpumalanga said he masturbates at least six times a day. “I never get enough. Even when I’ve been with my girlfriend all weekend,” he said. He said this also affected his relationship. “Sometimes I think my hand is better than my girlfriend,” said Mlungisi. His girlfriend Nomsa Mathebula knows he masturbates but didn’t think it was this bad. Clinical sexologist Dr Eve Wasserman told Daily Sun masturbation keeps your glands in good working order and helps keep the system flushed and lubricated. “But masturbating daily may inhibit sexual activities with your partner,” she said. Daily Sun asked its readers what they think about this. - Malumbazo said: A boy in Thailand masturbated 25 times in a day and died. So anything less than 25 times is fine.
