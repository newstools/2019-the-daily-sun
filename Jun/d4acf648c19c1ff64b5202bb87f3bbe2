BRAVE Banyana Banyana were the first side to experience being robbed by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in the Fifa Women’s World Cup. Banyana gave a good account for themselves in the first half of their World Cup opener against Spain scoring first through Thembi Kgatlana. However their party was spoiled in the 73rd minute when Spain were given a penalty from Janine Van Wyk’s handball. Jennifer Hermoso converted from the spot kick to level matters. With seven minutes to the final whistle things turned from bad to worse when controversy occurred referee Maria Carvajal gave Spain a second penalty after consulting VAR. Nothando Vilakazi was sent off after receiving a second booking as Hermoso stepped up to convert her second from the spot which change the whole complexion of the match. With few minutes remaining dejected Banyana tried to fight back looking for an equalizer but they were caught on the counter attack which saw Lucia Garcia scoring the third to seal the deal for her side. However, Kgatlana’s rise has been sensational for Banyana. The 23-year-old again proved on the biggest stage at the World Cup that she is a star in the making. Kgatlana scored a scorcher which she will always be proud of despite not getting three point in their opening match. This is Banyana’s first World Cup. They are one of the three Africa representatives, along with Cameroon and Nigeria. In Banyana’s next encounter they will face China PR who were defeated by Germany 1-0 in the other Group B match. The match will be played on Thursday at Parc des Princes in Paris (9pm).
