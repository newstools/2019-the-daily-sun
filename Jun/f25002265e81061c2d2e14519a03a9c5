MORE than 100 nurses from the department of correctional services were celebrated on recently. Nurses from prison hospitals in the Free State and Northern Cape took part in the International Nurses Day event. It was held at the Grootvlei Prison in Bloemfontein and aims to increase public awareness of the challenges experienced by nurses. The day is also a celebration of their contribution to healthcare. Regional commissioner for Free State and Northern Cape Subashini Moodley said: “It is in the Constitution that nurses provide healthcare to all the people of Mzansi.” About 137 nurses take care of inmates. “We felt it was time the region had its first event where we honour nurses.”
