A: It’s a Toyota Venture. Q: When did you buy your car? A: 2016. Q: Why do you love it so much? A: It puts food on my table and is reliable. This car also is fuel-efficient. Its performance on the road is good and is also safe to drive. Q: Is it your first car? A: No, it’s my third. My fourth car will be an Audi R8! Q: Tell us what you like about this car? A: It’s not sophisticated and is value for money. I call it Avacado because of its greenish colour. It’s compact and always a pleasure to drive. Q: Would you allow another person to drive it? A: Yes, my younger brother Tshepo can drive my car anytime. Q: Have you gone on long-distance trips in it yet? A: Not yet, all places I went to are in and around Gauteng. Q: Tell us about your choice of colour? A: It’s dark green. Q: How often do you get traffic fines? A: I don’t have traffic fines. Q: What do you think of other drivers on the roads? A: We’re all using the same rules and regulations, but other drivers get distracted by small things like using their cellphones while driving. The other big problem we have on our roads is unroadworthy vehicles, driving under the influence and reckless driving.
