FRUSTRATED adult basic education and training teachers across KZN marched on Friday. They sang and held up placards as they walked from King Dinuzulu Park to the Durban City Hall to hand over a memorandum to the department of basic education. They were demanding better pay and for their basic salaries to be paid on a fixed date each month. They said they were tired of claiming for the hours they had worked as their invoices often went missing in the system. They said the claims system delayed payments and they could no longer go for months without being paid. Bongani Phakathi, chairman of the Abet Educators’ Forum, said: “We have been begging the department to deal with this matter since 2015 but nothing’s been done. “That’s why we decided to take it to the street so they will know how serious we are about this,” said Phakathi. He said more than 500 teachers had not been paid since January because their claims had allegedly gone missing. The department’s community education regional acting director Sipho Mncube promised that the memorandum would be sent to the relevant people.
