NOTHING will stop Xolani Nzimande from doing what his heart desires. The 47-year-old wheelchair-bound man from KwaMashu B section, north of Durban, is a member of the Hlahlindlela Club for the Disabled. He said before this he had been to similar centres catering for disabled people, which helped a lot. “We talk about the challenges we as disabled people encounter on a daily basis and help each other,” Xolani told Daily Sun. “I’ve been to various organisations where I learned many skills, such as basket weaving. Xolani was diagnosed with polio when he was four months old. He said he lived with his mother in uMzimkhulu, KZN, at the time. But she didn’t know how to care for a disabled child. “I didn’t go to school. I played with other kids when they came home from school,” he said. He later lived in Durban with his aunt, who took him to eThembeni Special School. “My aunt arranged for me to get crutches. That really changed my life,” said Xolani. But he stopped going to school in 1990 as there was no money in the house. When he could no longer use crutches he got a wheelchair. “Sitting at home was the last thing I wanted to do. I decided to join organisations for disabled people,” said Xolanis. He said being in a wheelchair did not mean his brain was not working. “I want to own a centre for the disabled. “I don’t foresee anything stopping me from doing that.”
