THE Eastern Cape government yesterday announced it would be cutting the cost of the state of the province address taking place on Friday, 28 June. Speaker Helen Sauls-August announced it had been decided that the event would be held at the Raymond Mhlaba Chamber in Bhisho, and there would be far fewer guests this year. “Catering for guests will be reduced from a three-course meal to a finger lunch. “The printing of invites, which was previously outsourced, will now be done internally. “The budget for this year has been reduced to between R700 000 and R800 000. The legislature will save around R2,5 million annually by doing this.” In the past, the event cost between R3,5 million and R5 million as large amounts of money were spent on tent villages, catering, toilets, generators, fridges, screens and invitation cards. She said everyone in the legislature needed to remember they were voted into positions of power to serve the interests of residents and solve their problems. Premier Lubabalo Mabuyane welcomed the changes. “This decision is good for the people of our province,” he said.
