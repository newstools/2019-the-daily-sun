GATVOL residents of Mabopane block U, Tshwane, said they’d been without water for four days and went on the rampage yesterday. They took to the streets and blocked a road with burning tyres and branches. Resident Samuel Ngobeni (40) said: “We want water. No one can live without water, and it’s our right to have it.” He said they were hoping their water supply would be restored on Sunday, but it wasn’t. He said the municipality should have told them their water was being cut off. Municipal spokesman Lindela Mashigo said: “Rand Water restriction has affected the pressure level. This has since been sorted out. “A huge pipe has been leaking. It wasn’t easy to notice the leak because it wasn’t visible on the ground. Our team from the water and sanitation division finally identified the leakage, and we’re now busy exposing the pipe so it can be fixed.” Mashigo couldn’t how long the repairs would take. Captain Rheineth Motlana said almost 100 protesters blocked the road with burning tyres next to the Ipeleng Traffic Department. Public order cops and Metro police monitored the situation but there was no violence. The road was eventually cleared and no arrests were made.
