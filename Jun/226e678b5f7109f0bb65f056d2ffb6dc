Paul Dolezar will go down as one of the coaches who entertained millions of South African fans with his broken English and his funny antics on the touchlines. The Frenchman arrived at Kaizer Chiefs in 1997 and was an instant hit with the fans. He led the Amakhosi in winning the Rothmans Cup in 1997 and 1998. The following year, he won the same trophy with Mamelodi Sundowns and was nicknamed Mr Rothmans Cup. He was always animated on the touchlines and looked like a mad choir conductor when he dictated tactics to his players ¬– and was sometimes referred to as "a heart attack waiting to happen". One thing about him he hated losing and wanted to win all the matches. In one match during penalty shoot-outs, he hid his face with his arms so that he could not see his player taking the deciding penalty kick. He only celebrates afterwards when he heard the fans screaming. Describing the first final as heart-stopping, Dolezar once spoke to The Star newspaper IOL about that memorable clash between Chiefs and Sundowns in 1997. "I thought I had the cup in my pocket. Then Sizwe Motaung allowed Raphael Chukwu to score. I wanted to die." That last-minute equaliser by Sundowns forced extra time and then a replay, which Chiefs won on penalties. Never one to hide his feelings, Dolezar lashed out at Motaung after the first match, describing Motaung’s mistakes as "CRIMINAL." Dolezar will also be remembered for his hilarious comments about the late Isaac “Shakes” Kungoane’s blind passes which delighted Amakhosi legions, but not the Frenchman: "He confuse my players…he look this way and passes that way."
