A MPUMALANGA family is still shocked after a decomposing body was found buried in a shallow grave in their back yard. It has been three months since a 21-year-old suspect allegedly buried his girlfriend after they had an argument in March. The family from Agincourt Village outside Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge said their son revealed on Saturday that the body had been in the yard for almost three months. A family member escorted the man to the Mhala cop shop to notify the police. The 42-year-old mum told Daily Sun her son had been staying with her in Gauteng since earlier this year, but she was unaware of the gruesome secret. “I noticed some changes in his behaviour. He became violent. I kept asking him to speak to me,” she said. “He finally told me he had killed his girlfriend and her body was wrapped in a bag in a shallow grave at home.” His mother said they arranged transport to go to the village and he showed them the body. “He told me he did not mean to kill her but they were arguing. He hit her with something on the head and she collapsed.” She said they didn’t know how they were going to tell the girl’s family about her murder. Villager Vinolia Mashego (31) said the village was in shock. “We want the murderer to be punished,” said Vinolia. Captain S’fiso Nyakane confirmed cops were investigating a murder case. “A 21-year-old suspect confessed to the murder. “After digging at the scene, police found a decomposed body. The suspect was arrested.” The suspect is expected to appear in the Mhala Magistrates Court today.
