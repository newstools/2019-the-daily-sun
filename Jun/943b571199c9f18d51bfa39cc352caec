THE lives of patients living with HIV/AIDS are at risk due to a shortage of ARVs. This is according to the Stop Stockouts Project organisation. While the shortage of ARVs first came to light last year, it appears the situation hasn’t been resolved. The shortages are said to be in second line ARVs. The organisation said patients who have become resistant to ARVs may have no alternative due to the shortages. Second line ARVs include lamivudine/abacavir, lamivudine/zidovudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Affected provinces are said to be Free State, Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and KZN. The organisation’s project co-ordinator Kopano Klaas said: “Patients are at risk of defaulting on their treatment and increasing the potential of infecting their partners.” He said efforts to establish why there’s a shortage of stock from the department of health have been unsuccessful. “These stockouts have been unresolved since the second half of last year and the situation has now escalated into a crisis,” said Klass. But there’s no data on the number of patients who defaulted and may have developed resistance to first-line therapy. At the time of going to print, the department had not responded to queries.
