HUNDREDS of mourners gathered to say their goodbyes to Free State journalist Junior Bonase in Springfontein on Saturday. The funeral was attended by officials from the premier’s office, colleagues, pastors and community members. Daily Sun published the story of Junior’s death on 24 May. He was found dead on the side of the road last Tuesday night. According to family spokesman Mohau Leine, Junior was attending a meeting in Parys. The 41-year-old worked for Dumelang Media and the local Tharollo newspaper in Mangaung. A passerby found his body on the N1 in Heuningspruit near Kroonstad. It is not yet known how Junior died. Journalist Lebona Lekoenea said: “I don’t know what my life will be like without you after you were taken away from me. “I worked with Junior. He was a humble man. He helped me when I opened my newspaper. “He was never selfish and gave people advice or information. I lost a very supportive friend. We shared almost everything.” The family urged the cops to bring the culprit to book. They suspect his death was intentional as he did not tell them who he was going to meet in Parys, as he often did. Free State Media Co-operative spokesman Khayalethu Mantsantsa said: “We would like to guarantee the family and public that we’ll never rest until we know what happened to our late brother. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the cause of death was unknown, and a culpable homicide case was being investigated.
