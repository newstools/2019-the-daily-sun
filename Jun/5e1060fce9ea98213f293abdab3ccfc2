Willowvale cops arrested two teenagers for allegedly raping
of a 75-year-old gogo. The gogo was reportedly attending a traditional ceremony on
Sunday night at Rhaladiya, Chafutweni Village. “According to information the woman went outside her when
two suspects grabbed her and raped her. “Fortunately, there was an eyewitness who saw what was
happening. The witness raised an alarm calling on the community to come and
rescue the victim,” Police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha said. Manatha said the community members caught the alleged
perpetrators. Following that the police were called and both suspects were
arrested and charged with rape. The two suspects will appear before the Willowvale
Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday on a charge of rape. Butterworth Cluster Commander Brigadier Ngangema Xakavu
condemned the rape of an elderly person by the suspects. He appealed to the traditional leaders to end traditional
ceremonies at 17:00 to avoid crimes such as murder and rape.
