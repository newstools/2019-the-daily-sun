COPS in Brits, North West, are investigating the murder of Felies Sithembile (15) of Thaba-Morula High School. Provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh said: “It is alleged that Sithembile was on his way home from school when the suspect, a pupil at another school, stabbed him with a knife. “The incident occurred along the Segwaleane Road in Brits,” she said. She said according to information, the victim was taken to a local clinic by a passerby but died of his injuries.” Myburgh said the suspect fled the scene but was handed over at the Mooinooi Police Station by his parents on Tuesday morning. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane said: “The police are working hard to implement crime prevention programmes at schools, but we can’t do it alone. “The public have a responsibility to work with police to help stop the violence.”
