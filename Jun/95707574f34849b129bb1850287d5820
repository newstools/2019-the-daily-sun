THE family of taxi driver Themba Tebela wants justice for his murder. He was found beaten and burned in Soshanguve, Tshwane, last Wednesday. He died in hospital on Tuesday. His sister, Brenda (30), said he was employed as a taxi driver three weeks ago, and he was supposed to fix the taxi but it got stolen. “Last Monday, he came home scared, saying the taxi was stolen. The next day, the owner came to fetch him and they went to report the matter at the police station,” said Brenda. He said just when they thought the matter had been settled, the owner came to their house looking for Themba. “She came here with three men and they looked angry. They put him in their car and drove off,” she said. Brenda said the next day, she went to report the matter to the police but was told to wait for Themba to return home. She said when she called the taxi owner, she was shocked by what she was told. “She said she was with my brother and she was taking the law into her own hands because the police weren’t helping,” she said. “I called the cops to say I knew where my brother was but they said they had found him beaten and burned,” said Brenda. When Daily Sun contacted the taxi boss, she said: “Can I please not say anything. I just don’t want to say anything.” Police spokeswoman Captain Rheineth Motlana said a case of murder was opened but no arrests have been made.
