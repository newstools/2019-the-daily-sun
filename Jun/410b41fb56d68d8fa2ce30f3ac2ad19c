Two armed
men who jumped the school fence of Sea Point High School in Cape Town disrupted
an exam session this week by assaulting a teacher and making off with a bundle
of cellphones. The men
entered a classroom around 10:10 on Wednesday, before threatening a teacher and
pupils, and then stealing the goods, said Western Cape police spokesperson
Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut. He said the
men had yet to be arrested. Ward 54
councillor Nicola Jowell shared on her Facebook page that they had disrupted an
exam and hurt the invigilator. Provincial
Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said the perpetrators reportedly assaulted the
teacher with a gun and made off with 50 cellphones. The teacher
was injured in their face and was seeking medical attention. The men had
jumped over the school fence. The school has a security guard and CCTV cameras. "...
We hope that the SAPS will use the camera footage to identify the suspects and
ensure they face the full might of the law," said Schäfer. The
education department's specialised support directorate was informed. The school
has a counsellor and psychologist on site for those who required support. "I
have also requested that this case be added to the Watching Brief Lists and my
office has already made contact with the Sea Point SAPS," said Schäfer. "I am
genuinely concerned that criminals have become so brazen that they enter school
premises on a busy road, in broad daylight, and that not even a strong security
presence, CCTV footage or fencing serve as a deterrent." She
condemned the incident, saying schools were meant to be places of safety. SOURCE: NEWS24
