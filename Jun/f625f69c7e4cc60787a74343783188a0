KAIZER Chiefs striker Khama Billiat says he has been battling with confidence on the ball, especially since he moved to Naturena. But he admits that he is more confident and at ease when he is with his national team Zimbabwe, where he says language plays a major role. “I have never been happy with my form,” he told SunSport from Durban, where the Warriors will face Zambia in the Cosafa Cup semi-final at Moses Mabhida Stadium tonight (7.30pm). “...I always believe there’s more to offer from my side.” It goes without saying that Billiat has had a season to forget at Chiefs, where he ran on a low key. Billiat joined Chiefs at the beginning of the past season from Mamelodi Sundowns, a move that was said to have been influenced by an improved salary. The 28-year-old has been winning monthly PSL awards, but nothing major to complement his big move to Amakhosi, where he has been blowing hot and cold. He emphasised that he is more active and influential when he is with the Warriors. “We’ve got a different philosophy. We play differently and we understand each other better,” he said. “Zimbabwe is where I come from, and language plays a big role. It doesn’t matter whether we won the league last season or you finished last, when you play this game and play for your country, there’s always better understanding as players.” Zim coach Sunday Chidzambwa has brought in a strong squad to win the Cosafa Cup. Players such as Knowledge Musona, Ovidy Karuru, Talent Chawaphiwa, Marshal Munetsi, Divine Lunga, Knox Mutizwa, Elvis Chipezeze, Walter Musona are in the team. They have been joined by Teenage Hadebe and Kuda Mahachi. Unlike Bafana Bafana, who brought the squad made-up of Under-23s, Zimbabwe are taking advantage of this competition to fine-tune ahead of their second consecutive Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt. They are in Group A with Egypt, DR Congo and Uganda.
