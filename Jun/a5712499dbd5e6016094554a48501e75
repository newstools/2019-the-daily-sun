AFTER grabbing headlines when a video emerged on social media, in which she appeared drunk and using foul language to the cops, actress and TV personality Khanya Mkangisa is letting her hair down on holiday in Bali, Indonesia. The star was in alleged drunken driving blitz two weeks ago and she admitted to wrong doing and subsequently apologised. “I was in the wrong, no one should be ever driving under the influence, for whatever reason.... That shouldn’t have happened, that I acknowledge but keep the same energy, treat me like you would everyone else,” she told DJ Fresh on The Fresh Breakfast shows. Now Khanya seems to have put all the drama behind her and instead of getting caught up on the wrong side of the law, she is having some down time in Bali. The Selimathunzi star has been posting a series of pictures on her Instagram account having fun in the sun in Bali. ??
