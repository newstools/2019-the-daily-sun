GOGO Maria Vukeya (67) told Daily Sun she was worried about a disturbing dream on Thursday morning. She dreamt Police Minister Bheki Cele and a man in a suit paid a visit to her house in Malamulele, Limpopo. “I was woken up by this dream but never got to hear what Cele said.” But later she learnt the horrible truth. “I was seeing my grandson’s death.” Constable Nhlamulo Vukeya (28) from Protea South, Soweto was shot at Nancefield Hostel in Soweto on Thursday. His sister Hlamulani Vukeya (31) said the news was all over social media before the family was told about it. “Somebody phoned me to check if my brother was really dead. “I phoned his number and a cop confirmed the news. I rushed to Moroka Police Station, where he worked,” she said. Hlamulani said her cousin, also a cop, called her and told her they heard the bad news over the police radio. She said her cousin put the tape around the crime scene. “He asked who was shot and they said it’s just one their members.” By the time she called her mum, Rose Vukeya (50), the news had already reached her. Rose told the SunTeam at first she was angry no one had come to formally inform the family of this tragedy. “But now I am okay because they were here,” Rose said. Cele promised to attend the funeral. “Nhlamulo will be given a dignified funeral because he died a hero. We will investigate who leaked the news on social media,” he said.
