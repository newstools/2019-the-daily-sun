POLICE Commissioner General Khehla Sitole is happy that suspects linked to an attempted Orange Farm cash-in-transit robbery have been bust. Two firearms were recovered. Sitole praised the bravery of security officers who stopped the robbery in the Sedibeng area, Gauteng on Tuesday. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the van was collecting cash at a petrol station when five armed suspects approached the crew. Peters said the suspects took cash from a security guard and shot him in the leg before taking his gun and trying to flee. “The van driver saw what was happening and chased the suspects’ vehicle, pushing it off the road until it stopped. “The suspects were forced to leave their vehicle and some of the stolen cash behind, escaping on foot.” One suspect was found with a rifle and bust. Peters said the police recovered an illegal firearm and the stolen cash. Sitole wished the injured security officer a speedy recovery after he was taken to hospital for medical attention. “The quick thinking of the van driver, as well as the quick response by the police deserves praise. “We will fight cash-in-transit robberies in a united way to ease the fear these crimes cause residents,” Sitole said.
