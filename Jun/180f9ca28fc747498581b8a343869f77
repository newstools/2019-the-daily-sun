WHEN the matric pupil came to school in his parents’ bakkie on Monday, pupils cheered. But his joyride turned to tragedy when he rammed into a group of kids sitting under a mango tree next to the schoolyard. Grade 8 pupil Koketso Rahlane (14) was killed and eight others injured in the incident at Mohlatlego Machaba High School in Ga-Motupa, near Tzaneen in Limpopo. The driver apparently fled on foot after the incident. The eight injured pupils were admitted to Letaba Hospital and discharged that evening. Koketso’s mum Unice (32) said a teacher called her to the school. “When I arrived Koketso was bleeding from his nose. “He was rushed to Motupa Clinic and from there was taken to hospital. He died from internal injuries and broken ribs,” she said. A 14-year-old who managed to get away from the bakkie said the driver was speeding. “We are now too scared to sit under the mango tree.” Tzaneen education department circuit manager Khashane Nomvela said teachers visited the survivors. “All the pupils were discharged from hospital, except for the one who was taken to Mediclinic in town with broken legs.” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a culpable homicide case was opened. “We’ve made no arrest yet, but the pupil who was allegedly driving was taken in for questioning.”
