The Tshwane North College in Mamelodi, has been closed since last Monday. Students at the FET college vowed to keep it closed until they were given their NSFAS allowances. They claimed the college paid allowances to some students but sent others from pillar to post. For the past week, hundreds of students have been toyi-toying outside the college, refusing to write exams. Student Mxolisi Mtsweni said they approached NSFAS for their allowances but were sent to the college. He said they had sent many emails and letters to the management of the college, with no response. “What are they hiding? Why are they running around? Why can’t they just give us a straight answer? It looks like they are hiding something,” he said. Mxolisi said management didn’t even inform the higher education department about their protest. “They are acting in a suspicious manner. For a week now, they have been sitting in offices and peeping out through windows. “I’m sure if there was an investigation, some people would run away before the findings were made public.” Another student, Cassius Mathebula, said management was incompetent. “They just sit in front of computers and pretend to be smart. I’m asking myself if they are qualified,” he said. Higher education department spokesman Lunga Ngqengelele didn’t answer his phone or reply to text messages sent to him by the SunTeam.
