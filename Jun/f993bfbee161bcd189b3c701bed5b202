THEY had just finished watching Generations: The Legacy when the lights suddenly went off on Tuesday night. Early yesterday morning, angry residents of the Siyabangena squatter camp near Philippi, Cape Town, torched a Golden Arrow bus after their illegal electricity connections were disrupted. Zoliswa Lizo (37) told Daily Sun residents were not told the electricity would be cut. She said the power wasn’t cut by Eskom but by security guards working for an unidentified company. She said Eskom didn’t mind that residents were connecting power illegally from the nearby transporter. “They even fix it when it gives us problems,” said Zoliswa. Lubabalo Nkombisa (54) confirmed this. “We want them to stop harassing us because Eskom is fine with us connecting there,” Lubabalo told the People’s Paper. “We are going to cause chaos until they allow us to continue connecting there.” Captain Bheki Xulu of the Philippi East Police Station said about 30 community members blocked the road with stones and burnt tyres on Tuesday night. “They connect illegally to that transformer,” said Xulu. “A public violence docket has been opened. No injuries have been reported and no arrests have been made.” Bronwen Dyke-Beyer of Golden Arrow said the bus was completely burnt out. “At this stage the motive is unknown,” said Dyke-Beyer. She said there were no passengers on board at the time, but the driver received treatment for shock. She said there was no significant effect on company services.
