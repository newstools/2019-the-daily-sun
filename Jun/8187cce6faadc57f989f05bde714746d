AFTER a woman and her unborn baby died, a resident told KZN Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu. Without wasting time, the MEC paid an announced visit to Isithebe Clinic in Mandeni. Sithembile Shabane (23) had been transferred from the clinic last Friday to General Justice Gizenga Memorial Hospital in KwaDukuza, where she died the next day. Her death sparked anger among residents. They accused the staff of negligence and threatened to march to the clinic and destroy it. The MEC said the department would investigate all the circumstances around Sithembile’s death. The MEC said firm action would be taken if anyone was found guilty of negligence. “Residents were upset so we came to see for ourselves, engage with the staff and find out what happened.” She said she expected to receive a report in a month’s time and would provide feedback. Shabane family spokesman Vusi Hlekwayo said: “We are glad the MEC came to see the situation. But we are sad to have lost our loved one due to the ‘negligence’ that occurred at a government hospital. It gives us pain that someone has died due to inadequate care,” he said. He hoped the matter would not be taken lightly.
