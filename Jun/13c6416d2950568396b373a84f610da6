 IS there a serial killer on the loose? This is the question Tshwane residents are asking. While police are working hard to bust the alleged killers of men believed to be homeless, they have urged homeless people to remain vigilant and sleep in groups to be safe. This after the discovery of the fourth body of a man believed to be homeless. The body was discovered on a pavement at the corner of Justice Mohammed and Troye Streets  in Sunnyside on Tuesday morning. Police spokesman Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the cause of death and motive are part of investigations. “The preliminarily investigation could only reveal that the deceased suffered an injury towards the back of the head,” he said. Mavimbela said police pleaded with anyone with information to go to their nearest police station. “Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect may contact the police anonymously on Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211,” he said. He said a case of murder was being investigated. Previously, a third body of a homeless man was found in Magnolia Park in Muckleneuk last Sunday. Police have since launched a manhunt. The second body, also of a homeless man, was also found in Magnolia Park, while the first one was found at a bush near Mears Train Station in Muckleneuk..
