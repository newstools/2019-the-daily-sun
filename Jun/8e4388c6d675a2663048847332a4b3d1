THE ANC Youth League in Newcastle wants their provincial leaders to disband the party’s regional committee under mayor Ntuthuko Mahlaba. Regional league chairman Senzo Khumalo said Mahlaba undermined the ANC by refusing to obey the party’s decision that all officials facing criminal charges should step down from government positions. Mahlaba was supposed to step down, along with eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede on Monday but he was still holding on to his job. Khumalo said Mahlaba was in full control of the regional leadership as chairman so the ANC would have to disband the committee to deal with him. Provincial party secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli said Mahlaba wrote to them two weeks ago to say he would step down but later changed his mind, saying he would not resign. Ntuli said provincial leaders would visit Newcastle to meet Mahlaba and make him account for going against their orders. He said once the PEC made a decision, all party members needed to obey it. “No one is above the party. This weekend, I will go to Newcastle with my working committee to sort out the problems there,” Ntuli said. “Mahlaba will have to account for the statement he made that he would not take 30 days leave, which was the ANC’s decision. “We will also look into the problems the Youth League has with the regional leadership, because they have been bashing one another in the media.” Mahlaba is currently out on bail after being accused of killing Youth League deputy regional secretary Wandile Ngubeni in 2016.
