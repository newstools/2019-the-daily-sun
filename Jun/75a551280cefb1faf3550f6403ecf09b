MEMBERS of the Alliance for Rural Democracy marched to the Union Buildings in Tshwane yesterday. They wanted the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership and Traditional Courts bills to be removed. Their memorandum, which they wanted to give to President Cyril Ramaphosa, was received by director-general in the presidency, Cassius Lubisi. The marchers said they wanted the president to give them a response within 14 days. Ramaphosa had not yet signed the bills into law. They were passed by parliament in March. The marchers said the bills were a return to apartheid and colonial bantustan laws, and they would not sit back and watch 362 years of struggle being rolled back. Constance Mogale, national co-ordinator of the alliance, said the bills would undermine democracy in rural areas. The marchers were supported by the Sonke Gender Justice. They agreed the bills would see a return to the homelands system by having different laws applied to different parts of the country. Sonke policy development fellow Letlhogonolo Mokgoroane said the bill would also harm property rights, prevent access to courts and undermine gender equality.
