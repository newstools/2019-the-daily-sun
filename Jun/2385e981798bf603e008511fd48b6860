Eskom told Fin24 on Monday that the debt crisis that it was
locked in with various municipalities around the country had not improved since
last year, despite the establishment of an inter-ministerial task team and a
number of concessions to make repayment easier for councils.  This comes as Eyewitness News reported on Monday that the
township of Soweto in Johannesburg alone owed Eskom R18bn in unpaid bills for
electricity.  While Soweto falls under the Johannesburg Metropolitan
Municipality in terms of local government, none of the debt that the township
owes to Eskom for electricity belongs to the city.  Instead, the township buys its power directly from Eskom as
a consumer area, while the City of Johannesburg manages the payments and
consumption of its suburbs through the municipality's power entity, City Power.  The utility did not provide a breakdown of each of the top
ten defaulting municipalities and their debt. Rather, Eskom provided the debt
owed by municipalities in relation to the provinces that the councils reside
in.  One municipality in Gauteng owes Eskom R1.4bn. One
municipality in Limpopo owes Eskom R402m. One municipality in the North West
owes R424m. Four municipalities in Mpumalanga owe R5.1bn, while three
municipalities in the Free State owe R7.3bn.  In an emailed response to questions from Fin24, Eskom
spokesperson Dikatso Mothae said the debt challenge Eskom faced with
municipalities had not improved in over a year.  "No improvements have been observed and the debt
continues to grow. As of May 2019, the overall debt is at R21.1bn, a growth of
R7.5bn since end of March 2018 (R13.6bn).  "Eskom continues to pursue various means to collect the
debt including negotiating payment agreements, intermittent power supply
interruptions and attaching of assets with the defaulting municipalities,"
said Mothae.  https://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/debt-from-municipalities-has-only-grown-eskom-laments-20190624
