EVEN without a mandate for coach Stuart Baxter at the Afcon, SA Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan still expects Bafana Bafana to reach the knockout phase. “Whether you call it a mandate or whatever, we expect them to go to the second round – at least,” said Jordaan. “That’s why we have a bonus structure that starts in the second round. There’s no use to win one match and get this bonus. Go to the second round, then we give each one R320 000. “And if they were going to get the normal win bonus of R60 000 for each group match, they get R180 000 but we doubled it to say go to the second round.” Jordaan predicts that Namibia will pack the defence, and he said he was keen to see how the technical bench confronts a situation like that. “Every team has the same strategy against Bafana and somehow the coaches must say ‘what are we doing about this?’ “They’ll be six – seven at the back,” he said in reference to Namibia. “Even Seychelles did it during the Afcon qualifiers. But it’s not for me. It’s for the coaches to decide. Now that they just wait for you at the back, what are you going to do?
