Award-winning dancer and choreographer Oscar Buthelezi (27) is gearing up to represent Mzansi at the 33rd International Competition for Choreographers in Hanover, Germany, later this month. Born and bred in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, Oscar is among 19 finalists from the country who have been chosen to take part in the event from 21 to 22 June. About 250 dancers from more than 50 countries will showcase their trend-setting dance moves. Oscar, who won the 2019 Naledi Theatre Award for Best Original Choreography in a musical, The Colour Purple, said this was a humbling moment for him “I am excited because as South Africans, we’ve got something special to share with the world. Every time we go overseas, we give a taste of what we’re capable of.” If Oscar wins, he will get an opportunity to study overseas for three months as a choreographer. He also stands to win a cash prize. “Depending on the funding we get as Moving Into Dance Programme, we often go to poor communities to teach the youth about dance. We also select those who show potential for a three-year dance course with our company.” Oscar is also the six-time and only winner of the acclaimed Kurt Jooss Choreography Awards held in Germany every three years. He often teaches dance to youngsters in Newtown every Saturday through the dance programme.
