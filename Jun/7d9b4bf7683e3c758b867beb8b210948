Xolani Nkwezane has nearly lost hope of ever getting an RDP. The 58-year-old from Umlazi G section, south of Durban, said he’s been waiting for about six years to get an RDP. He said he, along with other residents, were promised by the ward councillor they’d get houses after they were left out of a 2013 housing project. He said he’s jobless and has a family of 10. He said after weeks went by without any indication their houses were going to be built, he went back to the councillor. He said the councillor made more promises. “We’re still waiting and it’s killing me inside. During the recent floods, my mud house nearly collapsed. “In the night there was heavy rain. We squeezed ourselves in one room as the kids were scared of sleeping in another room. “That fear saved their lives because the room they chose not to sleep in collapsed.” Ward councillor Sithenjwa Nyawose said: “We’re working on it. Most of those who were left out had homes in the area, where infrastructure like roads, passages and pipes were going to be build. “Why continue to build them houses that will be demolished later? It would have been a waste of funds.” Municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said the people left out of the project would be included in the Umlazi Part 6 project. He said the project was still in the planning stage.
