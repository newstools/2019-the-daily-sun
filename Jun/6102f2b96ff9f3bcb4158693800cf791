SUNREADERS, both men and women,
recently shared their tales of abuse. The violence they described
included bitten 4-5s, vandalism and burned clothes. When most people think of abuse,
they assume its men beating women. However, over the weekend, an allegedly
abusive wife in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, shocked the nation when she set her
husband’s bakkie alight outside a cop shop. He had apparently gone to open a
case against her. SunReaders shared their encounters
on Facebook. Muchenje said: “She crushed my
iPhone after she came across some nude pictures.” Manamela said: “I burnt all my ex’s
panties.” Mamello said: “She used to bite
me.” Jones said: “She would inspect the
sperm volume in the condom. If it was low, she would scratch my face with her
fake nails while screaming and breaking things. I left her.” Innes said: “My girlfriend broke
all the windows of my car and house on Women’s Day last year. Apparently, she
had attended a concert and got drunk.” Menzi said: “When I left him, he
threatened to shoot me in front of his family and girlfriend.” Robertson said: “My brother used to
fight a lot with his girlfriend. He thought he was disciplining her. But last
year, he killed her during a heated argument.” Maesela Frank said: “She attacked
me over WhatsApp conversations, and I was hospitalised for two weeks. She even
had the nerve to visit me and act as if nothing happened!” Masoka said: “My brother suffered
for 11 years. He was beaten, insulted, controlled and humiliated. One day he
confided, in me and said he still loved her. I was hurt and angry. It got too much,
and he almost lost his life, that’s when his eyes were opened. He just walked
away.” Muma Simulunga said: “She bit my
balls.”
