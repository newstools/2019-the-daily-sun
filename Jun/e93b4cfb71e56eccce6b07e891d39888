The ANC and EFF battles for Alexandra is getting more serious. On Monday morning, Gauteng MEC of Human Settlements Lebogang Maile
opened a case against EFF Gauteng Chairperson Mandisa Mashego. Maile was accompanied by his lawyer, Mashudu Tshivhase when he
opened the Crimen Injuria case at the Alexandra Police Station. "I have been insulted in my personal capacity. I remember
this lady in question saying that 'I want to address this thug Lebogang Maile.
She was addressing me in a personal capacity," Maile said. Maile said that the accusations by Mashego are baseless and that
they damage his reputation, image and integrity. "I am not taking this lightly. This is what they always do.
They always insult people, spread lies and pull populist stunts to get support.
It is not going to happen at my expense," Maile said. Maile said that he never benefitted unduly from the Alexandra
Renewal Project or any government projects. "If I was guilty. I would have resigned, and I wouldn't have
wasted the police's time and my advocate's time. I would have done the
honourable thing," Maile said. Maile also said that he started the process of a civil suit
against the EFF. He said that he will decide how much he wants from the EFF and
Mandisa. He said that he will donate the money from the lawsuit to the people
of Alexandra.
