FORMER Bafana Bafana coach Jomo Sono has given Stuart Baxter’s boys at the Africa Cup of Nations (Acon) finals in Egypt the thumbs up, and reckons they still have a chance to advance to the second round. “They still have a chance,” Sono stated. “That Bafana team have a lot of quality, same as Zimbabwe. “There are star players, it just depends on the day. Sometimes things do not happen as you planned. At times you can play all the beautiful football but still not get a good result.” Bafana are under immense pressure to win their Group D match against Namibia tonight (10pm), at the Al Salam Stadium, to keep tabs on leaders Ivory Coast and Morocco. They conclude the group stages against Ivory Coast on Monday (6pm). Sono admitted that it would be woeful if the 1996 Africa champions fail to make the country proud, again. “It would be disappointing if they do not make into the next round of the competition,” said Sono. “But I still say losing the first game does not mean the tournament is over. “They are still in with a chance in the remaining two games. “Tournaments like Afcon are not as easy as they look.”
