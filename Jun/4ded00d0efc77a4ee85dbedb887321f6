Metro FM listeners are threatening to boycott the station if
it doesn't bring back DJ Fresh, real name Thato Sikwane. DJ Fresh has been off air for more than a week now and fans
are not having it. #BringBackDJFresh trended at number one on Twitter on
Tuesday morning, as fans voiced their disdain of not having Fresh on their
radio in the morning.  "Bring back the Big dawg else you will lose listeners
and am one of them" @Kenneth12071931said.  "What irks me is that this new arrangement w/o Som Mpho
& (Angie) was shoved down our throats @METROFMSA ??
and now yal suspend Fresh without any regard for your loyal listeners? Yal
don't know the power of black Twitter ne... What a joke," Mpho Maisa
tweeted.  "#BringBackDJFresh eh comrades I think we should
consider Boycotting they Show, We will not Participate in the show till we get
answers, No offence to Lebo & Angie, yall Amazing, MARA WE WANT FRESH.

unscheduled. Mthembu said that she can't divulge the reason why he has
been unscheduled and wouldn't give a timeframe of how long Fresh will be off
the air. According to reports by the Sunday World, Fresh was
suspended after the SABC received a complaint from a listener from the BCCSA.
