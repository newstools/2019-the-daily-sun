SUVs, like double-cabs, are Mzansi’s favourites. On the surface, people love these cars because they are strong with safety features. We took the Isuzu MU-X 3.0 4x2 2018 model for a spin and it tackled obstacles with ease. When you look at their SUV, and the D-MAX double cab, you will agree that Isuzu Motors SA is quite serious about solidifying its position in the market. The MU-X compares well with other SUVs.The only competitor that resembles the MU-X is the Toyota Fortuner 2,8 GD-6 automatic. Both look better than the Ford Everest 3.2 XLT and the Mistubishi Pajero Sport 2,4 D4. Excitement awaits you in this driver-friendly relaxed cabin.  It has eye-catching features, including the big infotainment touch screen – which makes it look better than the normal KB cabins. It has leather seats, an Apple CarPlay/android auto, climate control, cruise control, electronic seats and mirrors, among other bells and whistles. Driving this seven-seater spacious car is a breath of fresh air. Everyone on board feels safe and comfortable during long family trips. Isuzu’s most trusted 3,0-litre 4 cylinder turbo-diesel gives the MU-X 130kW and 380Nm of power as it climbs up and down the hills and valleys. Its six-speed transmission driven rear wheels affords you smooth performance while it saves you money on fuel with every acceleration. It guzzles a mere 10.5 litres per 100km at 120km/h. As soon as drivers get to know what they would get from the MU-X than you from the KB, focus will immediately shift. It’s a force to be reckoned with in the SUV market. This car ticks all the right boxes. It remains the most affordable at R568 000 – with a five-year 120 000km warranty and a five-year/90 000km service plan. If you’re looking for an SUV with strength and character, the MU-X is your best choice.
