THE cruel thugs raped the mum and her kids when they didn’t get what they came for. Then they showed how little they cared by eating their bread and drinking their cold drink! The devastated mum from Midas in Mabopane, Tshwane, told Daily Sun her horror started when three men broke into her home last Friday night. The 30-year-old mum of four said two of her children and a neighbour’s child were sleeping when the men broke in. “The children were in the other bedroom and I was in mine,” she said. She said two men went into her bedroom and asked for money. “I pleaded with them to take everything in the house and not hurt us. I gave them R800, which was all I had in the house, but they said they wanted more,” she said. The mum, her two children, aged 12 and 14, and her neighbour’s child (12) were raped. “Then they sat and ate all our bread while we helplessly watched them,” she said. She called her neighbours after the men left and they were taken to the hospital. “I don’t know who the men were. One of them had a cross tattooed on his back with words written on top. He also had an operation scar on his tummy,” she said. Police spokeswoman Captain Rheineth Motlana said cases of house robbery and rape were opened. “No one was arrested but an investigation is underway,” she said.
