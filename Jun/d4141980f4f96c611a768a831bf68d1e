Actress and Presenter Pearl Thusi is one of the most recognisable
faces in Mzansi. With her fair complexion, beautiful smile, long legs and big
bouncy hair, this woman is a force to be reckoned with. Pearl Thusi’s hair is one of the most unique beauty
appearance of this celeb. Her long big bouncy hair is the envy of many girls with
#BigHairDon’tCare goals and #Afro goals. Pearl like many women usually switches up her hair with
different kind of hairstyles such as weaves, clip ins, braids and coloured
wigs, but it is her Afro that we like the best. Pearl has such a huge passion for hair, she even has her own
Hair care range with local hair brand Afrobotanics called Black Pearl with Pearl Thusi. Pearl’s hair is great for some inspiration if you’re
thinking of playing around with some big curls. See pictures below of Pearl Thusi’s hair inspiration: Happy workers day everybody... ????‍????‍????‍????‍?????‍????‍????
