AFTER three suicides in one month, residents now suspect that their area is haunted by evil spirits. Residents of KwaMancinza, north of Durban, say they are worried and fear that more deaths will follow after three men killed themselves earlier this month. They said although the suicides were for different reasons, they were worried. The latest man to take his life is Thabo Mlotshwa (35). He was found hanging from the roof of his shack on Wednesday night. His death followed that of Musa Mjwaha, who killed himself earlier in the month. Bheka Mthembu was found hanging from a tree outside his home this month. Resident Nombuso Mchunu (55) said it seemed the area was haunted by bad spirits. She said Thabo was with his girlfriend before he killed himself. “We heard that during the night he asked his girlfriend to go and call his friend, who also lives in the area. When the girlfriend returned with the friend, they found Thabo hanging from the roof of his shack,” she said. “He used to live with his relative but we haven’t seen that person for a long time.” She said they don’t know how Thabo will be buried as they couldn’t trace his relative. “We appeal to anyone who might assist with burial expenses to come forward,” she said. Another resident, Sithembiso Dube (36), said they were worried because the three men didn’t leave notes to explain what led them to take their lives. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest docket was opened at Ntuzuma cop shop after the a body of a man was found hanging in his shack on Impala Road.
