PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is concerned about the small turnout of young people during youth activities. She visited Mankweng, outside Polokwane, Limpopo yesterday, where the elderly came out in large numbers, but there was a small turnout of young people. “It is my concern that the turnout of young people in this hall is so small when this outreach is directed at them,” she said. This came after several investigations into complaints of alleged breaches of the code of ethics by executive members of government in the country. She will advise the executive members on how to avoid the legislature being misled and how to resist enriching themselves or benefitting from illegal activities. Executive members from Limpopo were led by the deputy Sspeaker of the legislature, Jerry Ndou. Ndou said people should celebrate the lives of young people such as Peter Mokaba. South African Human Rights Commission provincial manager Victor Mavhidula said they would always hold the executivs liable. “We will engage with the police if any criminal incidents are suspected to have taken place,” he said. Provincial youth ambassador Tadiwanashe Chituni said the world should be in young people’s hands, but they needed older people to provide direction.
