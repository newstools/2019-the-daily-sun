NOT all mothers are clued up about diarrhoea and what it can do to children. Educating Mzansi mothers about the illness cannot be left to the government alone. Companies and health experts also need to step in to provide workshops to ensure mothers and their new babies are not affected by diarrhoea. This is why Dettol has joined hands with Mpilo Mobile and the department of health to offer hygiene education to women. Globally, diarrhoea kills about 525 000 children under the age of five every year. While in Mzansi it accounts for 2% of the deaths of children in the same age group. Lungi Mnyamana, marketing manager for the antiseptic, said their vision is to reach out to every woman in Mzansi. “Our journey with the Dettol Pop -Up Clinic programme started last month. “We hope to see every single woman getting educated about diarrhea.” Lungi said hygiene in the first 1 000 days of a child’s life is vital for survival. because are the ones who doing the cleaning at home and also to encourage their children while still young to do a proper handwashing with water and soap. Lungi said the aim is to take this initiative to every province in Mzansi. They want to reach out to as many women as possible, especially those living in areas where there’s a shortage of clean water like informal settlements and rural areas. The hygienic company will also introduce the New Moms Hospital programme. Before the women get educated about diarrhoea, their blood pressure gets measured, they are tested for diabetes and their weight is checked, too. The Moms Hospital programme aims to teach new mothers helpful hygiene tips like handwashing, surface cleaning, food handling and the general care of their babies. The aim is to ensure no child dies of a preventable disease in Mzansi.
