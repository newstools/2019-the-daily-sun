It’s vital to lend a helping hand to create job opportunities for unemployed people. This is because government alone can’t succeed in providing all the jobs needed. The high unemployment rate in the country is not only our government’s problem. It’s our problem too, as a nation, because it affects all of us. It has a negative impact on our lives. All of us, especially entrepreneurs, must come up with plans that will enable us to create jobs. We should all come up with various initiatives to assist in any way. The unemployed also have to think differently in this tough environment. People should use their skills to try and provide themselves with a means to survive. Those who have the passion to start their own small businesses must go for it. Skilled people should also share their knowledge with young people. Creating more job opportunities will reduce the rate of unemployment in the country. If we can all take part in creating jobs, we will go a long way towards building a better future. Rockville, Hebron
