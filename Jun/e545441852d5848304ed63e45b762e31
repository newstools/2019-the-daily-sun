TWO suspects were bust after five cow carcasses were found in the back of their bakkie at Shawela Village outside Tzaneen on Saturday. The men, aged 29 and 41, are thought to be part of a stock theft syndicate which had been terrorising the farmers in Bolobedu and Tzaneen, Limpopo, for months. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “The suspects were travelling in a bakkie allegedly loaded with the carcasses of five cattle. “Two other suspects managed to run away but they were identified. “The driver and owner of the vehicle were bust on the spot.” Ngoepe said through preliminary investigations, cops managed to find the stock owners who identified their cattle through their brand marks. “The two suspects will appear in the Bolobedu Magistrates Court soon. “A manhunt for the remaining suspects is still underway. “We are calling on anyone with information which could lead to their arrest to contact the CrimeStop number 0860 010111, or their nearest police station,” he said. Their actions angered residents who went on the rampage and burned down three houses believed to belong to the suspects.
