THE Automobile Association (AA) unaudited month-end fuel price
data released by the Central Energy Fund indicates that the price of petrol
will drop by 86 cents a litre. “Lower international oil prices throughout June have set up
a substantial fuel price drop for July, and the reduction could have been
greater had it not been for the Rand,” the AA said. While the price of diesel will drop by 68 cents and illuminating
paraffin by 58 cents next month. According to the AA, June was the weakest month for oil in
the last quarter, with crude briefly slipping below $60 to the barrel at
mid-month. However, renewed tensions in the Middle East and a downturn
in USA oil inventories have put pressure on the commodity, which has ticked up
over the past few days. Meanwhile, on the home front, a damaging spat over the
mandate of the Reserve Bank sent jitters through investment markets. In the wake of the row, the Rand's daily exchange rate against
the US dollar spiked by more than 60 cents. The AA said the prime driver of fuel price movements for the
third quarter of 2019 is likely to be the oil price. The Association says current tensions between the USA and
Iran could have severe consequences.
