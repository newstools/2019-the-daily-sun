ANGRY villagers from Ludeke Mission in Mbizana marched to the Mbizana Magistrates Court yesterday. They went to oppose the bail of a 23-year-old man accused of raping a 69-year-old woman last month. According to the victim’s family, the man broke into the gogo’s house on 20 May. He allegedly raped her continuously, only taking breaks to tell the gogo, who lives alone, to take a bath. A family member told Daily Sun the man eventually fell asleep and the gogo was able to escape. “The boy was arrested two weeks later. We have no place for rapists in our village. My aunt was traumatised and we had to move her to another place.” Resident Ntombekhaya Mhlelembana said they have had enough of being victims. “We appeal to the court not to give this man bail. He has not shown remorse for what he’s done. Some people have come forward to say he’s been terrorising them too.” Other community members vowed to take the law into their own hands if the accused was released. The bail application was postponed to 2 July. Police spokesman Captain Jackson Manatha said the suspects are aged 19 and 20. He said the elderly women went outside to relieve herself when the incident took place. He said the men were seen by a witness who called for help. He said the suspects were caught by residents. “The police were called and the suspects arrested. They will appear before the Willowvale Magistrates Court today on a charge of rape,” he said.
