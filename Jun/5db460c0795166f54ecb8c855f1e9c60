ARNOLD Mulaudzi this week said the postponements in his case were draining him financially. The Pro-Makhado Demarcation Task Team executive member was arrested on election day last month for allegedly going against the electoral code. Mulaudzi appeared in the Vuwani Magistrates Court on Monday, only to hear his case had been postponed to 26 July. The R5 000 bail he was granted during his first appearance was extended. Mulaudzi said he was worried about the toll the case was taking on his finances. “I’ve said it before. This case is politically motivated. “They’re just trying to demoralise me and the community. “I still maintain I did nothing wrong, but now I have to regularly attend court,” he said. “I have lost a lot of money on transport and my own time. The legal team needs to be paid every time they appear on my behalf.” Mulaudzi said it had become the norm in the country’s legal system for small cases to take a very long time.
