AFTER NELLY Khumalo went missing, a man called her family with a series of clues. Nelly (47) from Ekangala in Tshwane went missing on 2 June. The family told Daily Sun they got a call from a man, directing them to a store in Bronkhorstspruit where they’d find a map and Nelly’s ID in her bag. Another call followed, telling them where her body was. On Monday, they found Nelly’s decaying body in the bush in Secunda, Mpumalanga. The family suspected her boyfriend of the murder. Nelly’s daughter Ntsoaki Mahlangu (31) told Daily Sun they wanted him to tell them why he killed his mum. “We found her naked body. I screamed as I was not brave enough to see her dead.” They think Nelly was killed elsewhere and dumped in the bush. Her mum Sarah Skhosana (71) said: “The family is shocked and wants justice.” Her other daughter, Nomvula Mahlangu (29), said they survived on a grant. The family appealed for help with Nelly’s burial at Cullinan Cemetery on Sunday. Sergeant Doctor Sibeko said: “A body was found at Kortlaagte Farm in Secunda with a stab wound to the head. The legs and fingers were eaten, we suspect by wild animals. “It seems the woman had been dead for about four days.” Investigations continue.
