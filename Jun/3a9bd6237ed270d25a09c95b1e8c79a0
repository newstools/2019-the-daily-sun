MBALI Mazibuko made a lot of mistakes in her life, but on Friday night she did something that cost her her life. Mbali of Dube Hostel in Soweto was stabbed to death after she kicked over a glass of whisky by mistake. Trouble started after the 25-year-old was picked up by a friend to go to her boyfriend’s house. While there Mbali accidentally spilled a glass of whisky and apologised but things spun out of control, according to her cousin Slindile Khubeka. The friend’s boyfriend allegedly followed Mbali, tapped her on the shoulder and stabbed her in the chest as she turned around. Slindile said: “She came a few hours later to tell me Mbali had been stabbed. She said Mbali was still breathing when she left the scene.” Mbali had already died when Slindile arrived. Mbali’s friend Thandeka Khumalo said when she heard what had happened, she rushed to the scene and covered the body with a blanket. “I shook her, hoping she would wake up,” she said. Thandeka said she had spent the day with Mbali, who had told her she didn’t want to drink that night. Slindile said she heard Lethiwe had fled the area, but she wanted her to come back. “I want her to come back because I think she’s hiding something,” she said. Police said a suspect was arrested over the weekend and appeared in the Protea Magistrates Court on Monday. He will appear again on Wednesday next week.
