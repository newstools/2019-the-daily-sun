MZANSI’s cops may soon be wearing body cameras while crime
busting. This is according to a report by BusinessTech. The publication says a department of police spokesperson
said that the body cameras are on the agenda of the SAPS’ top management but no
implementation date has been set. As soon as funding is confirmed the project will start
according to the source. “Body cameras will be used as – but not limited to – a
safety measure to protect our men and woman in blue during operations,” the
spokesperson said. “They will also be used for data capturing as the world is
moving in the direction of the 4th industrial revolution and to advance
policing. “I can’t give the exact date of implementation unfortunately
for now, due to the allocation of funds etc.” In March this year BusinessTech reported that the Joburg
Metro Police Department (JMPD) 
introduced ‘body lights’ which closely resemble the sirens attached to
emergency vehicles. The lights will be worn by all officers involved in traffic
management, as well as any who conduct roadblock and stop searches, ultimately
making up a large proportion of the JMPD force. Joburg Public Safety spokesperson, Luyanda Longwe, said that
the lights will be attached to an officer’s shoulder and will flash red and
blue.
