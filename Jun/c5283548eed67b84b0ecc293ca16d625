An
induction session at the Old Assembly in Parliament on Wednesday turned into a fight
between ANC and EFF MPs. The
situation was reportedly defused by an angry Speaker Thandi Modise. In a video
of the incident, a group of at least seven EFF MPs can be seen in front of the
ANC's benches pushing other MPs around and waving their arms. News24 reported that the confrontation was alleged instigated by EFF members. DA MP
Annelie Lotriet, who chaired the session to introduce new and returning MPs to
the mechanics of legislating and lawmaking, said EFF MP Makoti Khawula had used
the opportunity to taunt and attack the ANC. "She
repeatedly attacked the ANC and accused them of electing criminals to
Parliament. This obviously led to ANC MPs becoming riled up. When one of the
ANC MPs started responding to her, I asked for calm and tried to explain that
the purpose of the session is to talk about lawmaking. "Suddenly
another EFF MP, Tebogo Mokwele, jumped up, took the microphone and started
shouting at the ANC, ignoring the chair and started marching across to the ANC
benches, followed by some EFF MPs. That's when the fight broke out,"
Lotriet told News24.
