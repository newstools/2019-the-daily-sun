MANCHESTER City boss Pep Guardiola has refuted rumours he is considering taking a sabbatical from football at the end of next season. Guardiola has just led City to a domestic treble, and reports have claimed the Spaniard could take a sabbatical if he guides his side to Uefa Champions League glory next year. Guardiola has had an extended break before, enjoying a year off after leaving Barcelona before taking over at Bayern Munich in 2013. Yet with two years remaining on his contract at the Etihad Stadium, the 48-year-old insists such thoughts are not in his mind. Speaking to media at a golf event in Spain, Guardiola said, in quotes carried by Marca: “No. I do not take sabbatical years. “I am young and I have desire. The news comes out and many things are not true. “If they do not kick me out, I’ll stay there.” Guardiola also emphatically denied speculation linking him with Juventus last month, and is determined to win Europe’s top prize with City. “We all want to win the Champions League because it is the most beautiful thing. “The important thing is to try again and in our case we will do it again,” he said. “If we fail, we will try again, as the important thing is to be there until the end.” – SPORT24
