Five men were arrested at the Westonaria industrial area for
possession of copper cable. Captain PJ Conradie from Westonaria spotted an empty building
while he was busy with his daily routine duties at one of the
scrap metal dealers, at the industrial area. The Captain reportedly heard strange noises nearby and saw people
busy inside the empty building stripping copper cable. He immediately called for backup, and while he was waiting for
backup he drove around the building to the main gate and saw the suspects
jumping over the wall. The suspects were then arrested, they will appear at Westonaria
Magistrate Court soon. The West Rand District Commissioner, Major General PF Kekana welcomed
the arrest and commended the cops for their good work. “Copper cable theft in the Westrand District is a concern and we
will continue addressing it and make sure that suspects are brought to book and
face the full might of the law. We are making a clarion call to the community to be active
participants by providing information on any lawlessness to the police,” Kekana.
