MARRIED women try to ensure they have all they need in their homes. But women of the Masibambane stokvel don’t do it alone. The women, from kasis such as Khayelitsha, Nyanga, Philippi, Gugulethu and Mfuleni, have joined hands to help each other. The stokvel was founded by Viwe Mkhaliphi (37) in 2017. She said they each contributed R500 every month during their monthly meetings. “We have 37 members. It’s not only about buying the things we need, but we also buy members birthday presents based on their needs,” she said. Viwe said they ensured every member had quality products. “Our husbands are shocked whenever they hear how expensive they are. “Buying cheap things would mean we will continue to buy the same things after a few years.” Zoleka Jani (40) said she learnt about the group on Facebook after seeing photos of the women in their uniform. She inquired about it and joined them.
