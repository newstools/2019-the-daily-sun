AFTER falling short on his quest to be crowned International Boxing Organisation (IBO) cruiserweight world champion Vasil Ducar stole the show when he proposed to his girlfriend Irena Vojackova and she said yes. The Czech Republican opponent who was challenging the South African champion Kevin Lerena’s IBO belt wasted no after the ring announcer Duncan Pollock declared him a loser to steal the thunder under Lerena’s nose. He went down on his knees asking his girlfriend of more than two years her hand in marriage and she accepted the proposal in front of the cheering crowd. The seven fight novice who is a policeman in his home country lost his world title challenge but won his partner’s heart forever. According to the former Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter contesting for a world title was special achievement for him and he wanted his proposal to be part of that. “Fighting for a world title is a dream comes true, this was a special night and I wanted it to be a special moment for us by proposing. We have been together for two and half years we will remember this night for the rest of our lives. Even I have lost this title challenge to her I have won,” he said. The 29 year old visitor said he was bit nervous because he did not know if his girlfriend will say yes to a loser. Although Ducar did not stay longer in Mzansi shores he enjoyed his stay in South Africa and getting another fight opportunity he would definitely come back. “It was not an easy fight I did my best and I’m proud of my performance. South Africans are amazing people and warm welcoming given another opportunity I will definitely come back,” he said. Ducar’s record dropped to seven wins, one defeat and a draw.
