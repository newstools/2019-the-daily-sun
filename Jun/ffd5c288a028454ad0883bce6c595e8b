SIZZLING hot temperatures have forced Stuart Baxter to change Bafana Bafanaâ€™s programme. Bafana are in Dubai preparing for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals in Egypt. They were scheduled to leave for Egypt on Monday, following their practice friendly against Ghana on Saturday. But Baxter have decided the team will travel to Cairo on Sunday. He has explained that leaving early will give his team more time to prepare for the Angola, to be played either in Cairo or Suez, on Wednesday. Kick off for the Ghana friendly has been moved from 3pm to 5.30pm due to rising temperatures. South Africa will open their Afcon campaign against Ivory Coast on 24 June, take on Namibian four days later, before they tackle Morocco in their last group D fixture on 1 July in Cairo.
