MBORO has declared war on witchcraft! “I am going to destroy those who rise every morning to destroy the lives of the children of God,” said Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng of the Incredible Happenings Ministries. Mboro has embarked on a two-week crusade called Destruction of Witchcraft, which will continue until 16 June. “Witches belong to the Kingdom of Darkness and I shall pray and destroy them in the name of Jesus,” Mboro said. “It’s very sad that people rejoice at destroying the lives of others.” Mboro has been holding sermons and all night prayers. He said: “God will give me prophetic instructions on how to deal with every case of witchcraft. I will step on it as we pray, and they will take it back to their homes.” He said over the years he has come across many cases of witchcraft. “Sometimes medical doctors are unable to diagnose a patient simply because they are spiritually unwell.” He said he didn’t intend naming and shaming anyone. “They will reveal themselves and confess their evil deeds,” he said.
