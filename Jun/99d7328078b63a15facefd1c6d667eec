ARE you looking for a new car? All you have to do is to buy a pair of takkies! But there’s a catch. The takkies cost R365 900! And you’ll have to hurry as the range is limited to only 80 pairs. The new range was unveiled by Bathu founder Theo Baloyi in a video on YouTube last Tuesday. Theo said the shoes would be the most expensive sold in Mzansi. The only thing different about them is a GSi logo, and that you could walk away with the new Opel Corsa GSi. According to the company’s website, the car costs R365 900 and only 80 models will be making it to South Africa. But it seems SunReaders don’t mind the big price tag. They said they would buy the shoes if they came with a little something extra. - Dumisani Majobe said: “If they can walk me straight to heaven, I can.” - Malesela WA Ga Kekana said: “If those shoes cook, clean, and iron, I won’t mind buying them.” - Gift Dallas said: “I can buy them if they can turn into all sorts of shoes I want.”
