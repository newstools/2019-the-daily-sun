An Australian airline is coming to SA and will release a few discounted First Class seats listing them on Airbnb as bookable accommodation. Some of the tickets will go for as little as R300 bucks or less, says Business Insider AUS. According to Business Insider Australia, Qantas hasn’t revealed exactly how many of the bargain tickets are being released, but it says there will be “dozens of flights across the Qantas International network including London, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Santiago, and more.” But there are some restrictions! No pets and no parties. We don’t know about you, but we always love a good #viewfromawindow at sunset. Where are you #flying to this week? ??: @krazy_i A post shared by  Qantas (@qantas) on May 21, 2019 at 11:09pm PDT
