THE newly appointed uMshwathi mayor has vowed to ensure his municipality remains corruption free. Mayor Mandla Zondi promised to intensify the fight against corruption so residents’ needs could be fulfilled. Zondi’s election came after the previous mayor, Siphindile Zondi-Mbhele, died of a heart attack in February. Speaking after his swearing in, Zondi committed himself to running a clean municipality. “The late mayor’s shoes are the hardest to fill because she made sure everything ran smoothly and people’s needs were a top priority. We can’t ruin what she started. “She lit the candle for all of us. So our duty is to ensure the light never burns out. We need to work together to ensure we meet residents’ needs at all times as she did,” said Zondi. He invited municipal staff to work with him to ensure service delivery remained a top priority. “I request all of you to join forces with me in this drive to a better future,” he said. New Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sipho Hlomuka congratulated Zondi. “I’m happy the new mayor has committed the department to working hand in hand with the municipality to ensure significant service delivery gains made by the municipality are continued,” said Hlomuka.
