GOGO Gladys Ncedani couldn’t hold back her tears when telling the SunTeam about her struggles while living in a rundown rondavel. The 62-year-old and her four grandchildren from Viedgiesville near Mthata were left with nothing after a huge storm in 2017. Gogo said one of her rondavels was completely destroyed and the remaining one leaked when it rained. But Human Settlements MEC Nonkqubela Peters heard her cries during a visit to the area on Wednesday and promised the gogo would get an RDP house before the end of next month. Contractors were already starting preparations for the new house. The gogo said: “I’m happy I will get a house because I tried my best to mend the holes but my money was running out. “It’s really hard living here. We use this rondavel for sleeping and as our kitchen. People came in 2017 to take photos but we never saw them again.” Peters said they would rearrange the housing lists to give priority to child-headed families, people with disabilities and those living in deep poverty. She said other victims of the storm would also be given houses. “Local municipalities will help us with the list. “We hired a contractor from a nearby village to help this family,” she said. The MEC called on others in similar situations to ask their ward committees to take up their cases with their municipalities.
