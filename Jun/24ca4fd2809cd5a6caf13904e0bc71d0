VELISWA Sondamase is tired of being sent from pillar to post. When her epilepsy disability grant was cancelled in 2012 without explanation, Sassa officials in North West told her to go to the Eastern Cape office where she had first applied. “I explained that I didn’t have transport money to go there. I also told them I didn’t know anyone there since my mum died. But they insisted,” she said. Her husband Sibusiso Mndaweni (35) said he was forced to quit his job in 2013 to take care of Veliswa, who had epileptic seizures. It was only after pressure was applied on the North West office that she was allowed to reapply. But she still doesn’t receive a disability grant. Last month, Veliswa went back to Sassa’s North West office with blood results from Odi Hospital. But the agency’s doctor apparently told her she was fit for work. Sassa regional spokeswoman Nthabiseng Mosieleng said: “She recently applied for a disability grant and it was not approved. “The agency has a process a client can follow if she’s not happy with the outcome of an application. “She’s still within the stipulated time frame of 90 days since her last application was made last month. “These processes are clearly outlined in the outcome letter that she received when her application was not approved. “Sassa officials are trained to assist clients to apply for these mechanisms.” Veliswa received a disability grant between 2009 and 2011.
