TWO illegal traditional surgeons will apply for bail next week. Lizalise Ndevu (20) and Masande Mtete (35) were bust for illegally circumcising underage boys. They appeared in the Tsolo Magistrates Court yesterday. Ndevu was arrested on Saturday after he unlawfully circumcised 17-year-old twins from Lucingweni Village in Tsolo. One of the initiates died, while another was admitted to hospital. Mtete illegally circumcised a seven-year-old boy. Ndevu told the court he could only afford R500 bail. He said he had no previous convictions and pending cases against him. But the state opposed his bail, needing to verify his address and get his profile. His bail application will be heard next Tuesday. Mtete’s bail application could not be heard as the court had to deal with other matters. He will be back in court on 1 July for a formal bail application. Nkosi Mkhanyiseli Dudumayo, chairtman of the OR Tambo initiation forum, welcomed the arrests. “It’s clear government takes the killing of children by people who call themselves traditional surgeons seriously. The justice system must play its course. If we had the power, we would call for life sentences for the culprits,” he said.
