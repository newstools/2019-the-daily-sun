NOMSA Jack is gatvol of people using her yard as a dumpsite. “I have been living this hell of a life for many years,” the 49-year-old from Soweto-on-Sea in Nelson Mandela Bay told Daily Sun. “The municipal refuse trucks couldn’t pass through other streets because they are too small. It was then decided they would collect the area’s rubbish outside my house, which is on the corner of a bigger street. “But people have just turned my yard into a dump because they drop rubbish here every day of the week, not just on collection day.” She said it took away her dignity. “In January, people burnt a heap of rubbish here, which threatened my home. “They dump everything from used pads and nappies to branches and rags. Two weeks ago, a man was beaten by the community and dumped here. Luckily, he was found before he died but he died later in hospital.” Nomsa said her councillor was aware of the situation. “I have nowhere to go. This is my house and I survive on piece jobs. I live here with my 27-year-old son,” she said. Neighbour Andiswa Mahomba (37) said the problem had been going on for 10 years. “People from other areas are the main cause of the problem,” he said. Councillor Zoliswa Dlula said the municipality had a plan to resolve refuse collection in the area.
