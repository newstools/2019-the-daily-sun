NOTHING hurts like a broken heart! But it’s even more painful when you don’t see it coming or learn about it for the first time on social media. Daily Sun asked SunReaders if they’ve experienced the same thing or if they’ve ever been dumped unexpectedly. Marriage counsellor Pastor John Nzimande told the People’s Paper that break-ups can be very depressing, especially when the other party isn’t expecting it. “Before you leave someone, think of what it would feel like if it was you being dumped like that,” said Pastor John. He said there were signs to look out for, such as your partner trying not to spend time with you. “They won’t communicate like they used to. They become easily irritated,” he said. He said one shouldn’t ignore the signs, but ask for explanations.
