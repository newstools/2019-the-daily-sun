PERCY Tau has taken a critical look at Bafana Bafana’s woeful start to the Africa Cup of Nations.Not for the first time, South Africa find themselves on a back-foot early in the major tournament. Even though their 1-0 loss to Ivory Coast wasn’t entirely unexpected, a draw, however, would have been a better result for Bafana. Bafana are now bottom of the group D, equal with Namibia on one point, with Ivory Coast and Morocco joint top on three. Tau has been critical of his team’s performance, admitting they could have done better.“I think if we had got our attack better‚ got our attack proper‚ because we have a decent attack‚ it was going to be better,” Tau said. “We couldn’t get in the game. And this was the first match - I think in the second match we'll see a lot of improvement from ourselves‚ and from myself also. I know I couldn't get in the match.” A lot is expected from Tau in the tournament after his breakthrough season with Belgian club Saint Gilloise. But pressure is mounting on Bafana coach Stuart Baxter, who came into the tournament already under fire. Now they have to win against Namibia on Friday or start packing their bags. Added Tau: “Like I say‚ if we got our plan right it was going to be a different story against Ivory Coast. We have to beat them.”
