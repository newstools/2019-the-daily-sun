RESIDENTS of Alexandra township were left stranded on Wednesday morning as
the #Alexshutdown protest got underway. The organisers of the protest say they will be marching to the city’s
regional offices in Sandton. The protesting Alex residents blocked major routes in the Kasi, which
led to traffic disruptions. The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) say the strike is
illegal as there isn’t a permit issued for the strike. JMPD says it will however escort the March that has been planned to
Sandton for safety reasons.
