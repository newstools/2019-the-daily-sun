ORLANDO Pirates have released three more players as they continue to make space for new-recruits. The latest to get off the Buccaneers ship are goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane as well as midfielders, Ayanda Nkosi and Thabo Qalinge. The clear-out is anticipation of the imminent arrival of Maritzburg United duo of Siphesihle Ndlovu and Fortune Makaringe, among other recruits. The trio’s departure, however, follows that of Abbubaker Mobara, who has joined Cape Town City. The club had been torn between releasing either Mabokgwane or Siyabonga Mpontshane. It is unclear where the trio is headed, though Mabokgwane has already been linked a move to the Citizens as well. He hardly played last season, having spent long period on the sidelines nursing a broken finger. “Holiday season is over and it is time to knuckle down to the serious business of the season ahead. As with every season, June is the time of the month when players’ contracts are set to expire at all levels within the organization,” the club said. For the Reserve teams and lower divisions, the club have also release the following players; Reanetse Ramatlapeng, Katleho Molaba, Samuel Nkomo, Phumulani Masinga, Phila Mzila, Reanetse Ramatlapeng, Ricardo Lourenco, Riyaaz Nell, Tebogo Ngwenya, Rodi Sibanda, Lucky Mdingi and Zaahir Witbooi.
