WHEN the traffic cops stopped a speeding grey Polo TSI with no registration, all they wanted to do was to issue a traffic fine. But the cops based in Grobelersdal didn't know they have stopped criminals. The two officers were robbed of their phones, a speed camera and a gun. It's further alleged that they were on duty along the Slaagboom public road near Marble Hall doing their day to day job conducting the speed trap. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe the spokesman for Limpopo Police said the traffic cops stopped the car which exceeded the speed limit and there wereÂ  five occupants in it. "While they were busy issuing the driver with a traffic fine, three passengers two of them armed with rifles and the other one with a pistol got out of the car. They robbed both the Traffic Police Officers of their two cellphones, one firearm and the speed camera before they fled the scene. These suspects are still unknown and they are still at large." Ngoepe said. Ngoepe has pleaded with anyone with information that can help the police arrests the suspects to contact Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501 or the nearest Police Station.
