BAROKA FC boss Khurishi Mphahlele has revealed that they are targeting a top eight finish next season. This after they survived relegation by skin of the teeth, where they ended third bottom on the log. “Last season I saw a lot of improvement from the team, and we want to build from that next season,” said Mphahlele. “We are going to retain the whole technical team. We need continuinity. Baroka have grown from a semi-professional to a full-professional team. We aim go strong from here and compete.” Despite the struggle in their league campaign last season, the Ga-Mphahlele based side made history by lifting the Telkom Knockout under coach Wedson Nyirenda. Meanwhile, so far, Baroka have signed Malawian international Richard Mpuli on a three-year deal. Mphahlele said they are not yet ready to reveal names of players who will be released, as he is still awaiting the return of their coach later this month. “The players are still on holiday and I don’t want to worry them about their future. I want them to relax,” said Mphahlele. Baroka, who will host Under-21 trials, will report back in camp on 10 June.
