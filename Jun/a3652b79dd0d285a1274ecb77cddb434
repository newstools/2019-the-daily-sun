FOR 20 years Ntombomzi’s lover would threaten to kill her, but she didn’t take him seriously. But on Sunday his drunken threats turned deadly – he stabbed the wrong person. “HE KILLED MY NEPHEW INSTEAD OF ME!” SHE CRIED. Speaking to Daily Sun, Ntombomzi Sadina (40) said she was sitting with her nephew and other relatives outside their shack in Daggafontein in Springs, Ekurhuleni, when her drunken lover arrived.“He told me he wanted me dead and started swearing at me,” she said. “I took it lightly because he did that when he was drunk.” But this time he meant it. He went inside the shack and came back with a knife. “He came straight for me. I saw the look on his face. He was serious,” she said. “I thought it was the end of my life. I dived down, and at that moment I heard the sound of the knife going into my nephew’s chest.” Bakhona Ngqaza (35), who was standing behind Ntombomzi, screamed in pain. As she ran away she heard him scream, “He stabbed me! He stabbed me!” Then he stopped screaming. The man fled the squatter camp and was arrested yesterday in Springs. Captain Johannes Ramphora said the suspect was due to appear in the Springs Magistrates Court on a murder charge. Ntombomzi said she wanted the suspect to spend the rest of his life in jail. “He suffers from epilepsy and I fear he might use it in court to get released.” She said she felt guilty that an innocent person died for her. “I wish it could have been me. I’m carrying the guilt because Bakhona died for me. “I don’t know how to face our relatives. Some people are saying that if it wasn’t for me, Bakhona would still be alive.” She said she can’t sleep at night because the images of Bakhona keep running through her mind. “I wish I could wake him up,” she said. Bakhona’s sister Noluthando Paulos said what happened was tragic and they wished they could get it all behind them. The family is shaken. “It’s going to take time,” she said.
