WALTER Sisulu University was closed after students apparently torched three cars at the Zamukulungisa site in Mthatha on Monday. Captain Dineo Koena said: “A 27-year-old man was arrested after he was caught by security guards.” University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said students at Zamukulungisa had been boycotting lectures for days. “They threw petrol bombs at security officials, leading to closure of the campus with immediate effect. “All students were ordered to go home.” A VW Kombi and Caddy, as well as a Corolla, were allegedly torched by students demanding NSFAS payments. Tukwayo said management had a temporary court interdict preventing students from entering the site. She said eviction of students from university premises, with the help of police and security guards, had also been approved. One student said they should be writing mid-year exams. “Some of us come from far away and have nowhere to go.” SRC spokesman Asanda Mtshezi said management must give students allowances. “We need to continue our studies. We’re very late,” said Mtshezi. She had no idea who burnt the cars. The suspect will appear in court soon.
