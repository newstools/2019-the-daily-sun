MISS Mamelodi Sundowns 2019 Faith Nonyane said she is lucky to be alive! This is after the 24-year-old was robbed in Muckleneuk, Tshwane, last Wednesday. She said she heard a loud bang and when she looked back, a thug was almost in her car. She told Daily Sun the thug stole R1 000 she was going to deposit at the bank for her brother to register at university. The thug also took her cellphone, bank cards, ID, wallet and an Apple watch. Faith said she watched helplessly as the thug fled with her belongings. “I’m concerned people will not be able to get hold of me,” said Faith. “I was traumatised and scared at the same time.” Faith said the incident happened as she was preparing to travel to Qatar, where she is going to learn more about non-profit organisations. She flew to Qatar on Friday morning and will be back on 6 July. Pretoria Central police spokesman Constable Thabang Nkhumise told the People’s Paper: “A case of theft out of motor vehicle was opened.” He said valuables were stolen and investigations were underway.
