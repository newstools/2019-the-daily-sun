Renault is adding more flair to its range-topping Sandero Stepway Plus! The Sandero Stepway Plus has an enhanced style and better features. Since the launch of the first-generation Sandero in 2009, the brand has continued to enjoy ever-increasing success and sales of over 58 000 units to date. Especially the flagship Stepway model, which has proven to be an extremely popular choice with sales in excess of 26 000 cars since its introduction in 2011. Celebrating its marked success, Renault is introducing the new enhanced Sandero Stepway Plus, replacing the current flagship model.  The design of the Sandero Stepway Plus is distinguished by its gloss black side mirrors with a red line. It’s available in three colours: fusion red, highland silver and cafe brown. The overall design is boosted by Renault’s C-shaped LED daytime running light with C-shaped rear tail lights. An integrated roof spoiler, roof rails, front and rear skid plates, fog lights, wheel arch mouldings and a raised ride height add to its muscular appearance. The Sandero Stepway Plus is well-equipped. The seats boast a new fabric design. It also gets the latest touchscreen multimedia system for Apple Carplay or Aindroid Auto.  Safety is catered for by ABS brakes with EBD and several airbags. The car is still powered by Renault’s efficient 0,9 litre turbo engine with 66kW of power. The claimed average fuel usage is 5,4-litres/100km. Adding to the Sandero Stepway Plus’ appealing package is a five-year/150 000km warranty, together with a standard two-year/30 000km service plan.
