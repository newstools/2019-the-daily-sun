11 June 2019 marks exactly nine years since Siphiwe Tshabalala scored that memorable opening goal of the 2010 FIFA World Cup which was hosted in South Africa. Tshabalala will go down in history as the first player to score the opening goal of the only World Cup hosted on African soil, a scorcher against Mexico at a packed FNB Stadium. This day has since been dubbed "Shabba Day!" The former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder took to social media to reflect on what he has previously described as "the most special moment of my life." On this day 11 June 2010???? Happy #shabbaday A post shared by  Siphiwe Tshabalala (@siphiweshabba) on Jun 10, 2019 at 11:35pm PDT
