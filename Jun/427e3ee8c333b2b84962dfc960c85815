THIRTEEN school kids across Gauteng  are facing different criminal charges for various crimes committed outside school premises. This is according to Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi who was speaking at the memorial service of Forest High School pupil, Daniel Bakwela. The revelation was prompted by the bombshell dropped by the National Prosecuting Authority after they stated that the deceased 16-year-old pupil, was due to appear in court in August for armed robbery. Addressing scores of mourning leaners, Lesufi said, “I’m was also shocked when the NPA indicated that there are learners who are supposed to appear in court. “We instructed the department officials to go to all courts (in Gauteng), to establish the number of learners that are charged and the number of leaners that are about to appear in court. “And I am ashamed that as I’m speaking to you now, there are 13 school children across the province that are appearing in court for various crimes that they have committed outside the school’s premises,” he said. Lesufi said the department is now looking at amendments in terms of pupil discipline. This is to include a regulation that forces all pupils that are appearing in court to declare to the department if they are appearing in court and the department can take appropriate steps against them. “If you are appear in court and you didn’t declare, it must be an offence and we must institute disciplinary hearing against you.” Lesufi added, “We are also working together with the courts, so that the courts’ system our system can communicate so that when a learner is appearing, we can pick up id number so that we can know whether a leaner is appearing or not.” The MEC also pleaded with the leaners to respect their teachers, and not to bring weapons at school.
