RAJESH Sundaram regrets helping the Guptas set up their television station in the country. The former ANN7 editor told the Zondo commission yesterday that former president Jacob Zuma was actively involved in setting up of the channel. He said Zuma even suggested names of journalists, including the kids of ANC comrades, who could be employed. He said he left the channel because he realised the Guptas wanted a rubber stamp. “They didn’t care about the content. They wanted to make profits as soon as possible to channel dividends to stakeholders.” He said Zuma did not take the Waterkloof Air Force base scandal seriously. “In the three meetings with Zuma that I was part of, the brothers joked occasionally about the scandal, as if nothing had happened.” Sundaram told the commission he was surprised that his visa to come to Mzansi was done in a day. “Coming from India, I found it funny that the president would dedicate two hours of his time to a new station that has not even started yet. I thought Atul Gupta was exaggerating,” he said.
