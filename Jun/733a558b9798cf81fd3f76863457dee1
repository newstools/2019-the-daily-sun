THABO Malokasi has found entertaining motorists is a great way to get work. The 34-year-old single father from Phase 6 in Mangaung, in the Free State, dances on the side of the road – acting out cutting the lawn, painting and laying bricks – to attract job offers. “Motorists love what I do. I even get tips sometimes. Getting a job is hard enough and no one picks you up for a piece job when you are just sitting down as if you’re tired,” he said. “I decided to demonstrate my skills by adding dance moves so people can see the energy I have. I have been unemployed and standing on the side of the road for seven years. For the past four years, I have been dancing and motorists don’t mind picking me.” This helps Thabo to fend for his six-year-old son, with whom he lives. “Some people say I’m crazy, but it works for me. I have a talent for dancing, cleaning and fixing things around the house. I am just fusing them together to help market myself better,” he said. “What makes me happy is to see people smiling in their cars while I do my dance moves. My advice to job seekers is to show energy to potential employers. I always tell my employers they should fire me if I don’t deliver what I demonstrate on the road.”
