BUSISIWE Masilela came up with the plan for a drum majorettes group to fight teenage pregnancy in her village. The 38-year-old from Ga-Phaahla in Siyabuswa, Mpumalanga, has recruited 36 girls aged between eight and 18 for the Makgobolanakga Drum Majorettes. Busisiwe said the number will grow, judging from the support she gets from parents. She said they practise in her yard for two hours every day and get help with their schoolwork. “For many years I saw young girls becoming pregnant at a very young age. “I used to see them roaming the streets and sitting in groups on street corners. “They have a lot of spare time and don’t know how to use it. I teach them to drum majorettes because I grew up doing it. “Children are exposed to bad things like drugs, crime and pregnancy. I want these young girls to remain virgins until they finish school. “I asked their parents to each donate R50 for uniforms. It’s still not complete, but we’ll get there.” She said forming the group has made a huge difference in the community. They get invites to perform at events and she bought drums with her own money.
