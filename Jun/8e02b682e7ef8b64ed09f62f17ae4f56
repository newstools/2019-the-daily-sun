TRANSPORT Minister Fikile Mbalula had words of comfort for the families of the 24 young people who died when their overloaded taxi collided with a bus on Sunday night. The victims, mostly high schools pupils, were from nine different villages,. The deadly taxi crash happened on the R81 between Mooketsi Village and Giyani in Limpopo. The young people were coming from Sekgosese Village after celebrating Youth Day. Mbalula met the families on Tuesday in Ga-Rapitsi Village, outside Tzaneen. He told them: “Those kids left in the morning to celebrate Youth Day but died. “Government really feels your pain. “We must come together to give them a proper send-off. This is not the time to blame the dead or point fingers. “The matter is being handled by the police and once they are finished investigating, they’ll give that report to me and we will share it with you. On Saturday, I will be here for their burial.” Mbalula said there should be a memorial at the accident scene with the names of all 24 young people who died on it. Preparations for a mass funeral are underway at the Rapitsi sports ground on Saturday.
