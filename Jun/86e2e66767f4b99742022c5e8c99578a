THE mysterious deaths of two women within days of each other was the last straw. The angry community of Barberton, Mpumalanga, could no longer fold their arms while young women were dying. So on Friday they marched to the local police station to demand that the station commander probe the two deaths. The body of Mandisa Mdhluli (25) was found hanging from the roof last Monday afternoon. Residents suspect she was murdered. Three days later, the body of Khulile Malumane (28) was found dumped at the local cemetery. Khulile’s body had multiple gunshot wounds. In August last year, a 16-year-old was raped and murdered. The accused in the case was arrested and is out on bail. The organiser of Friday’s march, Siyabonga Malandule, called on cops to conduct thorough investigations into the latest deaths. “We cannot sit and watch while young girls are being murdered,” he said “Enough is enough. The perpetrators must not be granted bail.” The marchers demanded that bail granted to the accused in the murder and rape of the 16-year-old girl be revoked. Barberton station commander Colonel Johan Engelbretch acknowledged residents’ demands and promised to give feedback within seven days.
