RESIDENTS of Phelekezela Street in Lindelani, north of Durban, are fed up. For the whole month, they have been forced to live with kak water running down their street and flowing into their yards. Residents said a sewerage pipe that burst last month hasn’t been fixed. They claim that the municipality promised to send workers to repair the pipe, but nothing happened. Resident Nomkhosi Mfeka (51) said they didn’t know what to do because the municipality was ignoring them. “Our councillor is also aware, but she can’t do anything because it’s the municipality’s responsibility to send workers.” Another resident, Nhlanhla Mkhize (45), said the kak will make them sick. “This poses a health hazard to residents, especially our kids. Nobody deserves to live under such conditions.” He said they couldn’t take it anymore and wanted the municipality to fix the burst pipe. “We’ve reported the matter several times, but nothing happened.” Ethekwini municipal spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said: “Our team has been informed to attend to the matter.” He said by the end of today the problem would be resolved. “We would like to apologise to affected residents.”
