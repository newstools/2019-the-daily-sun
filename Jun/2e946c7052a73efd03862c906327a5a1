THE Johannesburg CBD became a battlefield when cops seized fake goods from retailers. Johannesburg police came under attack on Sunday while raiding shops. Police vans were also damaged, and streets barricaded with burning plastic barriers. Cops spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the group of people identified as foreign nationals, stormed on police who were on crime prevention duty in the area. The incident reportedly happened on Rahima Moosa (previously Jeppe) and Von Wielligh streets.    Targeting #Hillbrow whilst the source of those counterfeit goods is all the china towns and oriental plazas but they wouldn't dare. Burn everything, dont be selective in whose goods you confiscate. It's a ticking time bomb against easy targets, last week it was Alexandra.
