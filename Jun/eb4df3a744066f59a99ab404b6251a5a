CALCUTTA police in Mkhuhlu are investigating a case of car hijacking and malicious damage to property. A stolen Toyota Corolla was found abadoned and burned in the bush near Hluvukani Village outside Thulamahashe on Friday. According to the cops, the car was hijacked two weeks ago in Cunningmore Village. This after a driver (30) was held at gunpoint during the night by three unknown men. Police spokeswoman Sergeant Zanele Sibuyi told Daily Sun: “On Friday we received a call from Hluvukani villagers informing us about a group of cattle herders who saw a burned car hidden in the bush. “Our team discovered that the car matched the description of the vehicle reported stolen two weeks ago.” She said no arrests have were made and appealed to anyone with information to contact Lieutenant-Colonel Dudu Shabangu on 082 469 2560 or 08600 10111. “We appeal to motorists to be careful when they drive at night as thugs can follow them until they find a spot to carry out their crimes,” said Sibuyi.
