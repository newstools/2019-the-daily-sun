KOUGA Municipality said last week its new budget will speed up service delivery. R93,11 million was budgeted for projects to uplift the people. Mayor Horatio Hendricks said these will improve sanitation, electricity and waste management. They also planned to upgrade roads and public facilities. “Waste treatment plants at Kruisfontein and Jeffreys Bay recently received major upgrades, while the upgrade of the Sea Vista Waste Water Treatment Works will be completed in the next year.” Hendricks said other projects to receive funds included the upgrades of the KwaNomzamo Waste Treatment Works and of the sanitation system in Patensie. He said R2,3 million was budgeted a year for three years to make the bucket system a thing of the past in Stofwolk in Hankey, Thornhill, Sea Vista, Ramaphosa Village, KwaNozamo and Ocean View. Hendricks said they planned to get rid of illegal electricity connections by connecting more households, while roads would be tarred. “The electricity projects are focused on Jeffreys Bay, Humansdorp, St Francis and Oyster Bay.”
