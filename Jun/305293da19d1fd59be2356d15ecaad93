Angry Alexandra residents, led by the Shutdown Movement intend
to open a case against the City's Mayor, Herman Mashaba. "Mashaba must fall" they chanted outside the
City's Regional offices in Sandton, North of Joburg on Wednesday. This was before making their way to Alexandra police
station. Earlier in the morning residents took to the streets and
barricaded roads with burning tyres. They are angered by Mashaba's promise to rebuild 80 illegal
structures that were demolished by the Red Ants last month. The leaders of the Movement accused Mashaba of prioritising
owners of illegal structures, when hundreds other residents have been waiting
for their houses since 1996. "It is clear that Mashaba doesn't take us serious. He
has once again failed to address us as residents of Alexandra. â€œWe have now decided to go and open a criminal case against
him. He has acted beyond the law," said leaders of the Movement outside
the offices. Sandile Manuela, one of the leaders said Mashaba cannot
rebuild those structures when there is a court order to have them demolished. He said: "He is acting against the court order. He
can't insist on rebuilding structures that are illegal." Earlier this month Mashaba said a court order to have the
structures demolished was obtained in 2016. He said officials responsible for
the demolishing will be held accountable.
