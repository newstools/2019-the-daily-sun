MORE charges may be added to those of two suspects, aged 54 and 65, accused of conning people in Mtubatuba, northern KZN. The suspects appeared briefly in Mtubatuba Magistrates Court on Wednesday. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele asked residents who might have been conned by the suspects to contact Mtubatuba police urgently. A gogo (77) was allegedly conned on 31 May in Mtubatuba CBD when an unknown woman touched her shoulder with a green substance. After this, a man appeared and they convinced the gogo to follow them to the car to remove bad luck and to save her money from becoming valueless. “The car then drove away with the gogo still in it. They robbed her of R500. The car lost control and the gogo was saved by police who were on duty, Mbele said. She said the cops arrested two suspects ,while the driver managed to flee the scene. A man said he was robbed of R115 000 on his way back from the bank. A woman suspect said the nearby toilets were too filthy and asked him to accompany her to relieve herself in an isolated area. “While waiting for her, a car came and the occupants robbed him R115 000 and fled the scene,” said Mbele.
