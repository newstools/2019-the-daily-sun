THE family of a woman believed to have been killed and buried in a shallow grave in 2014 want Police Minister Bheki Cele to intervene. Tholwephi Miya from Bhobhonono, Cato Ridge left home five years ago to buy stock for her business in the Durban CBD but never returned home. Her niece, Thobile Mthembu (39), said her aunt was 47 years old at the time. Thobile said on the day she went missing, Tholwephi got a call from a woman who said she would show her a shop that sold cheap second-hand clothes. “When we called our aunt later, her phone went to voicemail,” she said. She said the family looked everywhere for her, and even consulted sangomas to find out what happened. Thobile said in 2016, a suspect took the cops to a place where he and fellow suspects allegedly buried Tholwephi. “They dug at the spot he showed them but she was not found,” she said. She said the cops dug in a relative’s yard last Tuesday after another suspect allegedly confessed she was buried there, but no remains were found. She said events leading to Tholwephi’s disappearance were well-known in the area. “People are still talking but nothing is being done to find the killers. That’s why I’m calling on Cele to intervene.” She said the first suspect was dead. She claims the second suspect vanished last Tuesday while police were digging in a relative’s yard. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbele said: “The area was searched but nothing was found. Police are investigating cases of kidnapping and murder.” Cele’s spokeswoman Reneilwe Serero asked the family to send details of the case to his office so the minister could see how he could assist.
