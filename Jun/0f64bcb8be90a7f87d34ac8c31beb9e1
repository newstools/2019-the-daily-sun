TWO siblings aged nine and 10 haven’t been going to school since early last month. As a result, their angry parents have demanded that they be accepted back. According to their dad, the kids came home early one day and said they had been chased away. He and his wife then went to the school to find out why the kids were expelled, but the parents were apparently chased away as well. The parents said the kids were being mistreated and assaulted at the school in Tlhabane, near Rustenburg in North West. The abuse allegedly began in 2016 when the dad became an SGB member. He claimed he was removed from the SGB by the principal without a valid reason. He suspected this happened after he uncovered corruption. According to the parents, the kids would come home with wounds. So they opened assault cases. Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed two cases of assault were opened against teachers at the school. The father said: “When you ask why my kids were expelled, no one has an answer. I’d like them to go back to school. “If it’s me the school is fighting, don’t bring my children into it.” Education spokesman Elias Malindi said the department is investigating
