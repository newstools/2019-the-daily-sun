PMS is a real monthly struggle for many women and causes severe blows to work, education, relationships and daily life. Even though there isn't a cure for PMS a yet, there are things you can do make yourself feel better. Introducing iron-rich food (meat, fish and poultry) as well as supplements in your diet, maybe a good solution. A study, published in The American Journal of Epidemiology, done over 10 years with more than 3,000 women, has found that dietary iron may reduce the risk for premenstrual syndrome, while intake of potassium-rich foods like bananas and potatoes may increase it. These findings came after researchers studied 1,057 women with PMS and 1,968 control subjects. “Eating a balanced diet with a variety of foods,” she said, “is a good way to ensure that women are consuming important vitamins and minerals.” said Elizabeth R. Bertone-Johnson and warned against taking too much iron or consuming too little potassium because both of these changes in behaviour can be harmful, so hang onto to those potatoes and just eat everything in moderation.
