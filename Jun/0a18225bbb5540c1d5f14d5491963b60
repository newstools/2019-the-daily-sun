ACTION-STARVED local heavyweight Justice “Venda Viper” Silinga hopes the wheels of fortune turn in his favour this year. Siliga sweated throughout last year, hard at gym and preparing for fights that ended with a cancellation. Lady Luck seems to have deserted him as seven of his proposed fights were aborted. The muscular fighter has fought twice this year. In both outings he survived a knockout and won on a split decision. Siliga, who is also a fitness instructor, hopes to keep his winning streak as he challenges Ruann “The Giant King” Visser for the SA heavyweight crown at Time Square Casino in Menlyn, Pretoria, on 23 June. At stake will also be a vacant World Boxing Association (WBA) Pan African heavyweight strap. This will be Siliga’s second attempt on liftng the national title. The boxer from Loius Trichard, in Limpopo, failed to dethrone former heavyweight titlist and seasoned warrior Osborne “Big Daddy” Machimana at the Dr Molemela Indoor Centre in Bloemfontein in October 2017. “This is a make-or-break championship. There’s no excuse for me not to win the fight. I had everything a top contender needs when he prepares for a tough battle. I’ve never been in such shape,” he said. “I got a bit rusty in my previous two clashes. But I’m happy with the victory. It’s helped me get in better shape for Ruann. “Winning the SA title has been always part of my dreams and the WBA regional belt will be the cherry on top.” The 31-year-old fighter said he has learnt that going to the gym every day doesn’t guarantee one a fight. According to him, such circumstances build someone’s character. His trainer, Alan Toweel, said his charge will emit his anger and long wait in the ring against Visser. “We take this fight seriously. A victory means a lot to us. Visser’s camp disrespected us. I sat down with 5th Elements. They were not willing to fight us until Boxing SA forced to them to do so.” said Toweel.
