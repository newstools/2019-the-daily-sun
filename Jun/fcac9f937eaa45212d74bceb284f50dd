 Two people have died, and twenty others were injured in a
Bus Crash on Umbilo Road and Hillier Road in Umbilo in KwaZulu Natal. The Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said paramedics
arrived on the scene to find total chaos. He said a bus and a car had collided before the vehicles
left the roadway coming to rest on the pavement. “Both occupants in the light motor vehicle were severely
entrapped in the wreckage and there was nothing more paramedics could do for
them and they were declared deceased on the scene,” said Garrith. Jamieson said twenty occupants from the bus had sustained
various injuries and were stabilised on the scene by Rescue Care Paramedics
before being transported to various Durban Hospitals for the further care that
they required. “At this stage the cause of the collision is unknown,
however SAPS will be investigating further,” he said.
