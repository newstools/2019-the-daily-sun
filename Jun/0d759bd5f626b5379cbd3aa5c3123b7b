SOMETIMES church can be boring, especially for the youngsters. But a funeral video circulating on social media is making youth want to join this particular church. The video of congregants dancing in different dance styles appears to have been taken at a cemetery. “Church people are judgmental and would look at you as if you’re crazy when you dance your sins away,” said Thapelo Mbatha. Ntombikayise Sibeko said: “I want to join this church. If elders have this vibe and do the vosho like this, imagine the freedom it gives the younger generation to express themselves.” Mbulelo Mphafa said: “Juju must attend this church, otherwise his vosho skills will never be on point.” Mbulelo Zulu said: “I’ve been looking for this kind of church and I think I’ll be a perfect fit. I already feel like a member. Send location, please!” Pastor Mntimande Ngwenya said youth musn’t go to church only to dance. “Young people can dance for the Lord but that shouldn’t be the sole purpose. It’s worse as that video was taken at a funeral where there should be respect for the dead. Church is church and clubbing is clubbing,” he said.
