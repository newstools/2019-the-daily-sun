ICAMAGU livumile! That’s how advocate Nomgcobo Jiba reacted when the Constitutional Court dismissed the General Council of the Bar’s application for leave to appeal the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment. “She is emotional. She was too distraught to speak when I called her. She only said: ‘Icamagu livumile’,” said her lawyer, Zola Majavu. Loosely translated, the expression means, the spirits agree. The Bar Council wanted to appeal the Supreme Court’s judgment. This overturned the North Gauteng High Court’s ruling that Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi were “not fit and proper” to practise as advocates. Following that judgment, the two were struck off the roll of advocates on 15 September 2016. They approached the Supreme Court, which overturned the High Court’s ruling. But the Bar Council approached the Constitutional Court for relief. The Constitutional Court ruled that the application had failed to raise constitutional issues. Justice Chris Jafta’s judgment was that the Bar Council had not established that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the constitutional court. Charges against Jiba and Mrwebi arose from complaints of misconduct in three cases involving former KZN Hawks boss Johan Booysen, former head of Crime Intelligence Richard Mdluli and the spy tapes.
