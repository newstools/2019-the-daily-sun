A FORMER security guard who last week became an EFF councillor this week vowed to fight labour brokers. Ellijah Nhlangulela (37) from Zwelethu squatter camp in Umlazi, south of Durban, attended his first eThekwini council meeting on Wednesday when mayor Zandile Gumede delivered her budget. He was one of five new EFF councillors who replaced councillors fired earlier this year after being found guilty of stealing party funds. Nhlangulela thanked his party for showing trust in him and said he’d fight for all security guards in the municipality, whether or not they were hired through labour brokers. “Guards have been exploited for too long in this country, but the EFF has started seeing municipalities like Joburg and Tshwane insourcing them,” said Nhlangulela. “As a former guard myself, I want to promise my former colleagues that I’ll do my best to represent them.” He said as a councillor he earns 10 times as much as he did when he was a guard but will not leave his shack. EFF regional chairman Mlebuka Hlengwa, also a new councillor, said the party was for poor people and they were not ashamed of making a security guard a councillor. “We’re coming here to reinforce the EFF voice in the municipality. “We’ve already started by teaching other councillors there’s a big difference between land occupation and invasion. “EFF people are occupying land, not invading.”
