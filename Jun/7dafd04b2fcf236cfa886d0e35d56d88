ABOUT 200 children from the Bright Horizon Community Centre marched with others from the community in Phomolong, Tshwane. The children marched on Friday to raise awareness of Child Protection Week. Nonhlanhla Ringane (64) said she volunteered at the centre because she was touched by the situation of abused children. “We decided to march because the children wanted people to see that enough is enough.” Nonhlanhla said all the kids wanted to be on the streets to show their anger. “We wanted to encourage people to protect children from human trafficking, as well as from physical and emotional abuse.” Nonhlanhla said the children at the centre told them they were scared of drug addicts and their uncles and stepfathers at home. “The kids are appealing to government to intervene and to give those who abuse them a heavy sentence,” she said. She said the centre also took the kids to church. “Child abuse must end because it’s destroying their future,” Nonhlanhla said. She said children who went to the centre were given love, clothing and good food. Volunteer Allina Vukela (72) said: “Helping the children with clothes helps us practise Christianity.” She said they wanted the children to grow up in a good environment and not to be ashamed. Nonhlanhla said the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Tshwane helped the kids with food, clothes and the word of God.
