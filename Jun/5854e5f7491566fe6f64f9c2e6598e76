SHE
recently shocked the nation when she aired her dirty laundry, accusing her
former record label of owing her money. It didn’t stop there, Zahara real name
Bulelwa Mtukuta also revealed that she realised she had a problem with the green
bottle when she downed a bottle of wine by herself – much to the amusement of
social media users. Both
former record label bosses denied the allegations that they owe the star money,
saying she was paid all the money that was due to her. However,
all that drama and those shocking revelations seem to be working for the Loliwe
hitmaker, who since the reveal, has enjoyed booking. She even bragged about
being booked until December. It
seems Zahara has gotten her mojo back and is still a fan favourite. The
songstress posted several recent pictures of herself performing to a pleased
audience at Port Elizabeth’s Board Casino. Thank you Port Elizabeth ?? Dressed by @thandopiliso_ A post shared by  Bulelwa Mkutukana (@zaharasa) on Jun 14, 2019 at 4:25am PDT
