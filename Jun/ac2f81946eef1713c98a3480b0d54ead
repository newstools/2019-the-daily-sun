IT will be a huge mistake for Kaizer Chiefs to fire their under pressure head coach Ernst Middendorp! This is an opinion of former Amakhosi defender David Kannemeyer who believes the German born mentor is the right man to bring Chiefs’ glory days back. The 60-year-old replaced the fired Italian Giovanni Solinas in December as the team have been struggling. But this made things worse for the Soweto giants as they failed to end the season in the top eight for the first time in 11 years. They finished in a disappointing ninth place. However, the most embarrassing thing for Chiefs was losing 1-0 to National First Division side FC Galaxy in the Nedbank Cup final last month. And that has made their fans angry and are now calling for the former Bloemfontein Celtic and Maritzburg United coach to be fired. Cape Town City head coach Benni McCarthy has been tipped as the right person to replace Middendorp. “I think when Ernst came to the club it was too late,” said the former Bafana Bafana defender. “There was no miracle he could have performed. The team have been struggling for the past three seasons with same squad. Now Chiefs should give him a chance to start a new season and allow him to sign his own players. It will not solve anything by hiring new coach. To me that will be a big mistake.” He added: “Ernst has won Chiefs trophies before and understands the expectations of the club. To me he is the right man.” The 41-year-old who has also played for Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns also asks how some of the players were signed by the Soweto giants. “It is for everyone to see that some players are not Chiefs material. The club needs quality players like Downs ,” said Kannemeyer who won the PSL title three times, twice with Downs and once with Chiefs. “ The club must release players who are not Chiefs material.”
