THE Mpumalanga Education Department wants the best for matric pupils. According to Education MEC Bonakele Majuba, the department has put aside R17 million to improve the performance of pupils during winter. Majuba said this at the launch of the 2019 winter school classes at Sibhulo High School in Kabokweni, outside White River, on Tuesday. He said the winter classes are compulsory for schools that achieved less than 70% in last year’s matric results. The classes will take place for a period of 10 days in 63 centres. They are meant for 12 759 matric pupils across the province. “The classes will focus on identified challenging content and cover the highly enrolled subjects. “ Teachers with a proven track record, who achieved satisfactory results in the previous years, have already been appointed to teach the pupils,” he said. “We urge our pupils to take advantage of the opportunity and make this time work for them.”
