AFTER getting their 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup campaign off to adisappointing start, South Africa will be eager to get back on track as soon as possible. The Proteas fell to a 104-run thumping at the hands of hosts and tournament favourites, England, in the opening match played at the Oval in London on Thursday. But they’ve had little time to dwell on that result, as they’re set to lock horns with Bangladesh at the same venue today (11am SA time) in their second match of the tournament. The batting front is again the area the Proteas need to improve if they have any hope of making history by clinching their maiden World Cup. In the defeat to England, only Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen made substantial contributions in the Proteas top order, which is their Achilles heel. But captain Faf du Plessis believes they have enough time to iron out the kinks in their game, with eight more matches remaining before the knockout stages. “As much as we’re disappointed with the loss to England, we’ll want to learn from it quickly,” Du Plessis said. “We want to move on and learn from it quickly because we have to play good cricket again.” The Proteas will be confident of victory against the Tigers, as Bangladesh are affectionately known, having beaten them in 17 of the 20 ODI matches they’ve played. The Proteas bowling attack,spearheaded by Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi with the support of AndilePhehlukwayo, are expected to rise to the occasion once again against the Tigers.
