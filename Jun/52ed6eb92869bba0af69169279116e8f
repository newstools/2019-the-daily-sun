 AS if being bust for alleged human trafficking wasnâ€™t
enough, a suspect tried to use fake documents in court. Ellias Chukwuemeka (33) was slapped with another charge
after he produced a fake document in the Witbank Magistrate's Court. When Chukwuemeka appeared before the Witbank Magistrate
Court he was not aware that it would turn bad. He was appearing on human traffic case but, suddenly it was
found that he was in possession of fake documents. Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi said his
bail application has been abandoned after he produced fraudulent Asylum seeker
document and additional charges for fraud added. Sekgotodi said it alleged that on the 31 May, a victim from
neighbouring country escaped from the place in Witbank where she was enslaved
by the suspect. She said the suspect allegedly gave her drugs and repeatedly
raped her before she could be sent to the street to join other girls and pose
as prostitution. The victim told the police that she was promised job by her friend
to come to South Africa. An arrangement was made, and she travelled until to Witbank
where she was picked by the suspect who took her to the place where she joined
other girls. The victim managed to escape and was assisted by the
community members to open a case in Witbank. The case is postponed to 5th July 2019 for further police
investigation
