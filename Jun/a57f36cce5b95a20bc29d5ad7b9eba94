Swidakwa FC has been on a mission to win soccer tournaments since its formation in 2010. And on Saturday afternoon, the club’s vision finally came true. They beat Return Africa FC 1-0 to win a trophy and R6 000 cash prize. The game was organised by the Kruger National Park’s Return Africa Lodge to encourage the youth to participate in sport. The derby was played at the Makuleke Sports Ground on Saturday. Tiyani Khosa of Swidakwa FC shot the winning goal past Return Africa FC goalkeeper, Dicks Maluleke, in the 35th minute of the game. Swidakwa FC dominated the game in the first and second halves. Strikers Tsako Maluleke and Tinyiko Baloyi missing several chances to increase the lead. Return Africa FC striker Cyril Halata tried to score the equaliser in the 80th minute. But his short failed to find the back of the net. About 89 minutes before the final whistle, Swidakwa FC striker Tinyiko Mathebula came close to scoring the second goal. But his powerful short was denied by Return Africa FC’s goalkeeper. Swidakwa FC coach Stanley Maluleke (44) was happy about winning the trophy and prize money. Said the coach: “I feel like I’m dreaming. “I can’t believe my team has won the trophy and the prize money, for the first time ever in the club’s history. “The boys’performance was out of this world. They played like they were possessed by demons. “Next Saturday, I’m going to spoil them with a braai.” Opposition coach, Nyiko Khosa (36), was disappointed. Insisted Nyiko: “I told my players not to defend too deep, but they chose not to follow my instructions. “They lost their concentration and ended up conceding the goal. “The only thing we need to do right now is to go home and correct all our mistakes.”
