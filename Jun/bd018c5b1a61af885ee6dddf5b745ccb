SOCIAL media users have demanded that nurses be called to order for apparently shaming the profession and the country. This was after a video surfaced on social media recently, showing nurses pushing each other for food! And turns out, it was food meant for patients. The incident happened at two hospitals in Cala and Hewu in Eastern Cape, according to the department of health. The video was captioned: “Our beloved nurses fighting for food but don’t want to fight to help patients.” Social media users slammed the greedy nurses and said they were tired of all the healthcare horror stories they have been hearing about recently. “Most of them are in it for the pay cheque. And I speak from having my parents in a private hospital where the nurses also do not give a damn. “There are very few who are absolutely amazing but the bad ones make the good ones seem non-existent because there are so many bad ones.” Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said appropriate action would be taken against the violation of patients’ right to food. “This is to ensure our patients continue to receive a balanced diet on a daily basis. “The department will take decisive action against those who might be involved in this gross violation of departmental food policy,” said Kupelo.
