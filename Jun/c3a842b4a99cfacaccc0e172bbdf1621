people need to know that councillors are here to serve them. This was the message from Traditional Affairs MEC Thembeni Ngcangisa to councillors at a meeting held at the Kaiser Sebothelo Stadium in Botshabelo, Free State, on Tuesday. “People must participate in decision-making, budgeting and tackle service delivery issues,” he said. The meeting was attended by Premier Sisi Ntombela, MECs, mayors, heads of departments and councillors. “We want to create jobs. People are tired of empty promises,” said Ngcangisa. “As a municipality we must improve communication with the community. Councillors must hold meetings with the community to give them feedback. “All councils and councillors are going to report to the traditional affairs department. “We’re going to intervene if councillors are making people suffer because of poor service delivery.” Smithfield ward councillor Potlaki Morapela said they have unfinished libraries, clinics, bad roads and schools that need repairs. Ntombela told the councillors and mayors that if they wanted to be respected, they must first change people’s lives. “Don’t just talk. Even after your term has ended, people never forget about you,” she said. “There are people who’re more qualified than me who’re unemployed. “No matter which party they belong to, they must get help because they’re also Free State people.” She said there are people crying about sewage, water and jobs. “They must get help. We’re their only hope.”
