THREE cops were bust for trying to force Ekurhuleni Human Settlements MMC Lesiba Mpya to pay them R5million. The arrests on Wednesday were a joint operation by the police and Ekurhuleni Metro cops. According to Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina’s spokeswoman Phakamile Mbengashe, the accused claimed they had a report with evidence of corruption by Mpya, Masina, city manager Dr Imogen Mashazi and other top officials. She said the accused demanded Mpya pay to make it disappear. “Upon receiving these demands, Mpya approached the police and opened a case of extortion and corruption,” said Mbengashe. She said Mpya participated in an operation on Wednesday evening, where he dropped off money at a venue arranged by the suspects. She said upon handing over the money, police arrested the suspects. “Investigations into the officials revealed they were connected to multiple anonymous WhatsApp messages that went viral in March, making false claims of corruption.” They will appear in court soon.
