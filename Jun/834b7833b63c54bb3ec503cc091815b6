MYSTERY surrounds an investigation into allegations that a gorilla swallowed R274 000 being kept at a zoo. Four suspects, including security officials and an accountant, have been arrested and charged following the alleged incident at Kano Zoological Gardens. It was reported the money was from the gate takings of a Muslim festival. Authorities said it was unlawful to keep such large amounts of money at the zoo. “Whoever is implicated at the end of the investigations will be taken to court,” said regional police spokesperson Abdullahi Haruna. Reports have emerged that no gorillas are kept at Kano. Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has ordered the anti-corruption commission to investigate. Commentator Sylvester Udemezue said animals had been at the centre of mystery in Nigeria. Last year, a senator allegedly stole R2,8 million meant for legislators and claimed it had been swallowed by monkeys. An examinations board official was arrested for allegedly stealing R1,45 million, claiming it was swallowed by a snake kept in her office. In 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari had to leave his office after rats reportedly ravaged it while he was out of the country. – CAJ NEWS
