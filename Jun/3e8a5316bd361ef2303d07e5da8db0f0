PORTIA Mayeki (32) from Nyanga is tired of being sent from pillar to post by Home Affairs. Portia, from Nyanga, told the SunTeam she’s been trying to help her deaf uncle Andries Mayeki (62), who’s never had an ID or birth certificate. She’s been to Nyanga Home Affairs and the Khayelitsha office without success. “They told me to bring information but in the end, they said it wasn’t enough for an ID. They said they wanted to check if I didn’t just get a random person,” she said in tears. Portia knows Andries was born in Hout Bay. She said when her grandparents got married in 1959, her gogo Joanna Mayeki brought adopted Andries with her. “She died in 2002 but I was young then, so I couldn’t get any information to help us on my uncle’s background. “My dead dad also tried to get him an ID but didn’t succeed.” “My uncle is asthmatic and needs medication but I always have to negotiate because he doesn’t have an ID.” When the SunTeam asked why she didn’t ask her gogo’s family for more information, Portia said there were problems with them. Home Affairs spokesman David Hlabane said the family could speak to Yusuf Simons at the Western Cape office for help.
